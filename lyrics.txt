
Each day I’ll do a golden deed
By helping those who are in need
My life on earth is but a span
And so I’ll do the best I can
   Life’s evening sun is sinking low
   A few more days and I must go
   To meet the deeds that I have done
   Where there will be no setting sun
To be a child of God each day
My life must shine along the way
I’ll sing His praise while the ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul
While going down life’s weary road
I’ll try to lift some traveler’s load
I’ll try to turn the night to day
Make flowers bloom along the way
The only life that will endure
Is one that’s kind and good and pure
And so for God, I’ll take my stand
Each day I’ll lend a helping hand

I was born in the heart of the country
In a town in the middle of the land
I grew up in a second city
Since I left my home I’ve been travellin’ back. 
To a time when a family tried to stay together
Back to the time when a love survived
When a woman and a man built a home forever
And they tied a knot for the rest of their lives. 
My brother’s gone to New York City
And I find myself in a corner of the west
My mom and daddy left their home and each other
Ten miles apart, more apart than the rest. 
I’m singing songs of the poor and the homeless
I’m singing songs of a love that died
But my saddest song is the song of a family
A million miles apart with a broken tie.


Oh tonight dear I’m thinking of days long gone by 
Of my childhood sweetheart who left me to cry
Amid broken vows now you left me alone
I wonder if my heart can lead you back home
I wonder if my heart can lead you back home
Now once we were happy with love in our hearts
Stole each night together vowed never to part
But a new love has won you with him you’ll abide
You’re happy my darling but I’m left to cry
You’re happy my darling but I’m left to cry
Oh meet me my darlin please meet me alone
We’ll stroll once together where often we roamed
And if you are sure that your new love is right
My heart will be blue as a dark starless night
My heart will be blue as a dark starless night

I remember very well
On one dark and dreary day
Just as I was leaving home
For a distant land to roam
   Mother said (mother said)
   My dear boy (my dear boy)
   I hope to see you next year again
   Fare you well (fare you well)
   fare you well (fare you well)
   So I left my dear old home
   For a distant land to roam
Now I wandered far away
From my home I’ve gone astray
Now I’m coming coming home
Never more from thee to roam
And these words she said to me
As she took me by the hand
If on earth we meet no more
May we meet at God’s right hand

A face in the crowd on your wedding day
You tossed me a rosebud from your bridal bouquet
No one seemed to notice no one wondered why
When you pledged your love to him there were tears in my eyes.
   A face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose
   Your gown of white satin my half-worn-out clothes
   I knew your love one time but your love now he holds
   I’m a face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose.
As your friends they all kissed you I heard someone say
The man with the rosebud from your bridal bouquet
Was he kind of special or was he just a friend
I heard you speak softly he was only a friend.

   A lock of your hair and a faded red ribbon
   Is all I have left to remind me of you
   A lock of your hair and a faded red ribbon
   Is all I have left of a love we once knew
   Is all I have left of a love we once knew
I know I mistreated you and you went away
You found somebody new and now I must pay
Listen here boys if you have a sweetheart
Show her you love her and make her your wife
For the lock of her hair and a faded red ribbon
Will make you unhappy for the rest of your life
Will make you unhappy for the rest of your life
listen here boys is you have a sweetheart
Show her you love her and make her your wife

A star fell from heaven right into my arms
A brighter star I know I’ve never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
   A fallen star is what you are
   The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
   you must have strayed from the milky way
   A fallen star that’s what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I’m sure they’ll miss a star as bright as you
But the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
When they see the dream that’s comin’ true

Mother first was called to heaven
Left our home all alone
Dad took sick soon and joined her
They’re reunited on god’s throne
   A few more tiring days still face us
   A few more weary nights shall come
   We’ll all be on our way to heaven
   When a few more seasons come
In springtime when the flowers blossom
Spreading their fragrance through the air
Walking through the little churchyard
Soon we’ll all be resting there

A few more years shall roll, a few more seasons shall come
Then we shall be with those at rest asleep within the tomb
   Then Oh my Lord prepare my soul for that great day
   Wash me in Thy precious blood and take my sins all away
A few more meetings here shall cheer us on our way
And we shall reach that endless rest on that eternal day

Just a few old memories slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it so tightly before
I can’t understand it why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place in time
   Just a few old keepsakes way back on the shelf
   No they don’t mean nothing I’m surprised that they’re left
   Just a few old love letters with their edges all brown
   And an old faded picture I keep turned upside down
Just a few old memories going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember I don’t know why I’m crying
I can’t understand it well I’m surprised at my self
First thing tomorrow morning I’ll clean off that shelf

On one evening long ago as the sun was sinking low
My true lover went to sail up in the sea
It was in the month of June when the roses were in bloom
When he tucked me in his arms and said to me
   You’re a flower that is blooming in the wildwood
   A flower that is blooming there for me
   Sweeter than the morning dew and I’ll soon return to you
   You’re a flower that is blooming there for me
Then a letter came to me from the captain on the sea
That told me my darling was dead
Oh the shock and great surprise made the teardrops dim my eye
When I thought about the last words that he said
Now he can’t return to me he got drowned in the sea
And has done passed over life’s weary way
When it’s in the month of June and the roses are in bloom
It seems that I can hear my lover say

Pardon me if I’m sentimental when we say goodbye
Don’t be angry with me darling should I cry
When you’re gone I’ll dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there’s a fool such as I
   Now and then there’s a fool such as I am over you
   You thaught me how to love and now you say that we are thru
   I’m a fool but I love you dear until the end of time
   Now and then there’s a fool such as I

Whipoor wills and daffodils are pretty things
All the works of nature that we see each spring
All the pretty colors at a rainbows end
Could never match the beauty on your face I’ve seen
You brought me laughter you gave me joy
You brought me pleasure like a kid with a Christmas toy
You brought me sunshine from up above
And that’s not all you brought you gave me love
Honeysuckles morning glories ’round my door
Honey bees that gather nectar and much more
Smiling faces childrens laughter skies above
All that I could ask form them you gave me love

I was a rover, on land and on sea
’til a good woman’s love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
’til a good woman’s love put me back on my feet
   Still a-roamin’ I go home in the evening and she’s waiting there
   and I know that no matter what happens she’ll always care
   and when night falls and the moon shines above
   I’m a man with a dream and a good woman’s love

   Well a hundred years from now I won’t be crying
   A hundred years from now I won’t be blue
   And my heart will have forgotten that she broke every vow
   I won’t care a hundred years from now
Oh, it seems like only yesterday you told me
You couldn’t live without my love somehow
Now that you’re with another it breaks my heart somehow
I won’t care a hundred years from now
Now do you recall the night sweetheart you promised
Another’s kiss you never would allow
That’s all in the past dear it didn’t seem to last
I won’t care a hundred years from now

I’ve wandered by the village Tom I’ve set beneath the tree
Upon the schoolhouse playing ground that sheltered you and me
But none are left to greet me Tom and few are left to know
That played with us upon the green just fifteen years ago
The river’s running just as still the willows on its side
Are larger than they were dear Tom the stream appears less wide
But in kneeling down beside the stream dear Tom I startled so
To see how sadly I am changed since fifteen years ago
But when our time shall come dear Tom and we are called to go
I hope they’ll lay us where we played just fifteen years ago
Just fifteen years ago

After traveling through this world of sorrow
No one on earth to call my friend
I’m on my way back to old Kentucky
Where I met and loved but could not win.
I’ve always loved you little darling
My heart will always feel the same
I could never do one thing to hurt you
I’d rather die than bring you shame.
When that cold dark shroud is wrapped around me
They lay my weary head to rest
Will you stand around and gaze upon me
For I’m the one that loved you best
When your golden hair is turned to silver
The master calls your soul to heaven
Where we can be free from all our troubles
I’ll meet you there at journey’s end

In a war torn land of poverty somewhere across the sea
A little boy is waitin’ he looks a lot like me
His hair is like the sunlight on the wings of a crow
I don’t know what they named him but I’m sure they called him Joe
   Just a little boy called Joe like so many more I know
   Left all alone somewhere across the sea
   I want him to have my name little Joe mine to claim
   A little boy called Joe belongs to me
His mother died to give him life the night my orders came
I wanted to be with him but war’s an evil thing
Now he won’t recongnize me but I’ve got to let him know
He means much more to some one than just a little boy called Joe

In the pale moonlight we quarreled one night
Our hearts were young and free
I left her there alone at night
I thought she was two-timin’ me
   On a lonesome night and far from home
   I heard a mourn-ful sound
   The girl I love is call-in’ me
   She thinks I turned her down
She begged me not to leave her there
She said she had been true
But a jealous heart would not believe
Oh how I long for you
So now I’m on my way back home
Sweetheart do you still care
I promise never to leave your side
And your love I always share

I bid farewell to my home so dear
And started down life’s road
I was a fortune seeking miner dear
Many things had been my goal
There’s many things I’ve seen in life
I thought I’d like to own
But I’d give them all and more if I
Could get off this lonesome road
It’s a lonesome road to travel on
Many miles of sorrow is all I’ve known
But I’ve gone too far to turn back now
From this lonesome lonesome road
I left behind a love that’s true
She cried and begged me not to go
But my foolish pride told me what to do
And put me on this lonesome road
Oh such lonely nights I’ve never found
No time in life before
If she takes me back I’ll settle down
And travel this road no more

I am a man of constant sorrow
I’ve seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised
For six long years I’ve been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I find
For in this world I’m bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
It’s fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I’m bound to ride that Northern railroad
Perhaps I’ll die upon this train
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
It’s fare you well to a native country
The places I have loved so well
For I have seen all kinds of trouble
In this cruel world no tongue can tell
Maybe your friends think I’m a stranger
My face your’ll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I’ll meet you on God’s golden shore

I turned the key in the lock tonight
And walked slowly into the room
Your presence hung like a heavy mist
And I knew death had come to soon
The stars maybe shining for somebody else
The moon maybe giving us light
But all that I have is a memory of you
And I’m lost in a world black as night
Death came too soon to the one that I love
And now I must travel alone
Just a wanderin’ boy with a broken heart
Whose sweetheart and pal is now gone
I’ll travel on through this world of dispair
I’ll just force myself to go on
I find myself wishing ev-‘ryday
I could be with her in the beyond

In my memory there’s a picture of a face so dear to me
Loving arms that used to hold me as I sat on mother’s knee
No one here on earth could pay her for the things in life she gave
Now she’s gone but I’ll remember’ a pretty wreath for mother’s grave
   She was fond of pretty flowers
   I recall she used to say
   When I’m gone son please remember
   A pretty wreath for mother’s grave
She had a little row of flowers that she used to watch each day
She fixed them just before God called her so they would not fade away
Next year they’ll bloom again in beauty red and blue so bright and gay
If it’s God’s will I’ll take them to her a pretty wreath for mother’s grave

While strolling through the fields of time there’s many things to see
But nature is the greatest sight that could ever be
But the greatest of them all is how the world was formed
And why the roses had to live each day among the thorns
 One day among the world of thorns a rose began to grow
 It was the greatest gift of God this world will ever know
 It was the will of God to show that since the world was formed
 There had to be a rose to live and die among the thorns
Two thousand years will soon be gone since God looked down with love
He filled this earth with beauty with roses from above
He hung upon a rugged cross to save the world from sin
Between two thorns this rose He died three days He bloomed again
 

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I’d do things my way
How little they know that it’s so hard to find
One rich man in a hundred with a satisfied mind
Once I was living in fortune and fame
Had everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life’s game
Then suddenly it happened I lost every dime
But I’m richer by far with a satisfied mind
Money can’t buy back your youth when you’re old
Or a friend when you’re lonely or a heart that’s grown cold
And the world’s richest man is a pauper at times
Compared to a man with a satisfied mind
When my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I’ll leave there’s no doubt
But one thing’s for certain when it comes my time
I’ll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

You’ll never find a sweeter love
Than the love you gave to me
But I would not be satisfied
Now you no longer care for me.
   Now you’ve gone and left me alone
   Oh why did I ever let you go?
   In this world I can never find
   A sweeter love than yours I’ll never know.
Now my future looks so cold
So cold without you my dear
I realize that I’m to blame
But for my wrong I’m paying dear.
Now I think of you both night and day
I’m sorry dear I ever let you go
I know now that it’s too late
A sweeter love than yours I’ll never know.

He was just a little farm lad so busy at play
In his little play house down by the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate
   Then he saw his Daddy watching too
   As the man swiftly walked to the cottage door
   He knew they were strangers that come from the town
   Men he had never seen before
They soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no he cried dear God don’t let it be
They can’t take my sweetheart away
   I know Dad that you don’t understand
   How a heart so young can conceive a plan
   I’m only seven now but it’s just like you said
   Dad someday I’ll be a man
The man who runs the farm where your playmate now lives
He told me it’d have to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done
So now they are moving away
   Let us buy the farm so they can stay
   Give them all my toys that dear Santa gave
   And give him the pennies in my little bank
   Pennies that my darling helped me save

There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on
I lost two points just for being in the right place at exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there but I may as well have been completely blind.
But if you see me walking all alone
Don’t look back ’cause I’m on my way back home
There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on.
Signing ink to the contract
baby
said it would all be so lifelong
Looked around then for the reason when there wasn’t something more to blame it on.
So if time makes a difference while we’re gone
Tell me now and I won’t be hangin’ on
There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on.
Thirteen-twenty
North Colombus was the address I had written on my sleeve
Don’t know what it was she wanted
might have been that it was gettin’ time to leave.
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed as the joker said
lead on
There’s a train leaves here this mornin’
I don’t know but what I might be on.

Oft’ my thoughts drift back to childhood
To the time when I was free
As I played before the fireside
‘Round my darling Mother’s knee
   There’s a blessed home up yonder
   Where my loved ones wait for me
   I saw Mother in a vision
   Kneeling there to pray for me
Then one day our Mother left us
Daddy said she’d gone to rest
I remember how she loved me
As she clutched me to her breast
Some sweet day I’ll meet you Mother
Your little boy is commin’ home
To see you as in days of childhood
The one you loved and left alone

   I hear a voice callin’
   it must be our Lord
   It’s comin’ from heaven on high
   I hear a voice callin’
   I’ll gain the reward
   In the land where we shall never shall die
The Savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I’ll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day
He died on the cross
the old rugged cross
That we would be saved from sin and not lost
So I’ll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
And we’ll pay that debt on the great judgement day

Many thousand miles away in that land across the sea
There are soldier boys their precious lives they give
So their loved ones here back home many miles across the foam
Might have liberty each padding day to live
May they sleep forevermore
Where a white cross stands to mark the soldiers grave
May their spirits be at rest
They have done their part with hearts so true and brave
May the ones who have gone on be remembered here back home
In the hearts of those whom they will see no more
They will wait until that day when they hear the trumpet play
Then they’ll march again upon that golden shore

It still grieves me when I wander
To the grave not far away
Where we laid my little darling
Just a year ago today
It broke my heart so when she left
But she did not go alone
The greatest part of me went with her
The day the savior called her home
As I looked back across my life time
As I journey on and on
I bless the days that I had with her
And I leave the rest to God
In a grave so dark and lonely
Neath the cold and silent clay
There we laid my little darling
Just a year ago today

   Abilene Abilene
   Prettiest town I’ve ever seen
   Women there will treat you mean
   In Abilene my Abilene
I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don’t I wish they were carrying me
Back to Abilene my Abilene
Crowded city there ain’t nothing free
Nothing in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene sweet Abilene

The fairest bloom the mountain know
Is not an iris or a wild rose
But the little flower of which i’ll tell
Known as the brave acony bell
Just a simple flower so small and plain
With a pearly hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds sing when they see it bloom
For they know that spring is coming soon
Well it makes its home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies deep on the windy hills
And it tells the world “why should i wait
This ice and snow is gonna melt away”
And so i’ll sing that yellow bird’s song
For the troubled times will soon be gone

I’m going across the deep blue sea
In this country tell me
I’m all alone so sad and blue
My every thought is just fo you
In these long years that I spent here
I onely wish that you were here
To the dizzy fog and a mist of rain
I can see you strolling right down the lane
Someday darling I will return
Then our hearts will no longer yearn
Things will be just like before
Just your and I forever more

    I’m going across the deep blue sea
    In this country here are we
    I’m all alone so sad and blue
    My every thought is just of you
In these long years that I spent here
I only wish that you were here
Through the dizzy fog and a misty rain
I can see you strolling right down the lane
Someday darling I will return
Then our hearts will no longer yearn
Things will be just like before
Just you and I forever more
Most every night I see your face
With thoughts of you I can’t erase
In this land so far apart
You’ll always be here in my heart

Adieu false heart now we must part
May the joys of the world go with you
I’ve loved you long with a faithful heart
But never any more can I believe you
I’ve seen the time I’d have married you
And been your constant lover
But now I’d gladly give you up
For one whose heart is truer
You think you are too good for me
You think I am forsaken
But if you think that I care for you
You are very much mistaken
My mind is like the constant sun
From the east to the west it ranges
While yours is likened to the moon
It’s every month it changes
When I lay down to take my rest
No scornful one to wake me
I’ll go straightaway unto my grave
Just as fast as time can take me
Adieu false heart now we must part
May the joys of the world go with you
I’ve loved you long with a faithful heart
But never any more can I believe you

   Love is where you find it
   When you find no love at home
   And there’s nothin’ cold as ashes
   After the fire is gone
The bottle is almost empty
The clock just now struck ten
Darlin’ i had to call you
To our favorite place again
I know it’s wrong for us to meet
But the fires gone out at home
And there’ nothin’ cold as ashes
After the fire is gone
Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot
Each time we say it’s the last time
But we keep hangin’ on
And there’s nothin’ cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

I’ve been up and down and around and ’round and back again
I’ve been so many places I can’t remember where or when
And my only boss is the clock on the wall and my only friend
Never really was a friend at all
   Well I traded love for pennies and sold my soul for less
   Lost my deals in that long tunnel of time
   And I turned inside out and ’round about and back again
   Found myself right back where I started again.
Once I had myself a million now I’ve only got a dime
The difference don’t seem quite as bad today
With a nickle or million I was searchin’ all the time
For something that I’ve never lost or left behind.
And now I’m in my second circle and I’m headin’ for the top
I’ve learned a lot of things along the way
I’ll be careful while I’m climbing ’cause it hurts alot to drop
When you’re down nobody gives a damn anyway.

I remember when I made you cry
Ages and ages ago
I’ll never blame you for our last good bye
Ages and ages ago
Something told me when you walked away
That my poor heart would miss you so
And though it happened only yesterday
It seems like ages and ages ago
Someone came along and took my place
How wrong I was to let you go
And though it happened only yesterday
It seems like ages and ages ago

   I ain’t gonna work tomorrow
   Ain’t gonna work today
   Ain’t gonna work tomorrow, lord
   For that is my wedding day
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
But I’d leave them both to go with you
I’ve been all around this country
I’ve been all around this world
I’ve been all around this country, lord
For the sake of one little girl
I’m leaving you this lonesome song
I’m leaving you this lonesome song
I’m leaving you this lonesome song
Cause I’m gonna be gone before long

    Ain’t I been good to you
    Done all that I can do
    So faithful and so true
    Ain’t I been good to you
I’ve tried and tried and tried
To keep you satisfied
But you found somebody new
Even though I was good to you.
It’s causin’ me such pain
Sweetheart, I can’t explain
I can’t believe we’re through
‘Cause I’ve been so good to you.

    There ain’t no grave gonna hold my body down
    There ain’t no grave gonna hold my body down
    When I hear the trumpet sound
    Gonna get up outa the ground
    There ain’t no grave gonna hold my body down
  
Well go down yonder Gabriel
Put your foot on the land and sea
But don’t you blow that trumpet until you hear from me
 
Well look way over yonder
See people dressed in white
I know it was God’s people I seen ’em doin right
Oh look way over Jordan
What do you think I see
I see a band of angels and they’re comin’ after me 
Well I goin to the river of Jordan
Bury my knees in the sand
Gonna holler high Hosanna til I reach that promised land
Oh look way over yonder
What do you think I see
I see a band of angels and they’re comin’ after me 
Well meet me Jesus meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings should fail me there won’t be no other pair

Once I had a little sweetheart I love dearly
We planned the day when she would be my own
Another man he stole my darlin from me
And there ain’t nobody gonna miss me when I’m gone
   Oh there ain’t nobody gonna miss me when I’m gone
   There ain’t nobody gonna mourn for me too long
   Oh won’t you write these words upon my tombstone
   There ain’t nobody gonna miss me when I’m gone
I had a loving mother dear and daddy
They’ve gone to live where the angels love to dwell
They found eternal life up there in Heaven
Where I’ll find my reward no one can tell
Now you’ve been faithful kind and true to me old Copper
You’re the only one that’s never done me wrong
I am weeping while I pat your head old Copper
For there ain’t nobody gonna miss me when I’m gone

Left New York this morning early
Traveling south so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder
It’s that air mail special on the fly
Listen to the motors humming
She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that’s flying homeward
It’s that air mail special on the fly
Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California
It’s that air mail special on the fly
Watch her circle for the landing
Hear her moan and cough and sigh
Now she’s coming down the runway
It’s that air mail special on the fly

Alabama
your beautiful sunlight
Your fields of cerecea potatoes and corn
Alabama
your crimson red clover
All mingled around the old place I was born.
Alabama
your hills and your valleys
Your creeks with laughter as onward they flow
Alabama
so sweet in the springtime
Sweet ferns and wild flowers and winter with snow.
Alabama
so sweet to my mem’ry
You shine like a light on a beautiful hill
Alabama
in days of my childhood
I labored and toiled at the old sorghum mill
Alabama
when red leaves are failing
I roam through your pastures with fences of rail
Alabama
when ‘possums are crawling
And hound dogs are howling and wagging their tails.
Alabama
your beautiful highways
All curved through the mountains where love ones do wait
Alabama
your golden rod flower;
And the “Welcome home’ sign hanging over the gate
Alabama
to me you are callin’
My footsteps are haltered no longer to stray
Alabama
you hold all I long for
You hold all I love so I’m coming today
Blue Sky Boys; Sunny side of Life
Louvin Brothers; The Louvin Brothers

Well the preacher got drunk
He throwed his bible down
He told the congregation
I’m Alabama bound
   I’m Alabama bound
   I’m Alabama bound
   If the train don’t run
   I’ve got a mule to ride
Well I’ve been in New York City
And I’ve been in New York town
Good lord but I’ve been in the mountains
With the blues all around
I jumped in the river
And I started to drown
I spotted a red-headed woman
Good lord I couldn’t go down

I was sad and blue, down hearted too
It seemed like my whole world was lost
When I took a chance, and happened to dance
To the tune of the Alabama waltz.
Waltz, Waltz, the Alabama waltz
Where all my fears and troubles were lost
   
There in your arms, with all of your charms
We danced to the Alabama waltz.

I’m on my way to California
I’d rather go to Tennessee
Got in trouble down in Dixie
And it’s Alcatraz for me
Gee but I’m blue and I’m lonesome
No one seems to understand
Everybody thinks that I’m guilty
They say I shot a man
Well the evidence was circumstantial
They didn’t want the world to know
All about the kind of justice
That’s blind and it is so
Woman in Atlanta Georgia
Won’t you listen to my lonesome song
If they really knew that you shot him
You’d be where you belong
I’m on my way to California
I’d rather go to Tennessee
Got in trouble down in Dixie
And it’s Alcatraz for me

I see you there at the Brass Rail Bar
Somebody just asked you what sign you are
And I see you’re thinkin’ you maybe should’ve stayed home
But you’re tired of being alive and alone 
In your brand new hairdo, you look real fine
I hear you toast yourself, today you’re twenty-nine
And you’re riding on what the future brings
An honest man who wants the simple things. 
There’s Tiffany lamps here to brighten up the gloom
The conversation sounds like a locker room
Where will you find love, you’re living in a tiny world
And at the office they call you an old fashioned girl 
You sit so silent, sipping at a beer
Catching your reflection in a tinted mirror
And you shopped all day for that brand new dress
What a price to pay, for settling for less 
I see you there at the Brass Rail Bar
Somebody just asked you what sign you are
And I see you’re wishin’ you woulda just stayed home
But you’re tired of being alive and alone
Alive and alone Alive and alone
Alive and alone Alive and alone

   All I ever loved was you
   You broke a heart that cried for you
   I’ve wasted all my tears on you
   For all I’ve ever loved was you
Go out and find somebody new
But you’ll be sorry if you do
You’ll never find a love so true
For all I ever loved was you
Buy her rings and diamonds too
But you’ll be sorry if you do
You’ll never find a love so true
For all I ever loved was you

My friends tell me you’ve been untrue
I’ve known so long that I’d loose you
But won’t you sometimes think of me
Darling all I have is just a memory
I prayed to god so many times
That somehow you would change your mind
But now I’m losing you I see
Darling all I have is just a memory
The stars that used to shine so bright
Have gone behind the cloud tonight
Someone has taken you from me
Darling all I have is just a memory

I don’t need alot of money, or a mansion to behold
Don’t want a ship that sails the ocean blue
I won’t look for a hidden treasure, I found a love that’s true
That’s all that really matters now, ‘cause all I want is you.
I got a diamond ring that sparkles
And a golden band that shines
Let me place them on your finger
Say you’ll change your name to mine
I found the greatest treasure
I know you love me too
Don’t want money, ships or mansions now
‘Cause all I want is you.

I’m continually amazed with wonder
At all the things you do
There’s no escaping this spell I’m under
That’s all in my love for you.
Now I hold you close and hear you whisper
Your love for me is true
These are the words I try to say
That’s all in my love for you.
So as I am as we believe
in love songs when they’re new
And I believe in what I feel
That’s all in my love for you.
Those things I said the other night
When you had seen me blue
Your common sense for what is right
That’s all in my love for you.

   All my ex’s live in Texas
   And Texas is the place I’d dearly love to be
   But all my ex’s live in Texas
   And that’s why I hang my hat in Tennessee.
Rosanna’s down in Texarcana wanted me to push her broom
And sweet Arlene in Abilene she forgot I owned the moon
And Allison in Galviston somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple’s got the law looking for me.
I remember that old Rio river where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time when I wore my welcome thin
My transcendental meditation I go there each night
But I’ll always come back to myself long before daylight.
Some folks think I’m hiding
it’s been rumored that I died
But I’m alive and well in Tennessee.

I wish to the Lord I’d never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would a’ seen your sparklin’ blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue
   All the good times are past and gone
   All the good times are o’er
   All the good times are past and gone
   Little darlin’ don’t you weep no more.
Now don’t you see that turtle dove
Flyin from pine to pine
It’s mournin’ for It’s own true love
Just like I mourn for mine.
Come back, come back my own true love
And stay a while with me
For if ever I’ve had a friend in this world
You’ve been a friend to me

I wish to the lord I’d never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue
   All the good times are past and gone
   All the good times are o’er
   All the good times are past and gone
   Little darling don’t weep no more
Don’t you see that turtle dove
That flies from pine to pine
He’s mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
Come back, come back my own true love
And stay awhile with me
For if ever I’ve had a friend in this world
You’ve been that friend to me

   I even loved the ground that you walked on
   But that has been some time ago
   I could never take you back, no matter how I try
   For all the love I had is gone
You told me a lie and I believed you
That’s alright if that’s the way you want to do
Go on my dear now with your new love
You’ll know how it feels when he lies to you

Yesterday you said you loved me
Today you say it’s over now
Why did you go away and leave me
All the world is lonely now
Don’t tell me that you love another
And that you’ve broken every vow
For I don’t want to live without you
All the world is lonely now
I’ve tried so hard to make you happy
With love your heart would not allow
It’s hard to know you’ll never want me
All the world is lonely now
Goodbye, good luck and may God bless you
I’ll try to get along somehow
I know I’ll never love another
All the world is lonely now

When we were young and we thought we loved each other
But you didn’t love me I guess
For you’ve gone and you’ve found another
Everything to you is regret
   This morning along about daybreak
   You quarreled at me the whole night through
   I know it’s not too late for your sake dear
   But for me I will always be blue
Oh I’m weary my darling weary
Just to know your love’s gone cold
For without you life will be so dreary
We’ll need each other when we grow old
Oh sweetheart be good to our babies
And I want you to teach them to pray
Tell them to say a little prayer for their daddy
Where he will be no one can say

   Always be kind to your mother
   It’s the greatest gift you can give
   Obey and do what she tells you
   And pray that long here she may live
We all take mothers for granted
And do things that cause her much pain
I know for I lost my sweet mother
God took her from this world of sin
Please go to your mom while she’s living
And tell her you love her today
To her you’re always her baby
She loves you ’til death makes its claim

Always late with your kisses
Won’t you come to my arms sweet darlin’ and stay
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way? 
 How long do you think I can wait
When you know you’re always late
Always late with your kisses
Why oh why do you want to dome this way?

And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And as my trembling spirit fly
Unto a world unknown
And as my trembling spirit fly
Unto a world unknown
Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me
Eternal happiness far away
Must then my portion be
Eternal happiness far away
Must then my portion be
A land of deepest shade
Unpierced by human thought
That weary region of the dead
Where all things are forgot
That weary region of the dead
Where all things are forgot

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I’m found
Was blind but now I see.
‘Twas grace that taught my heert to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Then when we first begun

Far away in some deep mountain
Where the merry sunbeams play
There I wandered thru the clover
Singing to a village maid
    She was dearer than the dearest
    Ever loving kind and true
    And she wore beneath her bonnet
    Amber tresses tied in blue
Fact decreed that we parted
When the leaves of autumn fell
Then two hearts were separated
That had loved each other well
She was all I had to cherish
Every loving king and true
Now I see in every vision
Amber tresses tied in blue

Oh a ship out on the ocean just a speck against the sky
Amelia Earhart’s flight was set that day
With her partner Captain Noonan on the second of July
Her plane fell in the ocean far away
   There’s a beautiful beautiful field
   Far away in a land that is fair
   Happy landings to you Amelia Earhart
   Farewell first lady of the air
A half an hour later an s.o.s. was heard
The signal weak but still her voice was brave
In shark-infested waters her plane went down that night
In the blue Pacific to a watery grave.
Now you have heard my story of that awful tragedy
And prayed that she might fly on safe again
In years to come when others blaze a trail across the sky
We’ll never forget Amelia and her plane.

While strolling alone in the country
Reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin
So beautiful there to behold
A stranger was standing in silence
His eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him
For these were the words that it bore
In the sign read an old log cabin for sale
An old oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire each day
And a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple so patiently looked
For a boy who’s last promise did fail
Now the old rockin’ chairs will be rockin’ no more
There’s an old log cabin for sale
How long has it been since you’ve written
A letter to mother and dad
How long has it been since you’ve seen them
Oh why don’t you make their heart glad
Too soon will the old home be vacant
A candle light gleaming no more
Don’t wait ’til too late to remember
There may be a sign on the door
Many years an old couple so patiently looked
For a boy who’s last promise did fail
Now the old rockin’ chairs will be rockin’ no more
There’s an old log cabin for sale

Just like old times you were her last night
and gone were my sorrows and cares
Just like old times you were gone and I
Had dreamed of an old love affair
   I was alone in the darkness my dear
   Many dreams ago you left me there
   Sunlight told me you were gone and I
   Had dreamed of an old love affair
Nights are so empty since you’ve been gone
I loved you with all of my heart
Heaven was mine when you smiled last night
And said we could make a new start

Setting alone in an old rocking chair
I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who still care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
Her hands were all callused wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw here there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
Bless her old heart do you think she’d complain
Life has been bitter tho’ she’d live it again
And carry the cress that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
It wouldn’t take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody’s part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
I know some youngster’s in an old orphan’s home
Who’d think they owned Heaven if she was their own
They’d never be willing to let her sit there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

I’ve found a sweet haven of sunshine at last,
and Jesus abiding above,
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
and sweetly He tells His love
The tempest is o’er
(The danger, the tempest forever is o’er)
I’m safe evermore
(My anchor is holding I’m safe ever more)
What gladness what rapture is mine
The danger is past
(The water’s receding, the danger is past)
I’m anchored at last
(I’m feeling so happy I’m anchored at last)
I’m anchored in love divine
He saw me endangered and lovingly came
To pilot my storm-beaten soul
Sweet peace He has spoken and bless His dear name
The billows no longer roll
His love shall control me through life and in death
Completely I’ll trust to the end
I’ll praise Him each hour and my last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul’s Best Friend

   Anchored to the shore anchored to the shore
   All my tribulation will follow me no more
   Anchored to the shore anchored to the shore
   I was adrift but now I’m finely anchored to the shore.
Demands are placed upon me this much I will concede
For years I kept on running from an awful deed
By dwelling on this fortune in the hopes of yesterday
I kept myself confined and there is a better way
The storm will rage again some day of this we can be sure
A lifetime has its seasons and each we shall endure
There are no simple answers or solutions from on high
The challenge lies before us on ourselves we can rely.

My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph has begun
   Oh come angel band
   Come and around me stand
   Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
   To my immortal home
   Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
   To my immortal home
Oh bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Who’s blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
   Make me a poster of an old rodeo
   Just give me one thing one thing I can hold on to
   To believe in this livin’ just a hard way to go
I am an old man named after my father
Now lady is another child who’s grown old
If dreams were thunder and lightening was desire
This old house would have burned down a long time ago
When I was a young man now I was a cowboy
I weren’t much to look at but a free ramblin’ man
But that was a long time and no matter how much I try
Those years just flow by like a broken down dam.
There’s flies in the kitchen Lord I can hear’em buzzin’
Ain’t done nothin’ since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the mornin’
Come home in the evenin’ and have nothin’ to say?

Sweetheart I recall the day I first met you
I wonder if you remember the same
We talked of the love we shared for each other
And longed for the day we’d change your sweet name
   Oh, I can still hear your voice in the evening
   I see your sweet face your blue eyes so bright
   God took you away and left me so lonely
   The angels are singing in heaven tonight
As the years passed away we cherished each other
No worries or cares to darken our day
From our little home up in the Clinch Mountains
The savior came down and called you one day
I’ll always be true and love you, my darling
But I know you are happy and healthy up there
When God calls me home I’ll meet you in heaven
Please wait for me, darling, I’ll meet you up there

A house not a home was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he’d swear his voice cold and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gambling crowd
I’ve never seen my daddy inside a house of God
For Satan held his hand down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard my daddy praying til God made it right
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night

My heart is sad my soul is weary
While sailing oe’r life’s rugged plain
The clouds are dark the day is dreary
It seems 
   Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
   Bear me over the deep to heaven above
   When the shadows shall fall and the savior shall call
   Angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
There is no earthly friend to guide me
No one to call to heaven’s goal
But Christ the savior stands beside me
To cheer and comfort my poor soul
At last the harbor I am nearing
I see the lights along the shore
I hear my friends and loved ones cheering
I’ll soon be safe for ever more

They stood on the beach one evening
Out in the moonlight so fair
Was a boy in the prime of manhood
And a girl of beauty rare
Oh I never thought that you loved me
An innocent look of surprise
Came out from beneath her lashes
And into her deep brown eyes
    Oh sir I was only flirting
    Only a playing a part
    Just another boy’s life ruined
    Just another broken heart
Sir, I’m to be married this winter
Farewell as she gave me her hand
And throwing a robe around her
She left me alone on the sand
Now he goes where the crowd all passes
Always so bitter and cold
Just another boy’s life ruined
Just another boy grown old
There’s a rose grows in your garden
White roses the emblem of peace
And when I am dead, little darlin’
Plant that rose at my head and my feet

Another day how can I stand it
Without my ba-by by my side
This empty fee-lin’ now inside
Is bound to show what I can’t hide
   Just make mine straight without a chaser
   And let me drown my blues this way
   My darlin’s gone my life is empty
   Nothing to live for another day
A thief could rob and take my money
If death was pending I could pray
I’m helpless now what will my fate be
As the hours drag by another day

Another day another dollar
that’s what I’m workin’ for today
Another day another dollar
sure can’t buy my blues away
   Another Day Another Dollar
   Sure can’t buy my blues away
I’m just tryin’ to make a livin’
Workin’ jobs that I enjoy
But it ain’t easy findin’ somethin’
For this lonesome hearted boy
Now my life is like a highway
Just too many roads to take
You know I’ll try to take the right one
Just gets harder every day

The wind is blowing ’round the cabin
I hate to hear that lonesome sound
I’m all alone and so down hearted
Since my true love she ain’t around
   I hate to see the sun a sinking
   Another night to toss and turn
   Another night to dream about her
   Another night for her I yearn
She had no cause to go and leave me
For I had never done her wrong
She left our home and little children
And with another she has gone
The children they are soundly sleeping
No they don’t know that their mother’s gone
What can I do when they awaken
I can’t tell them that their mother’s wrong

One by one they’re turnin’ out the lights
I keep feedin’ that ol’ jukebox just to hold you tight
I guess it’s for the best I just put in my last dime
I heard you whisper we’d meet again
Another place another time
   Won’t that room of mine be a lonely place to be
   After I’ve been holdin’ you so close to me
   Won’t that ol’ stairway be a little hard to climb
   To a lonely room to wait for
   Another place another time
Chairs are stacked on the tables and it’s closing time
They say I could wait right here forever
If they’d only let me stay
Any place would be much better
Than that ol’ lonely room of mine
And a sleepless night awaitin’ for
Another place another time

   It’s another Saturday night
   I’m gonna make the same ol’ rounds
   Put my money in the juke box
   in the honky-tonk down town
I’ve been a working all week long
and ain’t nothin’ that’s gone right
I got a payday In my pocket
It’s another Saturday night.
With a pretty girl in my arms
and a lonesome juke box song
I never think of Monday morning
till that Saturday night is gone
Pretty Mama’s there for me
and I’m gonna motor time
I’m like a wound up clock on Friday
I got to run down Saturday night
It’s another Saturday night
I’m gonna make the same ol’ rounds
Put my money in the juke box
In the honky-tonk down town
And when my money’s spent and gone
tell me something it’s all right
I’ll have a rough one Monday morning
but it’s been a knockdown Saturday night.

My love is dead and buried yonder
Beneath the weeping willow tree
What wrecks my life and makes me wonder
Is because she died for me
   Then lay me down in death beside her
   For she’s all this life to me
   That I may join and e’er caress her
   In a land beyond the sea
Yes she died before I told her
That I loved her true and kind
And that I did not mean to fool her
But she left me to repine
God shall I ever get forgiveness
For the deeds that I have done
And meet up yonder her sweet charming
For I know she did me some

Anywhere the wind blows
thats the way your heart goes
There is no warmth or fireside glow
to keep your love at home
Seems like anybody knows
enough to keep your loved ones home
yet you’re still a rolling stone
spending too much time alone
Those lovers living far away
only hear the words you want to say
They don’t make you get inside that place
you kept locked up for so long
what if someone thanks you everyday
took the best and worst and still she stayed
would you tend that garden come what may
or would you still find something wrong
Anyway…..
If absence makes your heart grow fonder
maybe even more you’ll want to wander
’cause time stands still when you’re around her
and the real world rushes in
but if absence makes your heart grow colder
then you’re gonna cry on my shoulder
and think of things you might have told her
and sweet things that might have been
Anyway..…

At the east end of town At the foot of a hill
There’s a chimney so tall That says “Aragon Mill”
But there’s no smoke at all Comin’ out of the stack
For the mill has pulled out And they ain’t comin’ back 
   And the only sound I hear is the sound of the wind
   As it blows through the town, weave and spin, weave and spin. 
There’s no children at all In the narrow, empty streets
Since the looms have all gone It’s so quiet I can’t sleep.
Now I’m too old to change And I’m too young to die
And there’s no place to go For my woman and I. 
Now the mill has closed down It’s the only sound I know
Tell me where will I go? Tell me where will I go?

Are you a stranger to God
Carried away with your pride
Tell me sinner did you ever stop to think
Are you afraid to die 
   Are you afraid
   Are you unsaved
   Are you afraid to die 
Call on him while he’s near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek him where he may be found
Are you afraid to die 
Are you too wicked to cry
Would you to God’s bosom fly
Soon he’s coming like a thief in the night
Are you afraid to die

How often I think of the old days
I remember well the love we once knew
We parted now and strayed from each other
But somehow I can’t help wondering about you
   
    Are you alone with a memory
    Haunted by dreams of the past
    Just waiting for someone to tell you
    You’re playing a game that won’t last
Last night I was dreamin about you
I thought you were back here with me
I prayed that you’d stay here forever
Too soon I realized it couldn’t be
Someday when your love here is faded
And we meet on that highway with no end
We’ll stroll hand in hand there forever
In a land where our love can bloom again

My days and nights are lonely darling since you left and went away
I still recall those unkind words that were said that day
It hurts me so to know you’re leaving I realize that I’m to blame
Believe me darling I’ll do better just the same.
   Then come on back and let’s begin our love anew
   Deep down inside there’s still a loneliness for you
   Those unkind words were spoken dear we will just let them be
   Please tell me darling are you coming back to me?
Each night I go to bed the dreams I dream my dear are all of you
How I just love to gaze into your eyes of blue
There’ll never be another sweetheart that can take the place of you
Tell me you still care for me dear please do.

Hello there stranger how do you do
there’s something I’d like to say to you
You seem surprised I recognize
I’m no detective but I just surmise
You’re from the place I’m longing to be
your smiling face seems to say to me
You’re from my homeland my sunny homeland
tell me can it be?
   Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie where the fields of cotton beckon to me
   I’m glad to see you tell me I’ll be you and the friend I’m longing to see
   Are you from Alabama Tennessee or Caroline
   Any place below the Mason Dixon Line
   Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie ’cause I’m from Dixie too.
It was a way back in old ’89
When first I crossed that Mason Dixon Line
Gee but again I long to return
To those good old folks I left behind
My home was way down in old Alabam’
On the plantation near Birmingham
and there’s one thing certain I’m surely flirtin’
With those southbound trains

Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me I say?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memories cling to that bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Like the rose on the vine I am clinging to you
As I did when we drifted apart
I am wishing you back to that little shack
Where I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Does the chair in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you miss me and wish I was there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, darling, are you lonesome tonight?
I have counted the days, I’ve counted the nights
I’ve counted the months and the years
I have counted on you since we drifted apart
Tell me, darling, are you lonesome tonight?

The day that I kissed you and told you goodbye
Your lips told me that you would wait
But your lips deceived me and told me a lie
While your heart was sealing my fate
   Are you all alone
   With a memory?
   Now that I am gone
   Darling, are you missing me?
Out of the clear sky a letter then came
And just like a bolt from the blue
My castles came tumbling a I read it o’er
I still can’t believe that it’s true
It said that in spite of the vows you had made
The glitter of gold turns your head.
And while I was trying employment to find
You married another instead

When we’re all alone and I’m in your arms
Are you teasing me
When you’re tellin’ me how you thrill to my charms
Are you teasing me
    Are you untrue when I’m not with you
    When we’re apart are you free
    Tell me darling while our love is still young
    Are you teasing me
You say that my kiss sends your heart in a whirl
Are you teasing me
And that youll be mine till the end of the world
Are you teasing me
You tell me my love could make your life complete
Are you teasing me
And n’ere from my arms would you long to be free
Are you teasing me

When we’re all alone and I’m in your arms
Are you teasing me
When you’re tellin’ me how you thrill to my charms
Are you teasing me?
    Are you untrue when I’m not with you
   When we’re apart are you free
   Tell me dariing while our love is still young
   Are you teasing me?
You say that my kiss sends your heart in a whirl
Are you teasing me
And that youll be mine till the end of the world
Are you teasing me?

Are you tired of me my darling
Did you mean those words you said
When you spoke in fond affection
On the day that we were wed
   Tell me could you live life over
   Would you make it otherwise
   Are you tired of me my darling
   Answer only with your eyes
Did you ever rue the springtime
When we first each other met
And you told me that you’d love me
Words my heart can n’er forget

   Are you waiting just for me my darling
   While I’m far across the deep blue sea
   Or have you found someone else my darling
   Please tell me are you waiting just for me
While I’m writing you tonight my darling
There’s such a burning deep within my breast
I know you promised that you would be faithful
Well tell me honey have you stood the test
You’ve never given me a cause to doubt you
You have always been so true and kind
But my spirits keep on sinking lower
Fearing that a new love you will find

Have you been to Jesus for His cleansing power
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you trusting in His grace this hour
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
   Are you washed (are you washed) in the blood (in the blood)
   In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb
   Are your garments spotless are they white as snow
   Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you walking daily by your Saviour’s side
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Do you rest each moment in the crucified
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Lay aside these garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb
There’s a fountain Flowing for the soul unclean
Oh be washed in the blood of the Lamb.

Oh once upon a time in Arkansas
An old man sat in his little cabin door
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
A jolly old tune that he played by ear
   It was raining hard but the fiddler didn’t care
   He sawed away at the popular air
   Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
   That didn’t seem to bother the old man at all
A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn’t seem to fret
So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
You’d better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn’t mend it now it’s a rainy day
The traveler replied that’s all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it’s good and tight
   But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
   And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
   Get along said he for you give me a pain
   My cabin never leaks when it doesn’t rain

   As long as I live ( As long as I live )
   If it be one hour ( If it be one hour )
   Or if it be ( or if it be ) one hundred years
   I’ll keep remembering ( I’ll keep remembering )
   For ever and ever ( For ever and ever )
   I love you dear ( I love you dear )
   As long as I live
It’s over you said that night you left me
That we’d forget that we’d ever met
I haven’t forgotten I wonder if you have
Or is your heart to full of regret
I never thought that night you left me
That life alone could be so sad
It may sound funny but I’ll never forget you
You’re the only joy that I ever had

   Ashes of love cold as ice
   You made the debt and I’ll pay the price
   Our love is gone there’s no doubt
   Ashes of love the flame burned out
The love light that gleamed in your eyes
Has gone out to my surprise
We said goodbye my heart bled
I can’t revive our love, it’s dead
I trusted dear our love would stand
Your every wish was my command
My heart tells me I must forget
I loved you then I love yet

At the end of a long lonely day without you
My world seems to fall on it’s face
Well, I’m alright through the day but the day fades away
At the end of a long lonely day
   Another day wishing you were here
   I dread each lonely night Lord their filled with tears
   Oh how I’ve cried yes I’ve cried and these tears I can’t hide
   At the end of a long lonely day
At the end of the day I go back to my room
And watch as the sun fades away
And the loneliness there with its grief and despair
At the end of a long lonely day

In the sky the bright stars glittered
On the bank the pale moon shone
And ’twas from aunt Dinah’s quilting party
I was seeing Nellie home
   I was seeing Nellie home
   I was seeing Nellie home
   And ’twas from aunt Dinah’s quilting party
   I was seeing Nellie home
On my arm a soft hand rested
Rested like as ocean foam
And ’twas from aunt Dinah’s quilting party
I was seeing Nellie home
On my lips a whisper trembled
Trembled till it dared to come
And ’twas from aunt Dinah’s quilting party
I was seeing Nellie home
On my life new hopes were dawning
And those hopes have lived and grown
And ’twas from aunt Dinah’s quilting party
I was seeing Nellie home

Tonight I’m dreaming of Avery County
Where the cool mountain breezes blow
O’er the laurels and rhododendrons
And my sweet Avery County Rose
I can hear the old folks singing
While the fiddles softly play
I can hear that banjo ringing
Thru the valley at close of day
The fragrance of the flowers
Fill the air with sweet perfume
As my sweetheart walked beside me
Neath that Avery County moon

One day on a bright April morning
As the sun stretched over the sky
Stood a man with his hands tied behind him
Awaiting his sentence to die
The birds hushed their singing at daybreak
For Christ had his place to fulfill
From a lovely bright mansion in Heaven
To away on a lonely dark hill
They made him walk that Calvary
He had to drink the bitter cup
One could hear hammers ring in the stillness
Then the soldiers they lifted him up

Away out on the old saint Sabbath
Lay down to take my rest
My knapsack for my pillow
And my gun upon my chest
   Please don’t bury me on the lonesome prairie
   Please don’t bury me on the lone prairie
   You can bury me in the east
   You can bury me in the west
   Please don’t bury me on the lone prairie
My father he lies sleeping
Beneath the deep blue sea
I have no father no mother
There’s none but hell and me
My mother she lies sleeping
Beneath the church yard rocks
Her body lies there moldering
And her spirit has gone to God

I wonder if I’ll ever forget you
And if our love that’s true ever dies
I can’t forget the kisses you gave me
Or memories of your two baby blue eyes
   I’ll always keep a memory of you
   Visions of eyes as blue as the sky
   And that’s why each night there’s tears on my pillow
   I’m dreaming of your two baby blue eyes
Now when day is done and shadows are fallen’
My love will sleep ’til morning sunrise
I lay awake just tossing and turning
I’m longing for dreams of baby blue eyes
Now day after day try to keep smiling
And a broken heart I try to disguise
Now night after night my lonely heart’s calling
It’s calling for you my baby blue eyes

   Little girl ( little girl ) baby girl
   She’s my darling little precious baby girl
   Like an angel to me and I know that he
   Sent from Heaven my little baby girl
She’s as sweet as the flowers of springtime
Her blue eyes they sparkle so bright
Just a touch of her little baby hand
Seems to guide my weary footsteps day and night
How those two little arms try to hold me
Her little heart’s a blessing to our home
And at night when I’m far far away
As dream of her I’m never all alone

If you’re lovin’ me like I’m lovin’ you
then baby we’re really in love
If you’re happy with me like I’m happy with you
old cupid just gave us a shove
If you’re thinkin’ of me like I’m thinkin’ of you
then I know what you’re thinkin’ of
If you’re lovin’ me like I’m lovin’ you
then baby we’re really in love.
I run around in circles and turn in fire alarms
I’m nutty as a fruit cake when you’re not in my arms
If you’re meant for me like I’m meant for you
baby we fit like a glove
If you’re lovin’ me like I’m lovin’ you
then baby we’re really in love.
If you’re lovin’ me like I’m lovin’ you
then baby we’re really in love
If you’re countin’ on me like I’m countin’ on you
old cupid just give us a shove
If you’re dreamin’ of me like I’m dreamin’ of you
then I know what you’re dreamin’ of
If you’re lovin’ me like I’m lovin’ you
then baby we’re really in love.
Now folks think I’ve gone crazy
and I don’t feel too sure
And yet there’s nothin’ wrong with me
that weddin’ bells won’t cure
If you go for me like I go for you
baby we fit like a glove
If you’re lovin’ me like I’m lovin’ you
then baby we’re really in love.

I’m back in the saddle again
Out where a friend is a friend
Where the long-horn cattle feed
On the lowly jimson weed
I’m back in the saddle again.
Ridin’ the range once more
Totin’ my old forty-four
Where you sleep out every night
Where the only law is right
I’m back in the saddle again.
   Whoop-pi-ti-yi-yo
   Rockin’ to and fro
   Back in the saddle again
   Whoop-pi-ti-yi-yay
   I go my own way
   Back in the saddle again.

I’m goin’ down to the Cumberland River
In the state of Tennessee
Gonna walk the ground where I spent my childhood
I’m goin’ back back to Dixie.
I spent my life a foot loose drifter
Like a gypsy is I’m a travelin’ man
Can’t find no place where I’m contented
Can’t find no folks I understand
Ain’t got no wife ain’t got no family
At least that is I know about
And if I should die right where I’m standing
No one would know that I’ve checked out
Come drink my wine and take my coffee
You can have my beans they’re in the can
I’m gonna go back to where I started
Gonna end my life a happy man.

   Now it’s back to the barrooms
   Right back to drinkin’ again
   Maybe someday you’ll love me enough to stay with me
   And whisky won’t be my best friend
   Now it’s back to the barrooms again
Now the bartender knows me, he knows how you do me
And he knows why I’m back here again
He must be given a prize for his patience
For bartenders do understand
Now it’s back to the barrooms again
With the loud music roarin’, the bartender pourin’
My shaky legs tryin’ to stand
It’s over and over I’ve tried to stay sober
But, look what a failure I’ve been
Now it’s back to the barrooms again

I’m out on the sea filled with sorrows
Tossed like a ship who ran ashore
I’m seeking the help of my saviour
By the way of the cross I must go
Back to the cross and to Jesus
Back to the cross I am called
I’ve drifted too far and I’ve wandered
From the saviour that once was my home
The sins of this world have overcome me
Have pushed and left me to roam
So I’m going to back to my saviour
Back to the cross and home
The joy of these life are too fleeting
And wrapped in troubles around
I’ve lost the church of the stranger
I’ve drifted too far from home

I hear that train a comin’
Comin’ down the line
Gonna meet you at the station
Gonna see that gal of mine
    Bald Knob Arkansas see my Linda Lou
    I will be her lovin’ man and always lover her true
    Til I’m bald headed too
I’m awful tired and hungry now
Got nothin’ in my craw
I’m on my way back to see my girl
Back in Bald Knob Arkansas
Got a blue eyed girl a waiting there
Sweetest I’d ever saw
Well I’m on my way to make her mine
Back in Bald Knob Arkansas

Come and listen to a story ’bout a man named Jed
Poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed
Then one day he was shooting for some food,
And up through the ground come a bubbling crude
(Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea)
Well the first thing you know old Jed’s a millionaire
Kin folk said Jed move away from there
Said California is the place you oughta be
So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(Hills that is, swimming pools, movie stars)
Well now it’s time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You’re all invited back again to this locality
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
(Beverly Hillbillies, that’s what they call ’em now,
Nice folks Y’all come back now, ya hear?)

Well me and my horse Balo we’re going to the fair
We’re gonna ride the bucks and run the barrels see everything that’s there
We’re gonna wink at all the women flag a tail at all the mares
We’ll be hellbent for leather when we go to the fair
We’re gonna shave and brush and shower shine our shoes up good and bright
We’re gonna strap on all our leather stuff and cinch it up real tight
We’re gonna jog around the warm up ring and lean against the rail
And check out all that horsy stuff like eyes and legs and tails
We’re gonna jog in to the show ring with our head set good and proud
When the announcer calls the names out we hope he does it good and loud
We’re gonna win us a blue ribbon and show off for the crowd
Well I guess we’ll bring the stands down when Balo takes his bow
We’re gonna strut around the grand stand and down the old midway
I’ll be munchin’ popcorn while Balo’s chompin’ hay
We’re gonne find ourselves a saddle with something cute on either side
And me and my horse Balo might just join ’em for a ride

I asked my love to take a walk
Just a walk a little way
And as we walk, oh, may we talk
All about our wedding day 
   Only say that you’ll be mine
   In our home we’ll happy be
   Down beside where the waters flow
   On the banks of the Ohio 
I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She said Willie, don’t you murder me
I’m unprepared for eternity 
I took her by her lily white hand
And dragged her down that bank of sand
There I throwed her in to drown
I watched her as she floated down 
Was walking home tween twelve and one
Thinkin’ of what I had done
I killed a girl, my love you see
Because she would not marry me 
The very next morn about half past four
The Sheriff came knocked at my door
He said now young man come now and go
Down to the Banks of the Ohio

I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk a little ways
And as we walked along we talked
All about our wedding day
   Only say that you’ll be mine
   In no others arms entwined
   Down beside where the waters flow
   On the banks of the Ohio
I took her by her lily white hand
I dragged her down that bank of sand
There I threw her in to drown
I watched her as she floated down
Returning home between twelve and one
Thinking of what a deed I’d done
I’d killed the girl I loved you see
Because she would not marry me
The very next day about half passed four
The sheriff’s men knocked at my door
He said young man come now and go
Down to the banks of the Ohio

In London town where I was born
There lived a fair maid dwellin’
Made every youth cry well away
And her name was Barbara Allen
I sent a servant to your town
Where Barbara she was dwellin’
My master sent and he sent for you
If your name is Barbara Allen
T’was in the merry month of May
When all the flowers were a-bloomin’
A young man on his death bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen
Oh Nellie Mae on her way home
Were the words so sweet love singin’
And as they sang they seemed to say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen
Oh the more she ran oh the more she mourned
‘Till she could not stop her cyin’
Oh pick me up and take me home
For I am surely a-dyin’
Oh father my father go dig my grave
Go dig it long and narrow
Sweet William died for me today
So I’ll die for him tomorrow
Oh they buried her in the old churchyard
Buried sweet William down beside her
On William’s grave grew a red red rose
On Barbara’s grew a great briar
Oh it grew to the top of the old churchyard
It grew till It could not grow no higher
And there they tied in a true love’s knot
The red red rose ’round the briar

In scarlet Town where I was born
There was a fair maid dwelling
Made many a youth cry well a day
Her name was Barbara Allen
It was in the merry month of May
When green buds they were swelling
Sweet William came from the west country
And he courted Barbara Allen
He sent his servant unto her
To the place where she was dwelling
Said my master’s sick, bids me call for you
If your name be Barbara Allen
Well, slowly, slowly got she up
And slowly went she nigh him
But all she said as she passed his bed
Young man I think you’re dying
Then lightly tripped she down the stairs
She heard those church bells tolling
And each bell seemed to say as it tolled
Hard hearted Barbara Allen
O, mother, mother go make my bed
And make it long and narrow
Sweet William died for me today
I’ll die for him tomorrow
They buried Barbara in the old church yard
They buried Sweet William beside her
Out of his grave grew a red, red rose
And out of hers a briar
They grew and grew up the old church wall
Till they could grow no higher
And at the top twined a lover’s knot
The red rose and the briar

Redheaded pecker sittin’ on a limb
Ma Chicken Nellie got a hen
Wrung his neck and plucked him clean
Funniest chicken you ever seen
   Hey Barefoot Nellie
   Ho Barefoot Nellie
   Hey Barefoot Nellie
   You’re the one for me.
Nellie went to town one day
Ridin’ on a load of hay
Sold a man a trip to Mars
And now she sits behind the bars.
Nell put on her Sunday dress
Most of it was lookin’ best
Made out of an old feed sack
Poppy wrote right on the back.

Oh the night came undone like a party dress
And fell at her feet in a beautiful mess
The smoke and the whiskey came home in her curls
And they crept through the dreams of the barroom girls
Well she tosses and turns because the sun is unkind
And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
But leave all the blue skies for the rest of the world
Because the neon will shine for the barroom girls
   Oh the barroom girls go by your side
   Like the ponies who pass on a carousel ride
   And all of the colors go ‘round in a swirl
   When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls
Now she rolls to her feet when she can’t sleep no more
And looks at her clothes lying out on the floor
Last night’s spangles and yesterday’s pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls
Last night’s spangles and yesterday’s pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls

In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississipp’
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans
   We fired our guns and the British kept a coming
   There wasn’t nigh as many as there was a while ago
   We fired once more and they began to running
   Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We looked down the river and we seen the British come
And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
We stood behind our cotton bales and didn’t say a thing
Old Hickory said we could take ’em by suprise
If we didn’t fire a musket ’til we looked ’em in the eyes
We held our fire ’til we seen their faces well
We opened up our squirrel guns and really gave ’em
Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where the rabbits couldn’t go
They ran so fast the hounds couldn’t catch ’em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We fired our cannon ’til the barrel melted down
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

Be good to my little baby girl
She’s all I got left in this old world
She’s warm and she’s sweet
Lord she means the world to me
Be good to my little baby girl.
Her eyes light up when I mention your name
Lately she smiles all the time
She needs someone strong who won’t do her wrong
I’m hoping that you’ll be the kind.
I can see her as a child sittin’ on her mama’s knee
Sometimes I think I failed her back then
‘Cause I was runnin’ wild I was always runnin”round
I never was the dad I should have been.
She told you of her past of the ones that done her wrong
You know her heart’s been broken in two
She deserves some happiness and she thinks you’re the best
I believe her so I’m counting on you.

Be honest with me dear whatever you do
Remember you’re mine dear so always be true
Wherever you wander on land or on sea
If you really love me be honest with me
My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear I’ll dream about you
Oh you are my darlin’ you’re all that I see
If you really love me be honest with me
Some day I’ll return dear and make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I’m all alone
I’ll never forget dear your sweet memory
If you really love me be honest with me

Lay down that cane and start moving
While you can get out of your chair
Put on those shoes and start walkin’
Be proud of the gray in your hair.
Well I hope you see what I’m sayin’
Einstien could very well be right
That man’s greatest victory is dyin’
Don’t never give up without a fight
Said you know how it feels to be lonesome
You know what it means when you’re blue
There ain’t no use to sit and worry
For there ain’t nobody worryin’ about you.

   Be true to yourself little darlin’
   Life is short don’t live it in regret
   If you’re not happy here go find another
   And I’ll pretend that we had never met
I watched, I wondered why you’ve grown so quiet
Deep in thought you seem so far away
Say, have you changed your mind about our future
Don’t lead me on if you don’t want to stay
Don’t be a fool and think you’ll learn to love me
If you don’t have those feelings for me now
Look deep inside your heart and answer truly
Am I the one you just can’t live without

Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down
Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down
It makes me feel like I’m on my last go-’round,
The water on Bear Creek, it tastes like cherry wine
The water on Bear Creek, it tastes like cherry wine
You take one drink of it, you’re drinking it all the time
If you stay on Bear Creek, you’ll get like Jesse James
If you stay on Bear Creek, you’ll get like Jesse James
You’ll take two old pistols
and hold up that Bear Creek train
I’m going high, high up on some lonesome hill
I’m going high, high up on some lonesome hill
Look down on Bear Creek where my good gal used to live

Beautiful beautiful brown eyes
Beautiful beautiful brown eyes
Beautiful beautiful brown eyes
I’ll never love blue eyes again.
Last night I staggered in the bar room
Fell right down on the floor
These were the words that I uttered
I’ll never get drunk anymore.
Oh Willie oh Willie I love you
Love you with all of my heart
Tomorrow we were to be married
But liquor has kept us apart.
For seven long years I’ve been married
Wish I was single again
A girl doesn’t know half her troubles
Until she has married a man.

For pleasure I went walking out through the fields one day
I started gathering flowers to make a sweet bouquet
Each flower that I gathered. each one played a part
Each flower stood for someone held dear to my heart 
   Beautiful bouquet I’m gathering today
   Picking the colours that’ll never fade away
   Each flower has a meaning so dear to me
   Each flower is a treasure chestof sweet memories 
Violets for my sweetheart, a white rose for my dad
A red rose stood for mother, the best friend that I had
Forget-me-nots stood faithfully for tried true friends of mine
Daisies for the puppy loves that I left far behind 
Lilies are for grandma, who watches from afar
Poppies are for brother, who lost his life at war
I put them all together, tomake a sweet bouquet
A rainbow full of colours that will never fade away

There’s a beautiful home far over the sea
With mansions of bliss for you and for me
A beautiful home so wondrously fair
That the savior for me has gone to prepare
   There’s a beautiful home (a beautiful home)
   far over the sea (far over the sea)
   There’s a beautiful home (a beautiful home)
   for you and for me (for you and for me)
   Its glittering powers (its glittering powers)
   of sun out shine (of sun out shine)
   That beautiful home (that beautiful home)
   someday shall be mine (someday shall be mine)
In that beautiful home a crown I shall wear
With the glorified throng their stories to share
But the doors of that home can never be known
Til the savior we see upon His white throne

I will not be your sweetheart
I’ll tell you the reason why
My mother always told me
To pass a drunkard by
   Beautiful isle o’er the sea
   Beautiful isle o’er the sea
   Beautiful isle o’er the sea
   There’s someone waiting for me
Now young man I will tell you
If you want my heart my hand
You better quit your drinking
And be a sober man
Go prove yourself be faithful
Go prove yourself be true
And sometime in the future
Perhaps I’ll marry you

There’s a beautiful moon shining down on Kentucky
Where the fields of bluegrass are growin’
‘Neath the beautiful moon shining down on Kentucky
Tomorrow that’s where I’ll be going
For the girl that I love she waits for me know
To return from ol’ sunny Tennessee
‘Neath the beautiful moon shining down on Kentucky
Tomorrow that’s where I will be
Well I left my old home way down in Kentucky
And headed for old sunny Tennessee
But I’m on my way back to the hills of Kentucky
With my darling once more there I’ll be

Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on. 
   Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem      (Star of Bethlehem)
   Shine upon us until the glory dawns.
   Give us a light to guide the way
   Unto the land of perfect day
   Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on (shine on) 
Oh Beautiful Star the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains till the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on (shine on) 
Oh Beautiful Star the hope of rest
For the redeemed the good and blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine
Oh Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on (shine on)

One day I met the beauty of my dreams
Pretty eyes she had you ought-a seen
Brown hair that flowed down behind
I saw it all and yet I was so blind
We wound up in her part of town
Bright lights with our music all around
I gazed into her eyes and she in mine
She had me in a trance it was so fine
Now I cry cry cry
I can’t get over her though I try
I’m blue blue blue
I should have known she never could be true
Well I find as the night has faded on
I found your house the neighbors say your gone
The girl she don’t live here anymore
Oh the pain to me that lies in store
So all I have is a picture in a frame
She disappeared the same way she came
She made a wreck of me and I find
She’s out of sight but always on my mind

Two old friends shared a room in a home for the elderly
Confined to their beds their bodies giving way
Old Joe lay by the window and watched the day go by
And Bill lived to hear him tell about the world outside
They shared with each other the stories of their lives
And relived all their memories and dreams of a better time
Outside the leaves were changing, summer turned to fall
And from the bed by the window old Joe described it all
   From, the bed by the window he’d tell how the children played
   The lovers in the park, the ducks out on the lake
   The little boy swept the sidewalk when the sun came up each day
   From the bed by the window he told it just that way
On a cold winter morning in the light of the dawn
The bed by the window was empty old Joe had passed and gone
They moved Bill by the window he couldn’t hold back the tears
He’d finally see the view outside after all these years
   From the bed by the window he couldn’t see out at all
   There was nothing out that window but an old brick wall
A new friend shares a room in a home for the elderly
Confined to his bed his body has given way
Now Bill lay by the window as the days go by
And his new friend left to hear him tell about the world outside
   From, the bed by the window he’d tell how the children played
   The lovers in the park, the ducks out on the lake
   The little boy swept the sidewalk when the sun came up each day
   From the bed by the window he told it just that way
Two old friends shared a room in a home for the elderly

Make me a bed right down on your floor
Make me a bed right down on your floor
I’ll lay my head in a bed on your floor
I’m a poor lonesome boy
I’m a long way from home
I’m a poor lonesome boy
I’m a long way from home
I’ll lay my head in a bed on your floor
The sheriff’s on my trail with a big forty-four
The sheriff’s on my trail with a big forty-four
I’ll lay my head in a bed on your floor
Clock strikin’ midnight and daylight to go
Clock strikin’ midnight and daylight to go
I’ll lay my head in a bed on your floor
Bed on the floor love bed on the floor
Make me a bed right down on your floor
I’ll lay my head in a bed on your floor

Workin’ on the new railroad mud up to my knees
Workin’ on the new railroad mud up to my knees
Workin’ for ol’ John Henry he’s mighty hard to please
I been all ’round this world.
Hang me oh hang me till I’m dead and gone
Hang me oh hang me till I’m dead and gone
Don’t care much ’bout dyin’ it’s bein’ in jail so long
I been all ’round this worId.
Mama and papa and baby sister makes three
Mama and papa and baby sister makes three
Marchin’ me to the gallows that’ll be the end of me
I been all ’round this world.
Up on Blueridge Mountain there I’ll make a stand
Up on Blueridge Mountain there I’ll make a stand
Rifle on my shoulder six shooter in my hand
I been all ’round this world.
If you see a rich girl send her on down the line
If you see a rich girl send her on down the line
If you see a poor girl I’ll bet she’s a friend of mine
I been all ’round this world.

I thought I’d seen pretty girls in my time
That was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
That was before I met you 
   I thought I was swinging the world by its tail
   I thought I could never be blue
   I thought I’d been kissed and I thought I’d been loved
   That was before I met you 
I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
I never saw one that could ever hold me
That was before I met you 
They say a man must reap what he’s sown
Darlin’, I hope that’s not true
For once I made plans of living alone
But that was before I met you

The weather finally broke in the middle of april
Jacob loaded up his wagon with last years furs.
He’d have to make the trip alone ’cause it would be too risky
For his pretty wife sarah and the unborn child she carried with her.
It took three weeks to reach the mississippi ribbon
And he turned south toward new orleans
For a boy from the mountains it was easy to get caught up
In the sights and sounds of the city
And the things he’d never seen.
   And the river rolls on Like an endless river
   The sun light glistens on the rocks below
   He can hear her voice in the rippling water
   Saying please be home before the cold winds blow.
He fell in With a bad companion
Said give me your money or I’ll take your life
Jacob drew his pistol and in less than a heart beat
The stranger lay dead on the floor and someone had to pay the price.
And after three long years in a Louisiana prison
He stands on the hill that overlooks his farm
With his woman by his side thanks god for his blessings
And most of all for the blonde hair child resting in his arms.

Well pack up your car go on and leave
and tell your folks that we are through
Honey that ain’t going to make me grieve
cause I know just what you’ll do
You’ll pout and cry and swear that I
am the meanest man in town
But I’ll bet money that you’ll be back
before the sun goes down
   Before the sun goes down you’ll be all ready for some lovin’
   You’ll run to your daddy for some kissin’ and huggin’
   And I’ll be waitin’ around
   For I know you’ll be home before the sun goes down
Honey there ain’t nothing else in the book that you ain’t said
All kinds of names and low down things
I’ve heard them all from A to Z
And when you’ve had your say you’ll up and run away and swear you’re leavin’ town
But you’ll cool off come a draggin’ it back before the sun goes down

You’re wanting to be free i know that you don’t love me
But let me hold you close before you go
I won’t let the teardrops fall until your steps are down the hall
But let me hold you close before you go
Before you go and say goodbye, let your heart beat with mine
This memory I’ll have of you while I’m alone
Let the time cease to be these last moments you’re with me
But let me hold you close before you go
All the pain will come soon, loneliness will fill the room
But let me hold you close before you go
My heart is breaking in two there’s nothing left I’m losing you
But let me hold you close before you go

Behind these prison walls of love dear
Forever more I know I’ll be
Condemned because you love another
No one will ever set me free
   In my heart sweet memories linger
   Of the days when you were mine
   Behind these prison walls of love dear
   Visions of a past entwined
I know my love for you seems strange dear
But it’s all I’ll ever know
I’ll content myself with mem’ries
If it pleases you to go
   Just remember precious darling
   When we face the judge above
   All of our vows will be unbroken
   Behind these prison walls of love
   Behind these prison walls of love

Behind these prison walls of love dear
Forever more I know I’ll be
Condemned because you love another
No one will ever set me free
   In my heart sweet memories linger
   Of the days when you were mine
   Behind these prison walls of love dear
   Visions of a past entwined
I know my love for you seems strange dear
But it’s all I’ll ever know
I’ll content myself with memories
If it pleases you to go
   Just remember precious darling
   When we face the judge above
   All of our vows will be unbroken
   Behind these prison walls of love

Twas in St Louis city where I first saw the light
Brought up by honest parents on a pathway of right
I was left on orphan at the age of ten years
On mother’s grave I shed many tears
I’d scarcely reached manhood when I left my old home
With some other fellows to the west we did roam
Seeking employment though scarcely could find
We seemed so poor and the people unkind
Was in New York City where we first met our fate
We were arrested while roaming the streets
The charges were burglars the theft it was called
But they said it would place us behind the stone walls
We were marched next morning to the courthouse for trial
My pal was downhearted so I gave him a smile
We pleaded for mercy but was shown none at all
They gave us twenty years behind the stone walls
We were handcuffed next morning and marched to the pen
We arrived there at midnight with a few other men
The doors were thrown open we marched in the halls
Just learn to be a convict behind the stone walls
While lying that night on a pallet of straw
I swore I would never again break the law
There’s none but your mother to bear your downfall
When you are a convict behind the stone walls
Come all you young fellows and listen to me
When you lose life’s pleasures you’ve lost liberty
I’ve tasted life’s pleasures it’s bitter than gall
It’ll lead to a cell behind the stone wall

I’ll tell you all a story that I think you’ll understand
Travelin’ thru Georgia ramblin’ across the land
I passed the Bellville depot and something said to me
Stop here son there’s something you should see
I stopped a while and rested on the depot steps
The tall pines wavin’ in the breeze the air was clear and fresh
That Georgia winter sunshine was warmin’up my back
And I saw the train comin’ down the track
   God came thru Bellville Georgia
   He was ridin’ on the noon-day train
   It’s all power to Him and praise His holy name
   He never got off of the train
   He never got off of the train.
I’ve never had a day like that since I have been alive
My body full of feelin’ there was vision in my eyes
I’ve traveled this world over just to meet that certain train
And I knew my life will never be the same
Well I don’t know where He’s goin’ but I know He likes to ride
Across the hills and valleys through the prairies thru the skies
And I know the time is comin’ if the world don’t ever change
Everybody’s got to meet that train.

Don’t remind me of things in my past
Oh, I’ve fallen down along the way
You’re not the first, you won’t be the last
In fact you’re the second one today
But that don’t get me down, what’s done is done
And I refuse to relive yesterday
I believe my best days are yet to come
If I can only get this one out of the way
   I don’t think about tomorrow
   Yesterday is past and gone
   Don’t judge me by my past and I’ll try
   And do better in days to come
Should you see me cryin’ today
Oh, it won’t be ‘cause I’m lookin’ back
I don’t deal with old memories that way
Those tragic scenes have faded to black
They don’t get me down, what’s done is done
I’ve only room to feel today’s pain
When the sun comes up on another day
I’ll put yesterday behind me once again
It won’t get me down, what’s done is done
And I refuse to relive yesterday
Cause I believe my best days are yet to come
If I can only get this one out of the way

Better late than never
Better let you see
Better late than never
Darlin’ wait for me
The other night I seen my girl
We had a date
Supposed to been there at seven
Showed up at eight
Yonder comes a man into my house
For his revenue
He said I’ll pay it up my friend
Give me a day or two
Now if you love your women
Like I do mine
Give ’em a little lovin’
Just any time

So your of love has finally reached its ending
The winner smiles as you are left behind
You will taste the better cup of love’s illusion
Just chalk one up and better luck next time
Better luck next time for now you’re reaping
All the bitterness that once was mine
Live and love then learn the fate that’s pending
A broken heart but better luck next time
There’s no way that we can look into the future
But a lesson we may learn from scenes behind
In the future there’s a promise of tomorrow
If given you then better luck next time

Well the cows went dry the hens don’t lay
there’s no place I can borrow
Give the landlord all the news
and the rent comes due tomorrow
Lots of money in the bank
they say that’s where they keep it
Not only wouldn’t they loan me some
they wouldn’t let me see it
 So pick away on the old banjo
Keep that guitar strumming
Put more water in the soup
There’s better times a-coming
Well Mary Lou could pull a plow
if only I would let her
Twice as strong as any ox
and she don’t smell much better
I didn’t kiss that Mary Lou but once
and then I had to leave her
Make’s my collar get so tight
I start to burn with fever
Well a man came by the other day
a-huntin manual labor
I told him I hadn’t seen the guy
why don’t he ask the neighbor
So come on boys get your gals
and kick your heels up higher
Don’t let no one steal your gal
just hold her a little tighter
My rooster used to chase a hen
he just kept getting thinner
He nearly ran himself to death
so I bought him in for dinner
Cotton crops are mighty poor
the weeds are really a-growin
I need a woman pretty bad
to help me with the hoein’

Big ball in Boston big ball in town
Big ball in Boston gonna dance around.
Little glass of sherry little glass of wine
Let’s have a party let’s have a time.
My love’s in jail boys my love’s in jail
My love’s in jail boys who’ll go her bail?
Roll on the ground boys roll on the ground
Eating soda crackers ten cents a pound.
Look at all the pretty girls walking down the street
Kicking up their heels they’re happy on their feet

Woke up this morning heard the whistle blow
The jailor said come boy it’s time to go
Big midnight special shine your light on me
Big midnight special shine your ever loving light on me
I’ve never had the blues so in my life before
‘Til my baby left me at the station door
They put him in a pullman guards around his door
Said you off to Atlanta to serve ten years more
He looked all around him in the pullman car
Saw the men wearing clothe hats smoking big cigars
Took him off in Atlanta at the end of the line
Said you start serving time boy for your awful crime
That whistle makes me lonesome on that midnight train
But he knows I’m a-waiting ’til it brings him home again

One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning
Down the track came a hobo hiking and he said boys I’m not turning
I’m headin for a land that’s far away beside the crystal fountains
So come with me we’ll go and see the Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains there’s a land that’s fair and bright
Where the handouts grow on bushes and you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars are all empty and the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees
Where the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft boiled eggs
The farmer’s trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay
Oh, I’m bound to go where there ain’t no snow
Where the rain don’t fall and the wind don’t blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol come a-trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind
There’s a lake of stew and of whiskey too
You can paddle all around ’em in a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains the jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again as soon as you are in
There ain’t no short handled shovels, no axes saws or picks
I’m a goin to stay where you sleep all day
Where they hung the jerk that invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
I’ll see you all this coming fall in the Big Rock Candy Mountains

Can’t you hear the whistle of my big spike hammer
Lord it’s busting my side
I’ve done all I can do to keep that woman happy
Still she’s not satisfied
   Hey hey Della Mae
   Why do you treat me this way
   Hey hey Della Mae
   I’ll get even some day
I’m the best hammer swinger on this big section gang
Big Bill Johnson is my name
Lord this hammer that I swing for a dollar and a half a day
I’ll all for my Della Mae
Now I’ve been lots of places, not much I ain’t done
There’s still alot of things I’d like to see
Lord this hammer that I swing or the woman that I love
Yes, one’s gonna be the death of me

When I was young I spent my summer days
playing on the track.
The sound of the wheels rolling on the steel
took me out took me back
   Big train from Memphis
   Big train from Memphis
   now it’s gone gone gone
   gone gone gone
Like no one before he let out a roar
and I just had to tag along
each night I went to bed with the sounds in my head
and the dream was the song
Well I rode ’em in and back out again
and you know what they say about trains
But I’m tellin you when that Memphis train came through
this old world was not the same

Went up on the mountain
Just to give my horn a blow
Thought I heard my true love say
Yonder comes my beau
   Bile them Cabbage down
   Turn them hoecakes round
   The only song that I can sing
   Is bile them cabbage down
Took my gal to the blacksmith shop
To have her mouth made small
She turned around a time or two
And swallowd shop and all
Possum in a Simmon tree
Raccoon on the ground
Raccoon says you son-of-a-gun
Shake some Simmon’s down
Someone stole my old ‘coon dog
Wish they’d bring him back
He chased the big hogs through the fence
And the little ones through the crack
Met a possum in the road
Blind as he could be
Jumped the fence and whipped my dog
And bristled up at me
Once I had an old gray mule
His name was Simon Slick
He’d roll his eyes and back his ears
And how that mule would kick
How that mule would kick
He kicked with his dying breath
He shoved his hind feet down his throat
And kicked himself to death

Billy Grey rode into Gantry, back in ’83
There he did meet young Sarah McRae
The wild rose of morning, that pale flower of dawning
Herald of springtime in his young life that day. 
Sarah she could not see the daylight of reality
In her young eyes Billy bore not a flaw
Knowing not her chosen one was a hired gun
Wanted in Kansas City by the law. 
Then one day a tall man came riding ‘cross the badlands
Lying to the North of New Mexico
He was over her to say he was lookin’ for Bill Grey
A ruthless man and a dangerous outlaw. 
Well, the deadly news came creepin’ to Billy fast sleeping
There in the Claredon bar and hotel
He fled toward the old church, there on the outskirts
Thinkin’ he’d climb to that old steeple bell. 
But a rifle ball came flying, face down he lay there dying
There in the dust of the road where he fell
Sara she ran to him just cursing the law man
Accepting no reason knowin’ he was killed. 
Sarah lives in that same old white frame house
Where she first met Billy some fifty years ago
And wild rose of morning she’s faded with the dawning
For each day of sorrow the long years have sown. 
And written on the stone where the dusty winds have long blown
Eighteen words to a passing world say
“True love knows no season, no rhyme nor no reason
Justice is cold as the Cranger County clay.” 
Yes . . . true love knows no season . . . .

I’ll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid
I’ll sing of the reckless deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time ago
When a man’s only friend was his own forty-four
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out in the west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man
Fair Mexico maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Now here is young manhood that reached its sad end
He’d notch on his pistol for twenty-one men
Now ’twas on the same night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends:”I’m not satisfied
It’s twenty-one men that I’ve put bullets through
And sherriff Pat Garrett’s gonna make twenty-two”
Now this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The poor outlaw’s life had reached its sad end
Now this is the true song of Billy the Kid
These were the reckless deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time ago
When a man’s only friend was his own forty-four
There’s many a fine boy with a face fine and fair
Who starts out in life with a chance to be square
But just like poor Billy he wanders astray
Then he loses his life in the very same way

Last night the pale moon was shining
Last night when all was still
I wandered alone in sadness
Out among the woodland hills
I heard the birds a-singing
Out among the trees and views
And every bird, my darling
Was singing, was singing of you
   Was singing, singing of you, my love
   Was singing, was singing of you
   And every bird, my darling
   Was singing, was singing of you
I think of you in the daytime
I dream of you at night
I wake and wish you were here, love,
And tears are blinding my sight
The flowers that slumber so sweetly
The stars above the blue
Oh heaven itself, my darling
Is thinking, is thinking of you
I open my window so gently
And look on the dreamy view
The world itself, my darling
Is sighing, is sighing for you

On the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echo to her footsteps as soft as ider down
Waiting for her master to kiss away the tears
Waitin’ through the years
Bitter Green they called her walkin’ in the sun
Lovin’ everyone that she me
Bitter Green they called her waitin’ in the sun
Waitin’ for someone to take her home
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea
Some say he was a prison’r who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreamin’ of a kiss
But now that bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger his tears fall in the dust
Knealin’ by the churchyard in the autumn mist
Deamin’ of a kiss

Black eyed Susie went to town
All she wore was a gingham gown
 Hey Black eyed Susie
Ho Black eyed Susie
Hey Black eyed Susie Jane.
I may get drunk I may get woozy
But I’m comin’ home to Black eyed Susie
Black eyed Susie’s long and tall
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
Hey old man I want your daughter
To chop my wood and carry my water
Black eyed Susie lives in a holler
She won’t come and I won’t call her
All I want in this creation
Pretty little wife on a big plantation.
All I need to make me happy
Two little boys to call me Pappy.
One name Sop and the other name Gravy
One sop it up and the other gonna save it.
Up Red Oak and down salt water
Some old man gonna lose his daughter.
Black eyed Susie went huckleberry pickin’
Came home late and took a lickin’.
Love my wife and love my baby
Love my biscuits sopped in gravy.
Goin’ back home with a pocket full of money
Somebody there to call me honey.

I was standin’ by the road in Black Jack County.
Not knowing that the Sheriff paid a bounty,
For men like me who didn’t have a penny to their name.
He locked my legs in 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
All we had to eat was bread and water,
Everyday we had to build his road a mile and a quarter,
A Black Snake Whip would sting our backs if some poor fool complained,
But we couldn’t fight back wearing 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
Then one night while the Sheriff lay a sleepin’,
We all gathered round him slowly creepin’,
Heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain,
When we beat him to death wearing 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
The wounds have all healed and I am thankful,
And there’s nothing left but scars around my ankle.
But best of all no man will ever be a slave again,
To a Black Snake Whip and 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.
But best of all no man will ever be a slave again,

Black Jack Davey come a running through the woods
Singing so loud and gaily
Made the hills a round him ring
Then charmed the heart of a lady, charmed the heart of a lady 
How old are you my pretty little miss
How old are you my honey
Answered him with a philly and a smile
I’ll be sixteen next Sunday, be sixteen next Sunday 
Come go with me my pretty little miss
Come go with me my honey
I’ll take you across the deep blue sea
Where you never shall want for money, never shall want for money 
She pulled off her high heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
She put on her low heeled shoes
And they both went off together, both went off together 
Last night I lay on a warm feather bed
Side my husband and baby
Today I lay on the cold, cold ground
Side of Black Jack Davey, side of Black Jack Davey

As time draws near my dearest dear when you and I must part
How little you know of the grief and woe in my poor aching heart
Each night I suffer for your sake, you’re the girl I love so dear
I wish that I was going with you or you were staying here 
I wish my breast were made of glass wherein you might behold
Upon my heart your name lies wrote in letters made of gold
In letters made of gold my love, believe me when I say
You are the one that I will adore until my dying day 
The blackest crow that ever flew would surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you bright day will turn to night
Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will mourn
If ever I prove false to you the seas will rage and burn
 
And when you’re on some distant shore think of your absent friend
And when the wind blows high and clear a light to me pray send
And when the wind blows high and clear pray send your love to me
That I might know by your hand light how time has gone with thee
 

With a draw from either hand
I was known as Blackie’s gunman
The best two gunman in the land
I could shoot the ace of diamonds
With the dice I had no equal
Some of them are with us now
Most of them are sadly sleeping
Neath the weeping willow bough
Many a cowboy’s game I’ve played in
Left that night with all their gold
As a sport I was broken
As a sport I let it go
I once loved a girl named Nellie
How we loved no tongue can tell
But I know I’ll never meet her
Oh it was hard to say farewell
Her eyes were like the deep blue water
And her hair was golden curls
And her cheeks were golden velvet
And her teeth were snow white pearls
Together we lived in a cottage
And our life it was a dream
And the angels they watched o’er us
Made our life one happy dream

In my lonely heart there lingers
A dream that haunts me again
Of a girl with eyes like the flowers
That grew down in Blue Bonnet Lane
 On the sweet and happy hours
In my heart they will always remain
Like the sweet fragrance of the flowers
That grew down in Blue Bonnet Lane
I can see a pale moon rising
Above a blue misty plane
As I walk with my blue eyed darling
In my memory once again

I remember the ways and the bygone days
When we were all in our prime
How us and John L. we gave the old man hell
Down in the Blue Diamond Mine
When the whistle blowed and the rooster crowed
Two hours before daylight
When a man done his best and he earned a good rest
And had seventeen dollars at night
   In the mines in the mines
   In the Blue Diamond Mines
   I’ve worked my (whole-1*) (poor-2*) (– -3*) life away
   In the mines in the mines
   In the Blue Diamond Mine
   Go fall on your knees and pray.
You old black gold you’ve taken my lungs
And your dust has darkened my home
And now that we’re old you’re turning your back
But where else can an old miner go
It’s  Algoma Block and it’s Big Leatherwood
And now it’s Blue Diamond too
The pits they are closing get another job
But what else can an old miner do
John L. had a dream but it’s broken it seems
And the union is letting us down
Last night they took away my hospital card
Saying why don’t you leave this old town.
So I’ll go downtown and I’ll hang around
And maybe it ain’t so bad
But when you get home your kids will meet you at the door
Saying what did you bring me dad

He was just a blue eyed Boston boy his voice was low with pain
I’ll do your bidding, comrade mine if you will do the same
But if you should ride and I should fall you’ll do as much for me
While mother at home is awaiting the news so write to her tenderly 
She’s waiting at home like a patient saint her pale face filled with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am dead I’ll see her face no more
Just then the order came to charge for a moment hand touched hand
They answered aye and on they rode that brave and devoted band 
Straight way was the course to the top of the hill and the Rebels with shot and shell
Plowed furrows of death midst the toiling ranks and guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying sound from the heights they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared rode slowly back again 
But among the dead at the top of the hill lay the boy with the golden hair
And the tall dark man who rode by his side lay still beside him there
There was none to write to the blue-eyed girl the words her lover had said
While mother at home is awaiting her boy she’ll only find he’s dead 
While mother at home is awaiting her boy she’ll only find he’s dead

The days have passed by so slowly
Since you’ve gone and left me blue
If ever you decide to roam dear
Remember I’m waiting just for you
   Won’t you be my blue eyed darlin
   Won’t you come back home to me
   Don’t tell me that you’ve found another
   Darling please don’t set me free
At night as I lay down to sleep dear
The tears are flowing down my cheeks
Because you left me such a memory
And now I’m all alone you see
Someday you’ll come and I’ll be gone dear
Somewhere to start my life anew
But if you never do return dear
Remember I’ve waited just for you

In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes cryin’ in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we’d never meet again
   Love is like a dying ember
   And only memories remain
   And through the ages I’ll remember
   Blue eyes cryin’ in the rain.
Someday when we meet up yonder
We’ll stroll hand in hand again
In the land that knows no parting
Or blue eyes cryin’ in the rain.

In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted
I know we’d never meet again
    Love is like a dying ember
    Only memories remain
    Through the ages I’ll remember
    Blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I’ve loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday when we meet up yonder
We’ll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Well I’m on my way tonight
And I hope the road is right
For I’ve got to have you back
Even if I have to steal
Blue is the way that I feel
I’ve been on this road so long
I guess your love for me is gone
But I’m coming back somehow
For my love for you is real
Blue is the way that I feel

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that’s gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that’s gone and left me blue
    It was on a moonlight night the stars were shining bright
    When they whispered from on high your love has said good-bye
    Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
    Shine on the one that’s gone and said good-bye

Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night I can’t keep from crying
You met someone that was new
You quit someone that you knew was true
Blue night I got you on my mind
Blue night blue as I can be
I don’t know what’ll become of me
Where we used to walk I walk alone
With an aching heart because my love is gone
Blue night blue as I can be
Blue night ’cause I’m all alone
I used to call you on the telephone
I used to call and it made you glad
Now I call and it makes you mad
Blue night ’cause I’m all alone
Blue night all by myself
Since you put me on that shelf
There’s just one thing that you must know
You’re gonna reap just what you sow
Blue night, all by myself
Blue night, all by myself

Blue railroad train
Going down the railroad tracks
It makes me feel so doggone blue
To listen to that old smokestack
Come back again
Let me hear the whistle blow
You’re taking the sun and leaving the rain
And I hate to see you go
Blue railroad train
Leaving me far behind
Gimme back the good old days
And let me ramble down the line
Blue railroad train
Leaving me her alone
You treat me good you treat me bad
You’re making me think of home
I’ve got the blues
I’m longing for your company
It’s many miles from where I am
To the only one for me
It’s lonely here
Waiting for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind
Enough to let me be his guest
I’m not as bad
As you might think I am
I hobo here I hobo there
I’ve traveled these states around
Blue railroad train
A good old pal to me
You take me where I want to go
And my transportation’s free

There’s a well beaten path in the old mountainside
Where I wandered when I was a lad
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
In those Blueridge hills far away
   Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
   From those Blueridge hills I did roam
   When I die won’t you bury me on the mountain
   Far away near my Blueridge mountain home
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
They are sleeping in peace together there
I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
I’ve been longing for days gone by
When I die won’t you bury me on that old mountain side
Make my resting place upon the hills so high

When I was young and in my prime
I left my home in Caroline
Now all I do is sit and pine
For all the folks I left behind
I’ve got them Blue Ridge Mountain blues
And I stand right here and say
My grip is packed to travel and I’m scratchin’ gravel
For that Blue Ridge far away
Well I’m gonna stay right by my Pa
And I’m gonna do right by my Ma
I’ll hang around that cabin door
No work or worry anymore
I’ve got them Blue Ridge Mountain blues
Gonna see my old dog Trey
Gonna hunt the possum where the corn tops blossom
On that Blue Ridge far away
Now I see a window with a light
I see two heads of snowy white
It seems I hear them both recite
Where is my wandering boy tonight
I’ve got those Blue Ridge Mountain blues
And I stand right here to say
Every day I’m counting ’til I find that mountain
On that blue ridge far away

   Blue Ridge Mountain memories
   Dreams of home so dear to me
   I wish life could be like it used to be
   In my Blue Ridge Mountain memories
I still envision that old homestead on a hillside far away
I can see the Blue Ridge Mountains where I spent my childhood days
When I start wishin’ things could be the way they were back then
I can close my eyes and wander back again
I can still see Mom and Daddy and remember how they cried
When I headed west searchin’ for a better way of life
Though I found fame and fortune I feel empty and alone
Riches can’t replace a parent’s love or home
Now Mom and Dad are resting near the Blue Ridge Mountain cabin
They sleep there overlooking the only place they’ve ever known
I’ve been all around this whole wide world but nothing can compare
To the beauty of that Blue Ridge Mountain home

   Blue skies and teardrops got me down
   And the wheat straw in the wind keeps blowing round and round.
   Miles full of emptiness is all I’ve found
   And the road says you’ve got to move along.
Does anybody passing by know how I feel?
As another morning settles like the dust behind my heels
In the shadow of a restless soul born on wheels
I’m bound to sing the highway’s in the song.
Now the wandering song within me is a song I’ve learned
When I heard the freight trains whistle and my head was turned
The carefree chorus of that liner as she burned
Now the lineman says you’ve got to move along.
Now I left the years and miles lying where they fell
Among the book my soul was written and the tales my shoes could tell
I left them lying there for someone else to tell
And the road says you’ve got to move along.

Have you ever been to Richmond in November
When the cold Virginia rain is coming down
Friends I’m here to tell you it’s no pleasure
When you’re all alone and a stranger to this town.
Don’t take me wrong I do like East Virginia
And Richmond’s full of hospitality
Except for one Virginia girl I know of
Who made a perfect love wreck out of me.
   Blue blue Virginia blue
   There’s no blue like blue Virginia blue
   No other girls in the whole wide world
   Will break your heart like Virginia girls
   There’s no blue like blue Virginia blue
She called me up in St Paul Minnisota
Said I need you here in Richmond right away
Take the bus I’ll meet you at the station
Bring your clothes ’cause I want you to stay.
My bus pulled in the station late this evening
And there’s no one around this place but me
She must have changed her mind or she’s forgotten
And her name’s not in the phone directory.
I wish I had the money for a taxi
And a warm and cozy place to go lie down
Instead of standin’ all alone in Richmond
While the cold Virginia rain is comin’ down.

She’s long she’s tall, she six feet from the ground
She’s long she’s tall, she six feet from the ground
She tailor made, lord she ain’t no hand me down
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
She got eyes like diamonds, lord her teeth shine just the same
She got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
She got sweet ruby lips, and a hair like a horse’s mane
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
Every time I see you mama, you’re always on the street
Every time I see you mama, you’re always on the street
You hang out on the corner, like a police on his beat
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
Every time I need you mama, lord I always find you’re gone
Every time I need you mama, lord I always find you’re gone
Listen hear sweet mama, I’m gonna put your air brakes on
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee

She’s long she’s tall she’s six feet from the ground
She’s long she’s tall she’s six feet from the ground
She’s tailor made Lord she ain’t no hand me down
Yodel layee oh a layee oh alayee.
She’s got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
Well she’s got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
She’s got red ruby lips she’s got hair like a horse’s mane
Yodel layee oh a layee oh alayee.
Everytime I see you mamma well you’re always on the street
Everytime I see you mamma you’re always on the street
You hang out on the corner like the policeman on his beat
Yodel layee oh a layee oh alayee.
Everytime I need you mamma Lord I always find you gone
Everytime I need you mamma I always find you gone
Listen here sweet mamma you better put your air brakes on
Yodel layee oh a layee oh alayee.

There was a girl I loved so dearly
She lived away back in the hills
When the bluebird sings, I miss my darling
She loved me I know, she always will
   There’s a bluebird singing (there’s a bluebird singing)
   In the Blue Ridge mountains (in the Blue Ridge mountains)
   It’s calling me back to my home
   Oh, I can hear (Oh I can hear)
   The bluebirds calling (the bluebirds calling)
   Calling me back to my home
Now tonight I’m far from the blue ridge mountains
Far from my home back in the hills
But I’m going back to the blue ridge mountains
These memories they haunt me still
When I reached home I was so lonely
The one I loved had gone away
That bad news came from her mother
She’s sleeping there beneath the clay

Riding the bluegrass express
Riding the bluegrass express
This train will soon be gone
And I’m going home on the bluegrass express
She’ll cross the river at Newport town
Louisville Lexington she’s southbound
Richmond Winchester Bowling Green
Prettiest place I’ve ever seen

There’s a Truck Driver down in old Kentucky
And he loves to listen to that Bluegrass music
Everywhere he goes you can hear that old banjo
And they call him the Bluegrass Truck Driver
When the jukebox starts playing country music
You can bet he’ll have that Bluegrass song
When you hear the guitar and the banjo ringing
You’ll know the Bluegrass Truck Driver’s back in town
Everytime he goes into a truck stop
He always starts the Bluegrass music spinning
He does that old Kentucky buck then climbs back on his truck
That’s why they call him the Bluegrass Truck Driver

Did you ever wonder why
All you do is sit and cry
Could it be that your baby’s left and gone
Your happiness is through
Memories are no use to you
Now you’ve got the blues for your own
   You walk through the night and you wonder
   Or you sing yourself a sad and lonesome song
   In time the pain will end, ’til then you’ve got a friend
   ‘Cause you’ve got the blues for your own
You say you just don’t care
About a casual affair
That’ll bring back memories better left alone
You can’t chase them away
These blues are here to stay
Now you’ve got the blues for your own

Now I often hate you for these blues in my mind
What makes me love you am I losing my mind
I wonder where I’m gonna wind up
I just can’t make my crazy mind up
Too many kisses brought me too many tears
Tears that I’ll carry with me all through the years
I’m just a broken hearted guy
Worry put these blues in my mind
Now I’m going crazy with these blues in my mind
How can you just keep on confusing my mind
You got a jealous air about you
Maybe I’m better off with out you
I just can’t make my heart believe that it’s true
The trouble with me is havin’ trouble with you
I’m just a broken hearted guy
Worry put these blues in my mind

   Blues stay away from me   
   Blues why don’t you let me be
   I don’t know why you keep on haunting me
Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
It seems somehow we never can agree
Life is full of misery   
Dreams are like a memory
Bringing back your love that used to be 
Tears so many I can’t see
Years don’t mean a thing to me
Time goes by and still I can’t be free

See that train coming round the bend,
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth,
But her soul has been called up above
   Body and Soul, Body and Soul,
   That’s how she loved me, with Body and Soul
Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as blue as the sea,
Her lips were the color of summer’s red rose,
And she promised she would always love me
Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down, she’s laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are falling like rain

Met the girl I love in a town way down in Dixie
‘Neath the stars above she was the sweetest girl I ever did see
So I took her in my arms and told her of her many charms
I kissed her while the fiddles played the Bonaparte’s Retreat
   All the world was bright as I held her on that night
   And I heard her say Please don’t ever go away
   So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms
   I kissed her while the fiddles played the Bonaparte’s Retreat

Goodbye my little bonnie blue eyes
Goodbye my little bonnie blue eyes
You’ve told me more lies than the stars in the skies
Goodbye my little bonnie blue eyes
I saw my little bonnie last night
She looked so dear to me
She’s the only girl I ever loved
She’s now gone back on me
Oh stand at the gate and weep
Oh stand at the gate and weep
Oh stand at the gate and weep and morn
Oh bonnie wont you love me once more
Come and lay your hand in mine
Come and lay your hand in mine
Come and lay your arms around my neck
And say that you will be mine
Oh you know what you promised me
Oh you know what you promised me
You promised that you’d marry me
Oh you know what you promised me
I’ve stayed in the country too long
I’ve stayed in the country too long
The only wrong that I have done
I’ve stayed in the country too long
Come and go with me too the train
Come and go with me too the train
Come and go with me and see me get on
Goodbye my little bonnie I’m gone

In the land of Breathed County was raised a crooked man
Made the county dry and the prices high
For the bootleg whiskey man
His age was barely twenty-one, his family was ashamed
They had a son who left his home
For a bootleg whiskey game
   Bootleg John won’t you come on home
   Your family’s all alone
   You’re runnin’ wild and your baby child
   Wants his daddy home
His wife she loved hime dearly tho’ he seldom came around
She’d always cry when he said goodbye
But she never could hold him down
Twelve pistols in his pocket his shotgun on the floor
He made his run to Lexington
To the bootleg whiskey store
His car was full of whiskey, his hand was on his gun
He was set to go but he didn’t know
He was makin’ his last run
The sheriff pulled him over and he shot the lawman down
They locked him well in the county jail
And the jailer slapped him down

Born to lose I’ve lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I’ve always been so blue
Born to lose and now I’m losing you.
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you’re not there
You’ve grown tired and now you say we’re through
Born to lose and now I’m losing you.
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It’s so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I’m losing you.

Coming down from Tennessee riding on the line
Thinking about the girl of mine couldn’t keep from crying
   Honey babe I’m bound to ride
   Don’t you want to go
Riding on a streetcar looking o’er the town
Eating saltine crackers ten cents a pound
Working on a railroad saving all I can
Looking for that woman ain’t got no man
If I die a railroad man bury me under the ties
So I can see old number nine as she goes rolling by
See that train a coming round the bend
Goodbye my little darling I’m on my way again

When it’s decoration day in Heaven
There’s a bouquet I’m longing to see
There’s a flower somewhere in the bouquet
That means all the world to me
Now she left the old homeplace is lonely
Since mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her
‘TiI we meet on that decoration day.
I remember the night the angles called her
To live on that beautiful shore
It left us so lonely here without her
It can never be like home anymore.

We have been so close together
Each a candle each a flame
All the dangers were outside us
And we knew them all by name
   See how the bramble and the rose
   Intertwine
   Love grows like the bramble and the rose
   Round each other we will twine
Now I’ve hurt you and it hurts me
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other
Without really meaning to
So put your arms around me
And we’ll sing a true love song
And we’ll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

Life to me is just a heartache
Since the day you said goodbye
Now I’ve nothing left to live for
All I do is sit and cry
   I can’t outlive the memory of you
   Since the day we had to part
   All I have just a memory
   And a brand new broken heart
All I have is just a memory
A picture painted in my heart
It hurts to know you’re gone forever
And forever more we’ll be apart

I’m breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Don’t look at me like you think I’ve got the blues
‘Cause I’m walking ’round and around and I’m seeing most of the town
I’m just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
   Ah ha so I’m talking to myself
   Oh no she’s not putting me on the shelf
   I’m just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
I’m doggone if I’m gonna cry the blues
My feet are sore but I’ve got no time to lose
‘Cause I’m wanting her here with me and I’m needing her company
I’m just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes

Oh you have such a pretty face
You favor a girl I once knew
I imagine that she’s in Tennessee
Oh Lord I should be there too.
But I left Tennessee in a hurry dear
The same way that I’m leaving you
For love is mainly just memories
And everyone’s got them but few.
   It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
   You’re literally just waltzing on air
   It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
   With no telling who will be there
When I leave it’ll be like I found you love
Descending victorian stairs
I’m feeling like one of your photographs
With not even you left to care.
Have all your passionate violins play
A tune for a Tennessee kid
Who’s feeling like leaving another town
With no place to go if he did.

I am the bravest cowboy that’s ever tried the West
I’ve been all around the Rockies got bullets in my breast
I’ve been all around the Rockies got bullets in my breast
In eighteen hundred and sixty three I joined the immigrant band
We marched from San Antonio down by the Rio Grande
We marched from San Antonio down by the Rio Grande
I went out on the prairie I learned to throw the line
I learned to pocket money but I did not dress so fine
I learned to pocket money but I did not dress so fine
I went out on the prairie and learned to rob and steal
And when I robbed that cowboy how happy I did feel
And when I robbed that cowboy how happy I did feel
I wore a wide brim high hat my saddle too was fine
And when I courted a pretty girl you’d bet I called her mine
And when I courted a pretty girl you’d bet I called her mine
I courted her for beauty for love it was in vain
They carried me down to Dallas to wear a ball and chain
They carried me down to Dallas to wear a ball and chain

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a’breaking in my soul
Oh where are our dear fathers
Oh where are our dear fathers
They’re down in the valley a praying
Day is a’breaking in my soul
Oh where are our dear mothers
Oh where are our dear mothers
They’ve gone to heaven a shoutin
Day is a’breaking in my soul
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a’breaking in my soul

There’s a little church on Sunday morning
Where I go to kneel and pray
It’s a place that God reserves for all
While here on earth we stay
It’s a place to lose your cares and worries
And to leave the load you bear
It’s a stepping stone on the road to glory
There’s a brighter mansion over there
    There’s a brighter brighter mansion a brighter brighter mansion
    In a world that’s free from care
    It’s a home eternal in the Heavens
    There’s a brighter mansion over there
There the Savior standing at God’s right hand
Who will harken to our call
By His sweat and blood on the cross at Calvary
Gave His life for one and all
Now by grace thru faith we attain His mercy
And with beauties we will share
There’s a sacred promise that He made to all
There’s a brighter mansion over there

Tis true the rain that has no end
It’s hard to find a faithful friend
And when you find one just and true
He’s dropped the old one for the new
   
   Bring back my blue eyed boy to me
   Bring back my blue eyed boy to me
   Bring back my blue eyed boy to me
   That I may ever happy be
Must I go bound and have no free
Must I love a boy that don’t love me
Or must I act the childish part
And love that boy that broke my heart
Last night my lover promised me
To take me across the deep blue sea
And now he’s gone and left me alone
An orphan girl without a home
O dig my grave both wide and deep
Place marble at my head and feet
And on my breast a snow white dove
To show to the world I died for love

‘Tis true the rainbow has no end
It’s hard to find a faithful friend
And when you find one just and true
Change not the old one for the new
 Bring back my blue-eyed boy to me
Bring back my blue-eyed boy to me
Bring back my blue-eyed boy to me
That I may ever happy be
Must I go bound and him go free
Must I love the boy that don’t love me
Or must I act the childish part
And love that boy that broke my heart
Last night my lover promised me
To take me across the deep blue sea
And nows he’s gone and left me alone
An orphaned girl without a home
Oh dig my grave both wide and deep
Place a marble at my head and feet
And on my breast a snow-white dove
To show to the world I died for love

It’s a steep and windy road
and it’s a mighty heavy load
For this one man to live life this way
I’m spending most of my time
thinkin’ with a worried mind
I got a feeling this feelings’ here to stay
So bring on the blues
bring on the blues
It’s the one thing I just can’t lose
I maybe right I maybe wrong
I’ll leave this world this one ol’ song
About the way that I’m feelin’ tonight
Been ’round the world sailed the sea
I got the feelin’ I’m losin’ this fight

See the engine puffing, boy she’s making time
That old trains wearing out the rail, rail, rail
Heading for the mountain that she’s got to climb
Bringing in the Georgia mail
Ninety miles an hour and she’s gaining speed
Listen to the whistle moan and wail, wail, wail
Has she got the power I’ll say yes indeed
Bringing in the Georgia mail
See the driver’s travel watch her spin the track
Ought to put that engineer in jail, jail, jail
Has he got her rolling watch her ball the jack
Bringing in the Georgia mail
Rocking and a reeling spouting off the steam
Stoke the fire and hope the brakes don’t fail, fail, fail
Serving all the people listen to her scream
Bringing in the Georgia mail

I was driving down a lonely road one dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the roadside showed up in my headlights
I stopped and she got in back and in a shaky tone
She said: My name is Mary, please won’t you take me home? 
She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her, for her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet in the back seat all alone
I’ll never will forget that night I took Mary home
I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes ’cause the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn’t there
A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then a lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said: It sure was nice of you to go out of your way
But thirteen years ago today a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shone
You’re the thirteenth one who’s been here bringing Mary home

I’m a broken down tramp without money
My clothes are all tattered and torn
And I am so sad and so lonely
I wish I had never been born
All through this wide world I have wandered
Inquiring for something to do
But whenever I ask for a job of work
They say they have none for a tramp
Now drink was the cause of my downfall
And the money I had I’ve outrun
And the friends that were mine when I had it
Now pass by and call me a bum
Now don’t be too hasty to judge me
As I drift along with the tide
My clothes may be ragged and dirty
But a clean heart is beating inside
One night on a dark lonely railroad
A hobo all hungry and cold
Saw an empty boxcar on the siding
He climbed in and closed up the door
Six months he had rode on the railway
When the brakeman came ’round with his light
He was shoved from the car and was killed by the train
Because he was only a tramp
Now young men, let this be a warning
For all you who long for the road
Better stick to the straight life and don’t be like me
A poor bum to die in the cold

They were standing by the window
On the night he kissed her cheek
He had waited long in silence
Waited long for her to speak
When at last he whispered softly
As the cool breeze kissed her head
She had waited long to tell him
What they told her he had said
Oh they say you love another
That you never did love me
If these words be true my darling
I’ll forever set you free
They are true he hardly answered
As the sun and stars above
When they told you my intentions
Then they told you of my love
He turned deathly pale and angry
Left her standing by the gate
Sent a message by her sister
But the message came too late
God in Heaven sent an Angel
To relieve her ache and pain
She went drifting off to Heaven
On an Angel’s snow white wing
He was standing by her casket
As he looked upon her face
Then he realized he loved her
And no one could take her place

How could I be feeling happy
When you don’t love me anymore
You took my love and all my kisses
And you left my heart so sore
   I’d rather swim across the ocean
   Without the help of God or man
   Than be a broken hearted lover
   When I have done the best I can
I thought that you were an angel
When I first looked into your eyes
But now I know all about you
I know your home’s not in the skies
Stop, look and listen for that whistle
And when you hear that lonesome sound
You’ll know by the whistle of that freight train
Your broken hearted lover’s gone

The lord’s saved me I want the world to know
I’m on my way to glory land
There I’ll see Jesus and take Him by the hand
Brother I’m getting ready to go
   I’m getting ready to go I know
   I’m leaving this world here below
   Ain’t nothing in this world can turn me back I know
   Brother I’m getting ready to go
Say there wake up while yet you have time
And in the glory land wave
Jesus will hear you and answer your call
Get ready to meet him today
Brother don’t wait till it is too late
Jesus might call for you today
It’s awful to know when you leave this old world below
If you are not ready to go

I traveled to Kentucky to court a fair young girl
Whose eyes were of the darkest brown and her hair had a charming curl
She had the sweetest lips to kiss that I had ever found
And she made me feel as if I was the only man around
Some people think of horses when you talk of the Bluegrass State
Others think their bourbon is what makes it so great
But the reason that the Bluegrass State stands in my memory
Is that brown eyed Kentucky girl she means so much to me
I remember very clearly it was on a warm spring night
We declared we loved each other and to marry would be right
It was a short time later in the month of July
Our lives were joined together we were one she and I
Many years have come and gone since the day that we met
Our love has grown much stronger and it is growing yet
We have a happy home and children we have three
We still enjoy each other this Kentucky girl and me

Way up on old Linville Mountain
Where the bear and the catamount reign
A strange ghostly light appears every night
Which no scientist or hunter can explain.
In the days of the old covered wagon
When they camped on the flats for the night
With the moon shinin’ dim o’er the old canyon rim
They watched for that brown mountain light.
High on the mountain
And down in the valley below
It shines like the crown of an angel
And fades as the mists come and go
Way over yonder
Night after night until dawn
A faithful old slave comes back from the grave
Is searching for his master who’s long gone.
Many years ago a southern planter
Came huntin’ in this wide world alone
Then so they say the hunter lost his way
And never returned to his home.
His trusting ol’ slave brought a lantern
And searched but in vain day and night
Now the ol’ slave is gone
but his spirit lingers on
And the lantern it still casts it’s light.

Hard luck poppa counting his toes
You can smell his feet wherever he goes
Lord Lord. got those Brown’s Ferry Blues
Hard luck poppa can’t do his stuff
Trouble with him he’s been too rough
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues.
Two old maids a-sitting in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues
Two old maids done lost their style
If you want to be lucky you got to smile
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues.
Early to bed and early to rise
And your girl goes out with other guys
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues
If you don’t believe me try it yourself
Well I tried it and I got left
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues.
Hard luck poppa standing in the rain
If the world was corn he couldn’t buy grain
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues
His knees knock together but he’s raring to go
Lord Lord got those Brown’s Ferry Blues.

Tonight in a bar alone I’m sittin’
Apart from the laughter and cheer
The scenes from the past rise before me
While watchin the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to me eye
I know that my life’s been a failure
Just watchin’ the bubbles in my beer.
I’m seeing the road that I’ve traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
I’m seeing the past that I’ve wasted
While watching the bubbles in my beer.
I think of the hearts that I’ve broken
And of the golden chances that have passed me by
The dreams I once made now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer.

One stormy day, me and my buddy
Started on our roundup ride
The wind and dust blew hard around us,
My buddy strayed far from my side
   We were buddies in the saddle,
   We were buddies in our home,
   We were buddies herding cattle,
   We were buddies everywhere we roamed
I’ll ne’er forget the day I found him,
He was so weak he could not speak
I’ll ne’er forget the smile he gave me,
Then the poor boy fell asleep
I took him up in my saddle
And carried him across the plain
My mother nursed him every moment
To try to make him well again
I’ve never had a pal so near me,
He took the blame for everything
I’d die for him just any moment,
And for me he’d do the same
But now by buddy’s gone and left me,
And it’s so hard to struggle ‘long
So hard to believe that he has left me,
I can’t realize that he has gone

Buffalo gals won’t you come out tonight
Come out tonight Come out tonight
Buffalo gals wont you come out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon
Now I got a gal with a wart on her chin
Toes turned out and her eyes turned in
Prteey good gal for the shape she’s in
Tell me is she coming out tonight
Give you five dollars if you come out tonight
Come out tonight Come out tonight
Give you five dollars if you come out tonight
And dance by the light of the moon
I got a gal at the top of the hill
Top of the hill Top of the hill
She’s a moonshiner’s daughter
But I love her still
Tell me is she coming out tonight
Me and my gal we sit on the stoop
Sit on the stoop Sit on the stoop
Here dad came out and made me loop the loop
Tell me is she coming out tonight

(Just) build my mansion next door to Jesus
And tell the angels I’m coming home
It doesn’t matter who lives around me
Just so my mansion sets near the throne
I have no castles no earthly kingdom
But my cabin will do ’til I get home
My mansion’s yonder on the hills of glory
Oh I hope my mansion sets near God’s throne
It seems like it’s been a long time ago and get just yesterday
That Mom and Dad sat me down and told me about Jesus
They said Son, there ‘s a land and it’s called Heaven
I’ll never forget that day I’m saved because of it

Looking for that bully Bully of that town
Looking for that bully that bully can’t be found
I’m looking for that bully of the town
When I walk this levee round and round
Everyday I may be found
When I walk this levee round
I’m looking for that bully of the town

I was wild and reckless this hobo
And I left my happy home
And I started out on a westward trip
All by myself alone.
Oh my pocket book was empty and my heart it was filled with pain
I’m a thousand miles away from home just bummin’ an old freight train.
Just a’ bummin’ an old freight train oh Lord just bummin’ an old freight train
I’m a thousand miles away from home just bummin’ an old frieight train.
I was standing on that platform And smokin’ a cheap cigar
I was waiting for that old freight train to find me an empty car
Well I pulled my cap down over my eyes as I walked along the track
I caught the stirrup of a sleepin’ car And I never did look back.

So bury me under the lonesome pine tree
There they’ll forever sway over me
There I can hear the sound of the lonesome dove
In that beautiful land of peace and love
These lonesome pines are calling me home
Never again will I ever roam
They’ll carry me home and put me to rest
In that mighty fine land that I love best
For years I’ve been away but the time has come today
I’ll return to my homeland never to stray
For the rest of my days I’ll rest in peace
And never again no one to please

   Oh, bury me beneath the willow
   Under the weeping willow tree
   So she will know where I am sleeping
   And perhaps she’ll weep for me
My heart is sad I am lonely
For the only one I love
When shall I see her oh no never
‘Til we meet in heaven above
She told me that she dearly loved me
How could I believe it untrue
Until the angels softly whispered
She will prove untrue to you
Tomorrow was to be our wedding
God oh God where can she be
She’s out a courting with another
And no longer cares for me

O bury me not on the lone prairie
These words came low and mournfully
From the cold pale lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day
He’d wasted time til upon his brow
The shadowed clouds were gatherin’ now
He thought of his home and his friends so nigh
Oh the cowboys gathered to see him die
I fancy I’ll listen to the well known word
Of the free wild wind and the song of birds
He thought of his home and the cottonwood there
And the songs her learned in his childhood hour
I often thought I’d be laid when I die
In the old churchyard by the green hillside
By the side of my father let my grave be
O bury me not on the lone prairie
O bury me not on the lone prairie
Where the wild coyotes may howl over me
Where the buffalo roams and the winds blow free
O bury me not on the lone prairie
I want to be laid where mothers prayers
And sisters tears will mingle there
Where friends will come and weep over me
O bury me not on the lone prairie
O bury me not and his voice fell there
We heeded not his dying prayer
In a narrow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairie
We buried him there on the lone prairie
Where the buzzards fly and the wind blows free
Where rattlesnakes rattle and the tumbleweeds
Blow across his grave on the lone prairie
 

When I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my savior
By the mark where the nails have been 
   By the mark where the nails have been
   By the sign upon his precious skin
   I will know my savior when I come to him
   By the mark where the nails have been
A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the king of heaven
Can be told from the prince of fools 
On Calvary Mountain
Where they made him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago

Now people who would rather live in splendor
Brag about their silver and their gold
People who would trade God’s promise
For its treasure to hold
Now people who would rather live in mansions
People who would rather live abroad
But I’d rather have a little log cabin
By the side of the road
   I’d rather live by the side of the road
   And try to point souls to the heavenly cross
   Than to be a king or millionaire
   And live in mansions and bright array
I’d rather do my neighborly deed
Or help some traveler or a friend in need
I’d rather live by the side of the road
And help some pilgrim along life’s way
I’d rather have a cabin by the roadside
Where the pilgrim along life’s way
Help to point souls to Jesus to that city on high
Every day I want to help scatter roses
Every night I want my light to shine abroad
With a welcome from my little bay wind
By the side of the road

There are days so dark
That I seek in vain
For the face of my own true love
But the darkness hides
He is there to guide
By the light of the moon above
   Oh the lonesome pines
   Oh the lonesome pines
   Where I met that sweetheart of mine
   With her hand in mine
   And our hearts entwined
   As we strolled through the lonesome pines
Bright stars above
Two sweethearts in love
As we sang to the cooing doves
He has brought me back
To that mountain shack
By the touch of her hand in love

Tonight I’m alone without you my dear
It seems there’s a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill 
   Now someone has taken you from me
   And left me here all alone
   Just listen to the rain beat on my window pane
   In our little cabin home on the hill. 
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there’s a longing for you still
I’ll just keep it there so I won’t be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill 
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And there’s no more happiness for you
Just let your heart drift (turn) back once more, if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill.

There’s a cabin in the pines in the hills of Caroline
And a blue-eyed girl is waiting there for me
I’ll be going back someday and for her I’ll never stray
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline
   Oh the cabin in the shadows of the pines
   And a blue-eyed girl way down in Caroline
   Someday she’ll be my wife and we’ll live a happy life
   In the cabin in the hills of Caroline
I’m packin’ my grip for that long long trip
Back to the hills of Caroline
I want to see that blue-eyed girl she’s the sweetest in the world
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline.
And when it’s late at night and the moon is shinin’ bright
And the whipoorwill is calling from the hill
Then I’ll tell her of my love beneath the stars above
How I love her now and I know I always will.

I’m only a dreamer of romance
My love dreams can never come true
I’ll just pretend that I’m happy
And smile thru these tears dear at you
   I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
   Where all of our dreams would come true
   But another has taken my cabin
   And left me so lonely and blue
Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me
Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn’t our love dreams come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Of a cabin sweetheart dear and you

There’s a cabin on a mountain far away in Tennessee
Dearest place this side of heaven and it’s where I long to be
I’ve rambled this world over sailed upon the deep blue sea
But in a cabin on a mountain’s where my heart will always be
   I said good-bye to my blue-eyed mountain sweetheart
   Dearest girl in this whole wide world to me
   Every night of her I’m dreamin’
   In a cabin on a mountain far away In Tennessee.
Now my ramblin’ days are over for tonight I’m on my way
To that cabin on a mountain in Tennessee so far away
I searched this wide world over sailed upon the deep blue sea
But in a cabin with my darlin’s where my heart will always be

There’s a happy childhood home in my memory I can see
Standing out upon the hill ‘neath the shadow of the tree
If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill.
 Oh I want to wander back to the cabin on the hill
‘Neath the shadow of the tree I would like to linger still
Just to be with those I love joy my heart would over fill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill
But the saddest of it all I can never more return
To that happy childhood home matters not how much I yearn
If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill

Well I’m goin’ to California where they sleep out every night
Yes I’m goin’ to California where they sleep out every night
I’m leavin’ you mama ’cause you know you don’t treat me right.
Let me tell you something that mama you don’t know
Let me tell you something good gal you don’t know
Well I’m a do-right papa
I got a home everywhere I go
   I got the California blues and I’m sure gonna leave you here
   I got the California blues and I’m sure gonna leave you here
   I may ride the blinds
   I ain’t got no railroad fare.
Let me tell you mama while I sing this song
Listen to your daddy sing you this lonesome song
You got me worried now but I won’t be worried long.

My driftin’ memory goes back to the spring of ’43
When I was just a child in Mama’s arms
My Daddy plowed the ground and prayed
that some day he could leave
This run down mortgaged workload of a farm.
Then one night I heard my Daddy saying to my Mama
That he’d finally saved enough to go
California was his dream for paradise that he had seen
In pictures in magazines that told him so
   California Cotton fields
   Where labor towns were filled with great men with broken dreams
   California cotton fields
   As close to wealth as Daddy ever came
Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From Daddy’s belt to the fruit that Mama canned
Some folks came to say farewell and to see what all we had to sell
Some just came to shake my Daddy’s hand.
The Model A was loaded down and California bound
And good luck was just about four days away
The only change that I recall happening to my Daddy
Was when his dark hair turned to silver gray.

They call me long gone I’m leavin’ town
Don’t try to follow I can’t be found
I’ll take my rainbow and the sunshine free
And the only worry that I have’s in the sole of my shoe.
They caught me bummin’ in the park one day
You saw me thumbin’ on the old highway
Well listen baby don’t you know
That your dear old daddy’s got a home every where I go.
Well you took my money and my big fine farm
You thought you’d beat me but you didn’t by far
Well the big boys got me oh but I got away
And you’re gonna miss your dear old daddy some of these days.
Just need to follow that old black crow
Happy-go-lucky every where I go
Ain’t got no worries ain’t got no cares
An easy road and a lonesome road is all I share.

I have left the land of bondage with its earthly treasures
I’ve journeyed to the place where there is love on every hand
I’ve exchanged the land of heartaches for the land of pleasure
I’m camping, I’m camping, in Canaan’s happy land
   Every day I’m camping (camping) in the land of Canaan (Canaan)
   And in rapture I survey its wondrous beauty grand (Oh, Glory)
   Glory, hallelujah (I have) found the land of promise
   (And I’m) camping, I’m camping, in Canaan’s happy land
Out of Egypt I have traveled through the darkness dreary
Far over hills and valleys and across the desert sands
Thoughts of land that’s safe and homeward I shall not go weary
I’m camping, I’m camping, in Canaan’s happy land
Yes I’ve reached the land of promise with the saints of glory
My journey ended in a place so lovely and so grand
I’ve been led by Jesus to this blessed land of story
I’m camping, I’m camping, in Canaan’s happy land

You know that I can’t stay here anymore
I’m leaving away from this old town for sure
You made me out to be a fool now there’s nothing left to do
You know that I can’t stay here anymore
There’s rumor that you’ve been running ’round
It’s now become the gossip of the town
I can’t hold up my head no more so I’m walking out that door
You know that I can’t stay here anymore
I’ve been working hard everyday
Trying to make a better way
It makes no difference what I do there ain’t no way of pleasing you
You know I can’t stay here amymore

The days are long the nights are lonely
Since you left me all alone
I worried so my little darling
I worried so since you’ve been gone
   Sweetheart of mine can’t you hear me calling
   A million times that I love you best
   I mistreated you, darling, I’m sorry
   Come back to me is my request
I remember dear the night we parted
A big mistake had caused it all
If you come back sunshine will follow
If you stay away twill be my fall
The nights are long my little darling
Oh how I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke the sun was shining
I looked up and I saw your face

Oh listen to the train coming down the line
Trying to make up all their lost time
From Buffalo to Washington
You can wash my jumper starch my overalls
Catch a train they call the Cannonball
From Buffalo to Washington
My baby’s left me she even took my shoes
Enough to give a man these doggone worried blues
She’s gone she’s solid gone
Yonder comes the train coming down the track
Carry me away but it aint gonna carry me back
My honey babe my blue eyed babe
I’m going up north I’m going up north this fall
If luck don’t change I wont be back at all
My honey babe I’m leaving you

You can wash my jumper starch my overalls
Catch that train they call the Cannonball
From Buffalo to Washington
Yonder comes the train coming down the track
Carrying me away but it aint gonna carry me back
My honey babe my blue eyed babe
My baby left me she even took my shoes
Enough to give me the doggone worried blues
She’s gone she’s solid gone
I’m going up north I’m going up north this fall
If my luck don’t change I wont be back at all
My honey babe I’m leaving you

Love oh love careless love
Love oh love careless love
Love oh love oh careless love
See what careless love has done
Once I wore my apron low (3x)
I couldn’t keep you from my door
What oh what will mama say (3x)
When she learns I’ve gone astray
I love my mama and papa too (3x)
See what I get for lovin’ you
Now I wear my apron high (3x)
You pass my door you walk on by

Moon moon I can see you smilin’ low
You made me think of a sweetheart
A little girl that I loved so
After I’ve wondered the whole night through
Wonderin’ if you think of me
While I’m on my lonesome thinkin’ of someone
I’m thinkin’ only of you
   My Carolina sunshine girl
   You have turned my heart to stone
   My Carolina sunshine Girl
   You have left me all alone
I wonder why I sit and cry
When I really should laugh
At your little old photograph
For you’re the sweetest angel in this world
And I love love love you
My Carolina sunshine girl

She came to me said she knew me
Said she’d known me a long time
And she talked of being in love
With every mountain she had climbed
And she talked of trails she’d walked up
Far above the timberline
From that night on I knew I’d write songs
For Carolina in the pines.
There’s a full moon on the fourteenth
First quarter twenty-first
And a full moon in the last week
Brings a fullness to the earth.
There’s no guess work in the clockwork
Of the world’s heart or mine
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines.
As the frost grows on the windows
The wood stove smokes and glows
As the fire glows we can warm our souls
Makin’ rainbows in the coals.
And we talk of trails we walk up
Far above the timberline
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines.

Just an old house with the roof fallin’ in
Standin’ on the edge of the field
Watching the crops grow like its always done before
Nobody lives here anymore
The sun’s going down on the Carolina pines
I’m a long way from home
I miss that love of mine broken windows empty doors
Nobody lives here anymore
Old memories come whistling like the wind
Through the walls and the cracked window panes
And the grass is growing high around the kitchen door
Nobody lives here anymore
Once there were children and a few hired hands
A hard working woman and a bone tired man
Now that old sun steals across a dusty floor
Nobody lives here anymore

Back in the hills oh slow rollin’ hills
Where North Carolina comes close to the stars
There’s livin’ a lady who’s shinin’ so high
They call her the “Carolina Star’ 
She works at the factory from Monday through Friday
She’s raisin’ three daughters alone
Their daddy’s away, he’s chasing a dream
They’re waitin’ for the day that he comes home 
   Oh, Carolina
   Even stars get lonesome now and then
   Oh, Carolina
   Don’t you worry, he’ll be comin’ home again 
He’s playin’ his songs in Nashville
He’s pickin’ for tips in a bar
He’s broke and all alone, but he ain’t ready to come home
He’s gonna be a country singin’ star 
Sometimes she wakes up just thinking of him
She remembers him beside her in the night
While out across those hills that old moon is settled in
And those Carolina stars are shining bright 
Yes he loves you and he’s comin’ home again.

Well the week is gone good people
And Friday’s here at last
I’m going to take my old banjo
Play me a little bluegrass
I’m going were the mountains are higher
And the bluegrass is all around
Play me a song for my true true love
Listen to that mournful sound
Carry me back to the bluegrass
That’s where I long to be
I’m going to take my weary soul
And head down to Torny creek
I long long to see the old folks
I long to see my home
I long to hear from my true true love
And have her all alone
I’ve got a girl she lives down yonder
In a little place called Buffalo
As soon as I get back to her
That’s where I want to go
* Refrain

Carry me back to the mountains
Back beneath the southern sky
Lay me to rest in the mountains
There’s where my sweetheart lies
I get so lonesome and weary
No matter where I roam
So carry me back to the mountains
Back to my home sweet home
I was a wild careless youngster
Longing to roam from the start
I left my home in the mountains
And broke my poor darling’s heart
I caught a train at the crossing
And never told her goodbye
Then someone wrote me a letter
And told me my sweetheart had died

As I walked out one morning fair
To view the fields and taste the air
For to view the fields and nettles around
I thought I heard some lonesome sound
O thought I heard my true love say
O do turn and come this way 
You love some other and you don’t love me
You care not for my company
You love some other and I know why
Because he has more gold than I
But gold will melt and silver will fly
My love for you will never die 
There is a flower I’ve heard them say
That can be seen from day to day
And if that flower I only could find
To cure this aching heart of mine 
So fare you well my charming little love
O meet me in that land above
And when we meet there in that land
We’ll take no more this parting hand

Come all you rounders for I want you to hear
The story of a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder’s name
On an eight six-wheeler boys he won his fame
Now the caller called Casey ’bout half-past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He mounted to the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said; “I’m gonna take my trip to the promised land”
 Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
Casey Jones with his orders in his hand
Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
Said;”I’m gonna take tke my trip to the promised land
Pour on the water boys shovel on the coal
Stick your head out the window see the drivers roll
Gonna run her ’til she leaves the rail
‘Cause I’m nine hours late with the western mail
Now Casey passed out of South Memphis on the fly
Heard the firemane say ” Boy you got a white-eye “
The switchman knew by the engine’s moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Now Casey got to that certain place
Old number nine stared him straight in the face
He said to fireman ” Boy you better jump
Cause there’s two locomotives and they’re bound to bump”
Well Mrs. Casey Jones she sat there on the bed
She got the telegram that her poor husband was dead
She said; “Go to bed children and hush your crying
‘Cause you got another papa on the Salt Lake line”

Got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord they put me in the jailhouse, for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict, I was a guilty man
He said forty-five dollars, or thirty days in the can
   And that’ll be cash on the barrelhead, son
   You can take your choice, you’re twenty-one
   No money down, no credit plan
   No time to chase you, ’cause I’m a busy man
Found a telephone number, on a laundry slip
Had a kind-hearted jailer, with a six-gun hip
He let me call long-distance, She said, “Number, please?”
No sooner than I told her, she hollered out at me
   That’ll be cash on the barrelhead, son
   Not part, not half, but the entire sum
   No money down, no credit plan
   ‘Cause a little bird tells me that you’re a traveling man
Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry, my feet a heavy load
Saw a Greyhound a coming, stuck up my thumb
Just as I’d been seated, the driver caught my arm
   That’ll be cash on the barrelhead son
   This old gray dog, gets paid to run
   When engine starts, oh the wheels won’t roll
   That’ll be cash on the barrelhead, I’ll take you down the road

   Mama said don’t go near that river
   Don’t be hangin’ around old catfish John
   Come the morning I’d always be there
   Walking in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn.
Let me dream of another morning
And the time so long ago
Where the sweet magnolias blossom
Cotton fields as white as snow.
Catfish John was a river hobo
Lived and died on the river bend
Lookin’ back I still remember
I was glad to be his friend.
Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Still he never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear.

You should get a medal dear for every broken heart
For every life you’ve ruined cause you think you’re so smart
I never even had a chance and now my life is lost
Once more you’ve had your fun and you don’t care how much it cost
   Oh Chalk up another one, another broken heart
   Chalk up another one, a heart you tore apart
   You picked me for a fool my dear how well I played the part
   Chalk up another one, another broken heart
Broken vows and shattered dreams mean little dear to you
Cause once you said you love me and now you say were through
Well all is fair in love and war I guess you taught me so
Cause in this crazy game of love you hit an all time low
I have only pity in this evil life you choose
This unfair game you’re playing where everyone must lose
But let me tell you something some day you won’t forget
Add me to your collection and you’ll wish we never met

We were waltzing together to a dreamy melody
When they called out change partners and you waltzed away from me
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze upon the floor
And I’ll keep on changing partners ’til I hold you once more
Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment something happened to my heart
So I’ll keep changing partners ’til you’re in my arms and then
Oh my darlin’ I will never change partners again

Dear Nellie since I left the city
I’ve found I’ve changed my mind
I hope you wont think me untruthful
Or do me the least unkind
I think we’re both mistaken
I know you’ll never suit me
I owe my heart to another
Of course kind friends will agree
Please send me my ring and pictures
Also my letters and books
My clothes with many kind wishes
Respectfully yours Charlie Brooks
I heard all about it dear Charlie
I knew it would end this way
I hope you will always live happy
With your loving little wife Miss Gray
Now here’s your ring dear Charlie
Don’t give it to her I pray
Unless you tell her twas once mine
I wore it one year today
One year today dear Charlie
So happy were we both
You vowed you’d never forsake me
But I find you untrue to your oath
Here’s your picture dear Charlie
It’s almost faded away
Because I kissed it so often
And this you can tell Miss Gray
As far as your letters dear Charlie
I burned them as they came
I feared by reading them over
Would cause our love to inflame
I must say goodbye dear Charlie
My letter is near an end
Remember I’m always and always
Forever and ever your friend

Rich girl lives in a big brick house
Poor girl she does the same
My gal lives in the Nashville jail
It’s a brick house just the same
She’ll be coming round the mountain Charmin’ Betsy
She’ll be coming round the mountain Cora Lee poor thing
And if I never see you again
Good gal remember me
Rich girl rides in a Cadilac Eight
Poor girl she does the same
My gal rides in a T-Model Ford
But she gets there just the same
Rich girl wears the best perfume
Poor girl she does the same
My gal don’t wear no perfume at all
But she gets there just the same
Rich girl wears a satin dress
Poor girl she does the same
My gal wears a burlap bag
But she gets there just the same

Once I courted a fair beauty bright,
And on her I placed my whole heart’s delight;
I courted her for love, and her love I did obtain
Do you think I’ve any reason of love to complain?
But when her old father came this for to know
That me and his daughter together would go,
They locked her up and kept her so severe
That I never got sight but once more of Molly, my dear
And then I was forced to her father’s to go
To see whether my true love had forgot me, yes or no,
She made me this reply with the tears all in her eyes
I never will forget you until the day I die
Although they keep me so tightly confined
But that is no reason I shall alter my mind,
I might have had a man and a man of high degree
But I always will prove kind to the man that loves me
Then I was forced to the army to go
To see whether I could forget my love or no;
But when I got in sight with my armor shining bright
It made me think of Molly, my heart’s delight
Then seven long years I served one old king
At the end of seven years I returned home again
With my heart so full of grief and my eyes so full of tears
Oh how happy I’d a-been to got sight of my dear
O then I was forced to her father’s to go
To see whether my true love had remained, yes or no
The old woman saw me come, she wrung her hands and cried
Said,” Sir, my daughter loved you, and for your sake she died”
O then I was struck like a man that was slain
The tears from my eyes fell like showers of rain,
My grief, my grief, it is more than I can bear
My true love is in her grave and I wish I was there

There’s a fairground down in Chattanooga
Where a kiddie train runs up and down the track
There’s an old black hound with his tongue hanging down
And he chases the train down the track
I’ve been chasing you like a Chattanooga Dog
Even tho’ I know you don’t care
I’ve been chasing you like a Chattanooga Dog
And it ain’t a-gonna get me nowhere
I’ve been thinking that you’re just like that old train
If anybody gets a ticket they can ride
I’m like that hound pup
I won’t never give up
I’ll do anythihg to sleep by your side
Everyday when the kiddies come for playing
To ride that old kiddie train once more
There’s an old faithful hound that always hangs around
And he runs ’til his feet get sore

   Don’t go so far away love, try to stay around
   For losing you would be more than I could bear
   Though I’m tied to another, I hope someday she’ll set me free
   For I don’t want a cheap love affair
I knew we loved each other the night that we first met
It just happened there was nothing we could do
Let me stay with my children ’til they can understand
That I love them and they’ll know I love you too
So darling please forgive me don’t give me all the blame
Though’ I know that it doesn’t seem so fair
When I’m free I’ll make you happy if you’ll only wait for me
But I don’t want a cheap love affair

Mama sent me to the spring, she told me not to stay
I fell in love with a pretty little girl, and could not get away
Chawing chewing gum, chewing chawing gum
Chawing chewing gum, chewing chawing gum
First she give me peaches, next she give me pears
Next she give me fifty cents, kissed me on the stairs
Mommy don’t ‘low me to whistle, poppy don’t ‘low me to sing
They don’t ‘low me to marry, I’ll marry just the same
I wouldn’t have a lawyer, I’ll tell you the reason why
Every time he opens his mouth he tells a great big lie
I wouldn’t have a doctor, I’ll tell you the reason why
He rides all over the country and makes the people die
I wouldn’t have a farmer, I’ll tell you the reason why
Because he has so plenty to eat, ‘specially pumpkin pie
I took my girl to church last night How do you reckon she done?
She walked right up in the preacher’s face and chewed her chewing gum

Oh childish love I could not hold
I thought your love was a pot of gold
But you can write a few short lines
And tell your love ten thousand times.
You left me in this world alone
Your childish heart I could not win
You tore apart our little home
A childish love will always end.
When you have wed another man
I hope he’ll give his life to you
I hope he’ll always treat you kind
Just like I did when you were mine.
There’s just one thing I have not told
Your picture framed in a ring of gold
I’ll always wear it on my hand
The diamond sealed in a golden band

Since you went away, dear, I’ve been so alone
You’ve left me the children, but you’ve broken up our home
But you couldn’t stop your cheating and running around
Now everybody’s talking about how you let them down
   My heart it is aching, you should be ashamed
   The children are crying and calling your name
Oh, Mommy, oh, Daddy, I think that it’s a shame
I know you both love me, but I don’t know who’s to blame
But you couldn’t stop your cheating and running around
Now everybody’s talking about how you let them down

Children go where I send Thee (Oh lordy)
How will I send thee
Oh I’m gonna send thee one by one
For one was a little bitty baby born,
Children born in Bethlehem
Two was Paul and Silas
Three was the Hebrew children
Four was the four that stood at the door
Five was the five that came back alive
Six was the six that didn’t get picked
Seven was the seven that never got to heaven
Eight was the eight that waited at the gate
Nine was the nine that stood in the line
Ten for the ten commandments

There’s a quiet and peaceful county in the state of Tennessee
You will find it in the book they call Geography
Not famous for its farming its minin’ or its stills
But they know there’s chittlin’ cookin’ in them cheatham county hills
   When it’s chittlin’ cookin’ time in cheatham county
   I’ll be courtin’ in them cheatham county hills
   And I’ll pick a cheatham county chittlin’ cooker
   I’ve a longin’ that the chittlin’s will fill
There’s an art in chittlin’ cookin’ and all good chittlin cooks
They must master it by practice cause it ain’t reknowned in books
In the hills of cheatham county in sunny Tennessee
When chittlin’s are in season is where I long to be
Of all good things put be for me
I think chittlin’s are the best
And when I press that dying pillow
Let chittlin’s by my last request

Back up in the mountains in that old home town of mine
There’s not a brighter time of year than that of Christmas time
The bells in the little churchthey all begin to chime
Telling all for miles around Rejoice! It’s Christmas time!
Christmas bells are ringing I hear the times so sweet
The carolers are singing; I hear them in the street
Outside the white snow falling inside my heart I find
A world of joy and peace on earth back home at Christmas time
A candle in each window; they give a golden glow
While out among the shimmering pines lights sparkle in the snow
And through the lonely mountaintops the wind’s shrill echoes cry
For peace on earth good will toward men and faith that will not die
High above our little town so bright to be so far
There shines upon the whole wide world His gift our guiding star
Everyone in each home can feel a peace sublime
And know the joy the Yuletide brings to all at Christmastime

Snowflakes falling my old home is calling
Tall pines are humming Christmas time is coming.
 Can’t you hear them bells ringin’ ringin’ joy to all here them singin’
Let it snow and I’ll be going back to my country home
Christmas times a’ coming Christmas times a’ coming
Christmas times a’ coming and I know I’m going home.
Holly’s in the window home where the wind blows
Can’t walk for running Christmas time is coming.
Home fires burning my heart’s yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time is coming.

There’s a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovelier place in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dell
   Oh, come to the church by the wildwood
   Oh, come to the church in the dale
   No spot is so dear to my childhood
   As the little brown church in the dell
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To list to the clear ringing bell
It’s tones so sweetly are calling
Oh, come to the church in the dell
There, close by the church in the valley
Lies one that I love so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the dell
There, close by the side of that loved one
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymn shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb

Lord I been hangin’ out of town in that low down rain
Watchin’ good time Charlie friend is drivin’ me insane
Down on shady Charlotte Street the green lights look red
Wish I was back home on the farm in my feather bed.
   Get myself a rockin’ chair
   To see if I can lose
   Them thin dime hard times
   Hell on Church Street blues.
Found myself a picker friend who’s read yesterday’s news
Folded up page twenty-one and stuck it in my shoe
Gave a nickle to the poor my good turn for the day
Folded up my own little folder threw it far away.
Lord I wish I had some guitar strings Old Black Diamond brand
I’d string up this old Martin box and go and join some band
But I guess I’ll just stay right here just pick and sing a while
Try to make me a little change and give them folks a smile.

You ought to see my Cindy she lives way down south
She’s so sweet the honey bees swarm around her mouth
 Get along home Cindy Cindy
Get along home Cindy Cindy
Get along home Cindy Cindy
I’ll marry you some day
The first I seen my Cindy she was standing in the door
Her shoes and stocking in her hand her feet all over the floor
She took me to her parlor she cooled me with her fan
She said I was the prettiest thing in the shape of mortal man
She kissed me and she hugged me she called me suger plum
She throwed her arms around me I thought my time had come
Oh Cindy is a pretty girl Cindy is a peach
She threw her arms around my neck and hung on like a leech
And if I was a sugar tree standing in the town
Each time my Cindy passed I’d shake some sugar down
And if had a needle and thread fine as I could sew
I’d sew that gal to my coat tails and down the road I’d go
I wish I was an apple a-hanging on a tree
Every time that Cindy passed she’d take a bite of me

A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky-tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that’s gay and bright
But it’s just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
But God who put the stars above I don’t believe made those lights
For it’s just a place for men to cry when things don’t turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

How sadly we miss the folks around the fireside
The ones that have crossed the great chilling tide
No crepes will be hung on the doorknob of heaven
And Jesus will lay your burdens aside
    A beautiful light will guide me to heaven
    A beautiful home where we’ll never grow old
    It’s circle complete we’ll have a reunion
    A handshakin’ time in that city of gold
Satan will try to lead you astray
Do all in his power to guide you his way
Don’t let temptation guide your poor soul
There’s only one way seek Jesus today

   I’m climbing up the mountain and I’m going home
   Climbing up the mountain going stone by stone
   Climbing up the mountain when my work is done
   Climbing up the mountain to the sky
Moses freed his people from the pharaoh’s hand
Forty years they wandered through the desert sand
Led them out of Egypt to the promised land
And then he climbed on up to the mountain to the sky
Martin helped his people in a powerful fight
Led them in the struggle for the civil rights
Birmingham to Selma leading black and white
And then he climbed on up to the mountain to the sky
Each of us is given heaven’s work to do
Doesn’t take more courage than is granted you
Eye upon the prize and you can see it through
And then you’ll climb up on the mountain too

Livin’ up on top of the mountain
Livin’ up where the hills are steep
Got no home ain’t got no place to sleep
Got no place to sleep
Roll on roll on Clinch Mountains
Roll on you old Clinch Mountain blues
I can’t lose these Clinch Mountain blues
These Clinch Mountain blues
Goin’ back to mother and daddy
Goin’ back to see them both someday
When I’m there it’s there that I’ll stay
There that I will stay
Travelin’ down this old rocky road
Travelin’ down this road to find my way
Back to the old folks and my home so gay
My home so gay
Leavin’ right now yes I’m leavin’
Packin’ up clothes but I’ve none to pack
Leave these Clinch Mountains and I ain’t a-comin’ back
I ain’t a-coming back

You’ve gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you’re close by
Years have passed you’ve not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you’ll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I’ll sleep ’till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close by

Turn around
don’t whisper out my name
For like a breeze it might stir a dyin’ flame
I’ll miss someone if it eases you know
So close the door lightly when you go.
Take your tears to someone elses eyes
They’re made of glass and they cut like wounding lies
Memories are drifting like the snow
So close the door lightly when you go.
   Who was the one who wasted time
   Who was the one who stole my mind
   Who was the one who made me feel unkind
   So fare thee well sweet love of mine
Don’t look back to where you once had been
Look straight ahead if you’re walking in the rain
And find a life if the path is dark and cold
And close the door lightly when you go.

Dark clouds hangin’ over me
When will they go away
Rain is in my eyes and I can’t see
Life’s become just cloudy days
Why she done me like she done
I guess I’ll never know
She knows I need her more than anyone
I made a point to let it show
   Cloudy days don’t the sun ever shine anymore
   Stormy weather will you always be around
   When I’m down I can’t stand cloudy days
I recall a time when times where good
Lord it seems so long ago
But you know they say if the rain won’t come
The grass’ll have no chance to grow

My old hen’s a good old hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes 8 and sometimes ten
That’s enough for the railroad men
   Cluck old hen cluck and sing
   You ain’t laid an egg since late last spring
   Cluck old hen cluck and squall
   Ain’t laid an egg since late last fall
Cluck old hen cluck when I tell you
Cluck old hen or I’m gonna sell you
Last time she cackled cackled in the lot
Next time she cackles cackle in the pot
My old hen she’s a good old hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes 1 sometimes two
Sometimes enough for the whole damn crew

Some blues are just blues, mine are the miner’s blues
Some blues are just blues, mine are the miner’s blues
My troubles are coming by threes and by twos
Blues and more blues, it’s that coal black blues
Blues and more blues, it’s that coal black blues
Got coal in my hair, got coal in my shoes
These blues are so blue, they are the coal black blues
These blues are so blue, they are the coal black blues
For my place will cave in, and my life I will lose
You say they are blues, these old miner’s blues
You say they are blues, these old miner’s blues
Now I must have sharpened these picks that I use
I’m out with these blues, dirty coal black blues
I’m out with these blues, dirty coal black blues
We’ll lay off tomorrow with the coal miner’s blues

Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put those rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn’t have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewin’ every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
When she sewed she told a story from the Bible she had read
‘Bout a coat of many colors Joseph wore again
she said Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn’t wait to wear it Mama blessed it with a kiss
   A coat of many colors that my mama made for me
   Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
   I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
   With my coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Now with patches in my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughin’ and makin’ fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
Now I did not understand it for I felt almost rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
Then I told them all the stories mama told me while she sewed
How my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They did not understand it though I tried to make them see
That one is only poor if they choose to be
I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

It’s an old familiar story of a boy and a girl
And a love that went wrong from the start
How Bobby he loved Mary and she thought she love’d him
But she found she had a cold cheater’s heart
And that life out on the farm Ain’t what she had in mind
When she promised to honor and obey
So she took to runnin’ ’round all over town
Ain’t it funny how life turns out that way
The years have tumbled by Bobby turned an ol’ blind eye
To the things he hoped just weren’t true
And then came that fateful day when he had been away
Oh they say he came home just too soon
He found them lyin’ there oh it was more than he could bear
He found a gun she cried don’t be rash
But two shots filled the air he stood right there and stared
The deed was done it was over in a flash
That old judge looked down and sighed he said Bobby you’ll have to die
The law is clear and it must take it’s toll
Think on the deed you’ve done your race on earth is run
And may God have mercy on your soul
On a cold November morn in a prison so forelorn
The warden prayed as did the parson too
And the crowd gathered there they heard him loud and clear
His final words were Mary I love you
It’s an old familiar story of a boy and a girl
And a love that went wrong from the start
How Bobby he loved Mary and she thought she love’d him
But she found she had a cold cheater’s heart

I tried so hard my dear to show that you’re my every dream
Yet you’re afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A mem’ry from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn’t do
In angerunkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
You’ll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you’re afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain’t smart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

passing by a lonesome graveyard
everything i love is gone
weeping as they lay my darling
neath a cold gray tomb of stone
in this world i`m left to wander
with no one to call my own
while my precious darling`s sleeping
neath a cold gray tomb of stone
out there in that lonesome graveyard
she is sleeping all alone
and i burried my heart with her
neath a cold gray tomb of stone
skies above are dark and stormy
all the sunshine,all is gone
for the while my love is sleeping
neath a cold gray tomb of stone
my heart is dead and yet i`m living
traveling through this world alone
i wish that i was with my darling
neath a cold gray tomb of stone

That rain is fallin’
that cold hard rain It’s fallin’

You left me my darlin’

   I don’t think that I can go on
   Woke up this mornin’

That rain is fallin’
that cold hard rain It’s fallin’
it’s fallin’ on my window tonight
You left me my darlin’
with all this pain Darlin’
you left me all alone tonight
And now it’s fallin’
that cold hard rain It’s fallin’
it’s fallin’ on my window tonight

All you need is time
All you need is time time time to make it bend
Give it a try don’t be rude
put it to the test It’ll give it right back to you
It’s cold on the shoulder
and you know that we get a little older every day
Take it around

Try to defy what you feel inside
You better be stong your love belongs to us
It’s cold on the shoulder
and you know that we get a little older every day.
All you need is is trust
An you need is trust trust trust
to make it show
I want to know everything you’ve done
if you get a tent tell it to the eskimo
It’s cold on the shoulder
and you know that we get a little older every day.
All you need is faith
All you need is faith faith faith
to make it nice
Kick it around don’t be rude

It’s cold on the shoulder
and you know that we get a little older every day.
It’s cold on the shoulder
and you know that we get a little older every day.

   What’s that knockin’ at my door
   Hard times (hard times) (hard times)
   What’s that blowin’ in my window
   Cold wind (cold wind) (cold wind)
   Let the cold wind blow and the hard times roll
   Ain’t gonna worry no more.
Now summer’s gone and winter times a’ comin’
And the cold winter winds gonna blow
You should come on home and 1 wouldn’t be alone
Wouldn’t have to worry any more.

It’s been ten years and three since I first went to sea
Since I sailed from old Ireland and home
But those hills lush and green were a part of my dreams
When I dreamed of my Colleen Malone
On the day I returned to my sorrow I learned
That the angels had called her away
To a grave on a hill overlooking the mill
That’s the place where she’s sleeping today
   As the soft breezes blow through the meadow I go
   Past the mill with the moss covered stone
   Up the pathway I climb through the woods and the vines
   To be with my Colleen Malone
She was faithful each day as I sailed far away
There was no one but me that she loved
I remember those eyes soft and blue as the skies
And her heart was as pure as a dove
All the years of my life I will not take a wife
I will live in this valley above
Planting flowers around in this soft gentle ground
That is holding my Colleen Malone

Way down in Columbus, Georgia
Want to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends all turned their backs on me
   Go and leave me if you wish to
   Never let it cross your mind
   If in your heart you love another
   Leave me little darling, I don’t mind
Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke I was mistaken
I was peering through the bars
Many a night with you I’ve rambled
Many an hour with you I’ve spent
Thought I had your heart forever
Now I find it’s only lent

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They’re like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they’re gone
They’ll tell to you some loving story
And they’ll make you think that they love you well
And away they’ll go and court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell
I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I’d write a letter to my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
And when he’d ask, I would deny
Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it’s new
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew

Tonight as I sit by my window
I’m reading your letter so true
I’m hoping to find it in your letter
Where you say I’ll come back to you.
   Oh come back to me little darlin’
   I miss you each day and each night
   Oh come back to me little darlin’
   Don’t leave me alone all my life
I know I can never be happy
No matter whatever I do
I know it’s harsh and lonely without you
Oh won”t you come back and be true.
Oh what will I do without you
My life is so lonely and blue
No matter what happens my darlin’
I just can’t forget loving you.

Oh, I’m sending a prayer up to Heaven
On a beautiful cloud you see
So you will know that I want you
In my beautiful memories and dreams
   Come back to me in my dreams love
   Come back to me in sweet dreams
   I’m heartbroke I’m sad and I’m weary
   Come back to me in my dreams
When the bright moon shines up in Heaven
And the beautiful stars are a’gleam
It seems that you are so near me
But yet it is only a dream
It seems I’ll never more see you
Till we meet in Heaven it seems
But I hold you close to my heart love
In my beautiful memories and dreams

Come go with me to yonder valley
Where we once stood beneath the tree
Where we once planned our life together
I can’t forget come go with me
Come let us live some moments over
Then maybe you won’t want to leave
I love you then and will forever
I can’t forget come go with me
I can’t forget the flowers blooming
The rose that I pick for you
Time changed you but I’m not changing
I loved you then and I still do
Come go with me to yonder valley
Where on the largest of the trees
I’ll carve your name to prove I love you
I can’t forget come go with me
I love you then and I still do

Come walk with me down lover’s lane
Where we once walked together
For old time sake I’m asking of you dear
Then I’ll go away forever
I think of the life we could have together
And relive the past they wouldn’t make last
So come walk with me down lovers lane
Then I’ll go away forever
This little band of gold I’ll keep it forever
As a token of a love that never could be
It’s the story of my life the past with no future
And all that is left is a sad memory

I know that I hurt you and I’m confessing
Since you’ve been gone I’m feeling mighty low
Please let me hear from you don’t keep me guessing
I need you more than you could ever know
Now I’m to blame I treated you unkind
I broke your heart and now you’re breaking mine
I know I done you wrong and I’m confessing
Please take me back and try me one more time
How could I ever think I’ll love another
The way I treated you it was a crime
You are the only one I love no other
Please take me back and try me one more time

The wind through the night is blowing so lonesome
Singing to me a song
A whippoorwill call is just a reminder
Pretty girls have hearts made of stone
   I’ll wake with the blues at dawn
   My darling Cora is gone
   I don’t know why she told me goodbye
   But my darling Cora is gone
The ring that she wears I bought for her finger
Purchased her raiment so fine
Gave her my last green back dollar
And now she’s left me behind
Drifting along like a brush on a river
Caring not where I roam
Going to live in a deep forest
Dark hollow will be my new home

Corina Corina where you been so long
Corina Corina where you been so long
I ain’t had no lovin’ since you’re been gone.
I love Corina tell the world I do
I love Corina tell the world I do
Just a little more lovin’ let your heart be true
Corina Corina what’s the matter now
Corina Corina what’s the matter now
You won’t write me no letters you don’t love me no how
Goodbye Corina it’s fare you well
Goodbye Corina it’s fare you well
When I’ll get back any one can tell.

Do you remember Long time ago
Daddy worked a man called Cotton Eyed Joe
Daddy worked a man called Cotton Eyed Joe
I could have been married long time ago
If it hadn’t ‘a been for Cotton Eyed Joe
If it hadn’t ‘a been for Cotton Eyed Joe
Old bull fiddle and a shoe-string bow
Wouldn’t play nothin’ but Cotton Eyed Joe
Wouldn’t play nothin’ but Cotton Eyed Joe
Play it fast or play it slow
Didn’t play nothing but Cotton Eyed Joe
Didn’t play nothing but Cotton Eyed Joe
Where do you come from where do you go
Where do you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
Where do you come from Cotton Eyed Joe
Come for to see you come for to sing
Come for to show you my diamond ring
Come for to show you my diamond ring

I can tell by that far away look in your eye
That you’re waiting for a chance to be leaving
Where did I go wrong did I stay away too long
Did something come between us I don’t understand.
   I will run to where you are going
   Any place you’re yearning to roam
   But there’s something there you’re not showing
   Could it be you don’t love me anymore
   Could it be you don’t love me anymore.
With this sweetest song
I would borrow the sun
And light up the world for you and me
Seems we’ve only just begun
you’re already on the run
And I didn’t even know the race was on.

Could you love me one more time
With a love that really is mine
I’ve waited so long they say you’ve gone wrong
Have I lost you forever this time
   We’ll go down by the river
   I’ll ask you one last time
   As the night breezes blow I’ll whisper so low
   Could you love me one more time
Do you think that I’d believe
This talk that’s going around
I’ve heard lots of things that somehow seem strange
But darling I wouldn’t throw you down
I know that you’re my weakness
I know you’ll be my downfall
I’m not sorry we met and I’ll never forget
That I gave you my heart soul and all

Taking me for granted was your first mistake
And that was the beginning of my last heartache
And then you added insult to my injury
When you started treating me just as you please
   Count me out of future plans you might be making
   No more foolish chances am I taking
   You played love’s game too rough, as for me I’ve had enough
   ‘Cause the going’s got too rough so count me out
Things I thought important never bothered you
And you kept on ’till you killed all my love for you
Doing as you pleased became a part of you
And you can’t blame me now for walking out on you

He was just a lonely cowboy
With a heart so brave and true
He learned to love a maiden
With eyes of heaven’s own blue
They learned to love each other
And named their wedding day
When a quarrel came between them
And Jack he rode away
He joined a band of cowboys
An tried to forget her name
But out on the lonely prairie
She waits for him the same
One night when work was finished
Just at the close of day
Someone said sing a song Jack
Twill drive those cares away
When he reached the prairie
He found a new made mound
His friends they sadly told him
They’d laid his loved one down
They said as she was dying
She breathed her sweetheart’s name
And asked them with her last breath
To tell him when he came
Your sweetheart waits for you Jack
Your sweetheart waits for you
Out on the lonely prairie
Where the skies are always blue

One beautiful night when the moon was full
And the air was crisp and clear
A cowboy lay on the star lit plain
And thought of his home so dear
He thought of his mother he loved so well
And his slumber of sleep was blurred
Not a sound to be heard but throws of the night
As he sang a wild song to his herd
The cattle are lying so quite and still
On a carpet that mantles the west ?
While the golden lanes from the sky of night
Sing peace to the cowboys stress ?
Still he thinks of his mother in a far away land
And his thoughts by his memory was stirred
And he steals himself the old home again
As he sang a wild song to his herd
He’s far from the din of the city noise
Where the lanes of folly do shine
He’s far from the jaws of the dies sin ?
And the flow of sparkling wine
He’s in the great west with its mantle of green
Where his neighbors say never a word
A land of marriage of mountains and plains
Where a cowboy sings low to his herd

   You get a line and I’ll get a pole honey
   You get a line and I’ll get a pole babe
   You get a line and I’ll get a pole
   And we’ll go down to the Crawdad hole
   Honey sugar baby mine.
Get up old man you slept too late honey
Get up old man you slept too late babe
Get up old man you slept too late
Last piece of crawdad’s on your plate
Honey sugar baby mine.
Get up old woman you slept too late honey
Get up old woman you slept too late babe
Get up old woman you slept too late
Crawdad man done passed your gate
Honey sugar baby mine.
Along come a man with a sack on his back honey
Along come a man with a sack on his back babe
Along come a man with a sack on his back
Packin’ all the crawdads he can pack
Honey sugar baby mine.
What you gonna do when the crawdads die honey
What you gonna do when the crawdads die baby
What you gonna do when the crawdads die
Sit on the bank until I cry
Honey sugar baby mine.
I heard the duck say to the drake honey
I heard the duck say to the drake baby
I heard the duck say to the drake
There ain’t no crawdads in this lake
Honey sugar baby mine.

   Crazy heart I wish I didn’t love you
   And I could turn around and walk away
   I’ve only got a half a mind to leave you
   Your crazy heart is driven’ me insane
Like a wild east wind so uncertain
You’re changing like the weather everyday
One night we’re in love the next I’m hurting
Your crazy heart is driven’ my insane
Now I only want a love that I can count on
And hold to the promises you made
How can it feel so right and then go so wrong
Your crazy heart is driving me insane

I got a girl and she loves me
She’s as sweet as sweet can be
She’s got eyes of baby blue
Makes my gun shoot straight and true.
   Goin’ up Cripple Creek goin’ in a run
   Goin’ up Cripple Creek to have some fun.
Cripple Creek’s wide and Cripple Creek’s deep
I’ll wade old Cripple Creek before I sleep
Roll my breeches to my knees
I’ll wade ol’ Cripple Creek when I please
I went down to Cripple Creek
To see what them girls had to eat
I got drunk and fell against the wall
Old corn likker was the cause of it all

I walked out tonight for a ramble round
I didn’t mean to stay just to view the town
When I saw her smiling from afar
As she walked into that crossroads bar
Well I walked inside and sat me down
Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it down
She came and set beside me there
With a dark brown eyes and the red, red hair
I told her that I loved her true
Anything you want I’ll surely do
Said a man like you don’t get too far
With a girl like me at the crossroads bar
I like smoky light and a lonesome song
And I won’t do right if I can do wrong
You want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
And you won’t find love at the crossroads bar
Come all my friends and take my advice
Keep your love at home with your lovely wife
You’re better off than you think you are
And you won’t find love at the crossroads bar

Cry cry darling
That’s what I’ll do If you should leave me with the blues
Cry cry darling
That’s all I do cause you’re the one that’s in my heart
   For me there’ll be no moonlight
   If ever we should part
   Cry cry darling, that’s all I do
   Cause you’re the one that’s in my heart
Cry cry darling
My eyes will cry and never dry if you should go
Cry cry darling
When shadows creep I’ll just weep all night I know
   You know how much I’d miss you
   If ever we should part
   Cry cry darling
   That’s all I do cause you’re the one that’s in my heart

One morning in Jerusalem about the break of dawn
A great trial was in session, they tried our blessed lord
They scorned him and they mocked him, they made him carry the cross
On top of Calvary mountain, they crucified my Lord
   Oh the cry (Jesus cried) from the cross
   Forgive him blessed father, he died upon the cross
   Oh the cry (Jesus cried) from the cross
   The son of God was dying, to save the world from loss
Saint Peter he denied him at that awful trial at night
He said he never new him, it was an awful sight
He looked upon Saint Peter with eyes of perfect love
Saint Peter’s heart was broken, he prayed to God above
Crying father it is finished then he bowed his head and died
The world was left in darkness, the graves were open wide
An earthquake shook Jerusalem the dead walked into town
The multitudes were frightened, God’s wrath came pouring down

Crying the blues
I’m crying because I have lost you
Blues I can’t lose
I guess it’s too late now to try
I’ve tried to chose another to love but it’s no use
Crying heart blues there’s nothing that’s left but to cry
I’ll always remember I love you
My teardrops won’t let me forget
Each tear is a wish to be near you
They started the day that we met
A trail of tears will lead you to me if you want me
And from my hopeless my crying heart flees

Lord I ain’t no stranger now
Lord I ain’t no stranger now
I’ve been introduced to the Father and the Son
Lord I ain’t no stranger now
   Cryin’ holy unto the Lord
   Cryin holy unto the Lord
   Lord if I could I surely would
   Stand on that rock where Moses stood
Sinners run and hide your face
Sinners run and hide your face
Run to the rocks and hide your face
The rocks won’t have no hiding place

Oh somewhere the music’s playing soft and low
And a stranger holds the one that I love so
I was blind I could not see that you meant the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go
   Now I’m crying my heart out over you
   Those blue eyes now they smile at someome new
   Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
   For I’m crying my heart out over you
Each night I climb the stairs up to my room
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom
I miss your picture on the wall and your footsteps in the hall
While I’m crying my heart out over you.

   Crying holy unto the Lord
   Crying holy unto the Lord
   If I could I surely would
   Stand on the rock where Moses stood 
Lord I ain’t no stranger now
Lord I ain’t no stranger now
I’ve been introduced to the Father and the Son
Lord I ain’t no stranger now 
Sinners run hide your face
Sinners run hide your face
Sinners run to the Lord and hide your face
Lord cried out “No hiding place”

Far away in a Spanish dungeon
A Cuban soldier lay
Slowly dying from the torture
Inflicted day by day
He begged to send a message
But this kindness was denied
So he called his comrades to him
And told his story ere he died
   When Cubie gains her freedom
   And the Spaniards cease to reign
   There’s a loved one on that island
   I will never see again
   Oh find her for me comrades
   And tell her you were by my side
   And I bid you take this message
   To a soldiers promised bride
Tis the same old story comrades
Love weeps when beauty is done
When Cubie was struggling for her freedom
I was ordered to my gun
Though I’m a captain dying
The struggle will soon be o’er
Tell her I said to meet me
Where the soldiers fight no more

Well I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And it’s not your fault that I tried to be what I thought you wanted to see
Smilin’ face shinnin’ hair clothes that I thought you’d like me to wear
Made to please and not to tease it’s the custom made woman blues.
Yes I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And I tried to see life your way and say all the things you’d like me to say
Lovin’ looks gentle hands an guaranteed to keep a’ holdin’ your man
Made to please and not to tease it’s the custom made woman blues.
And now you say you’re tired of me and all of those things I thought you wanted me to be
Is it true you want some one who knows how to think and do on her own
Lord it’s hard to realize the lessons I learned so was young were nothing but lies
Made to please and not to tease it’s the custom made woman blues
Made to please and not to tease it’s the custom made woman blues.

Oh listen today and a story I’ll tell,
In sadness and tear rimmed eyes,
Of a dreadful cyclone that came this way,
And blew our schoolhouse away
: Rye Cove (Rye Cove), Rye Cove (Rye Cove),
The land of my childhood and home,
Where life’s early morn I once loved to roam,
But now it’s so silent and lone
When the cyclone appeared it darkened the air,
And the lightning flashed over the sky,
And the children all cried, don’t take us away,
But spare us to go back home
There were mothers so dear and fathers the same,
That came to this terrible scene,
Searching and crying each found their own child,
Dying on a pillow of stone
Oh give us a home far beyond the blue sky,
Where storms and cyclones are unknown,
And there by life’s strand we’ll clasp the glad hand,
Our children in their heavenly home

In a pawn shop in Odysessa in the fall of ’64
The pawn shop man was leavin’ he was lockin’ up the door
I ran up just in time and I holler’d just through the screen
Hey, man, you got any good guitars in here,
he said “I got this D-18”
So I gave him a hundred dollars and I took that sucker home
I cleaned it up and strung it hit a chord and heard that tone
It was crisp and clean rich and full all a guitar ought to be
I said Thank you, Mr, Martin, you made this D-18 for me
   Said Thank you, Mr. Martin, I’m alright
   ‘Cause once again this old guitar helped me through the night
   I’m mighty grateful to you, you know how to make ’em right
   I said Thank you, Mr. Martin, I’m alright
If I’m feelin’ down and worthless and I haven’t got a dime
Wonderin’ if I spent my life just wastin’ my time
I pick up that old guitar some paper and a pen
I say Thank you, Mr. Martin, you saved my life again.
I’ve written songs about my lovers my family and my friends
My wife my child the old home place and the road that never ends
Heros hobos rock n’ roll and a honky tonk queen
I wrote ’em all without exception on my Martin D-18
Now It was made way back In ’43 when I was just a kid
I believe it’s about the best thing Mr. Martin ever did
It plays real good stays in tune and never treats me mean
Thank God for Mr. Martin and that fine old D-18.
Well there’s your Galagher your Gibson your Goya Gretch and Guild
I’ve played every kind of guitar that them guitar makers build
I’ picked on a lot of axes but the best I’ve ever seen
Is my funky beat up wonderful old Martin D-18.

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there’s a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people that’s all we were
Trying to make a living out of blackland dirt
But we’d get together in a family circle singin’ loud
   Daddy sang bass
   Mama sang tenor
   Me and little brother would join right in there
   Singin’ seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won’t be long
I’ll rejoin them in a song
I’m gonna join the family circle at the throne
No the circle won’t be broken won’t be broken
Bye and bye lord bye and bye
   Daddy sang bass
   Mama sang tenor
   Me and little brother would join right in there
   In the sky lord in the sky
I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin’ for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
I’ll rejoin him in a song
We’ll be together again up yonder in a little while

Oh Daisy Mae my darling oh Daisy Mae
When I’m with you my darling all my cares away
And don’t you know sweet heart that I love you so
Cause you’re my darling precious Daisy Mae
So nice and neat your kisses so very sweet
In my opinion darling you just can’t be beat
And now that I’ve found you no one else will ever do
I’ve tried to make you happy Daisy Mae
You’re everthing you’re every song that I sing
Your lovely little hand looks lovely with that ring
It won’t be long till we hear that wedding song
And you’ll be mine all mine Miss Daisy Mae
How can I wait till we have this final date
And we’ll be married darling that will seal our fate
But laying jokes aside you’ll make a wonderful bride
And I’ll be proud of you my Daisy Mae

I heard about a man one day who wasted not his time away
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the things of man he trusted one who would not fail
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night
   Oh, Daniel served the living God while here upon this earth he trod
   He prayed to God every morning noon and night
   He cared not for the kings decree he trusted God to set him free
   And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night
They cast him in the lion’s den because he would not honor men
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God soon got them
safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night
Now brother, let us watch and pray like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
We too can gladly daring do the things that God will take us through
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

My pocket book was empty
My heart was full of pain
Ten thousand miles away from home
Bumming the railroad train
It was standing on the platform
Smoking a cheep cigar
listening for that next freight train
To carry an empty car
Well I got off at Danville
Got stuck on the Danville girl
You bet your life she’s out of sight
She wore those Danville curls
She took me in her Kitchen
She treated me nice and kind
She got me in the notion
Of bumming all the time
She wore her hair on the back of her head
Like high-tone people do
But the very next train come down the line
I bid that girl adieu
I pulled my cap down over my eyes
Walked down to the track
Then I caught a westbound freight
Never did look back

Where the Walker runs down to the Carson Valley plain,
There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and fair was she
And the sweetest flower that bloomed o’er the range.
Her voice was sweet as the sugar candy
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down.
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shine in the night out of Yerrington town.
She was courted by young Vandermeer
And quite handsome was he I am to hear
He brought her silver rings and lacy things
And she promised to wed before the snows fell that year.
But her pony did stumble and she did fall.
Her dyin’ touched on the heart of us all.
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet to his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall.
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too.
At dusty Sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true.
 

   Dark and stormy weather
   It still inclines to rain
   The clouds hang over center
   My love’s gone away on the train
We met loved and parted
I thought the world of you
You left me broken hearted
To me you proved untrue
I’m leaving old Virginia
There’s nothing here for me
I know you love another
In the grave I’d rather be
You told me that you loved me
I believed just what you said
But now you love another
I wish that I was dead

Dark and stormy is the desert
Through which pilgrims make their way
Yet beyond this vale of sorrow
Lie the fields of endless day
Oh young soldiers are you weary
Of the roughness of the way
Does your strength begin to fail you
And your vigor to decay
Jesus Jesus will go with you
He will lead you to his throne
He whose thunder shapes creation
He who bids the planets roll
Around him are ten thousand angels
Ready to obey his command
They’ll all be there to hover round you
Til you’ve reached the heavenly land
There on flowery hills of pleasure
Lie the fields of endless rest
Love and joy and peace forever
Reign and triumph in your breast

Dark and thorny is the desert
Through which pilgrims make their way
But beyond this vale of sorrow
Lie the realms of endless day
Dear young soldiers do not murmur
At the troubles of the way
Beat the tempest fight with courage
Never faint but watch and pray
He whose thunder shakes creation
He that bids the planets roll
He that rides upon the tempest
And whose sceptre sways the whole
Jesus Jesus will defend you
Trust in him and him alone
He has shed his blood to save you
And will bring  you to his throne
There on flowering fields of pleasure
And the hills of endless rest
Joy and peace and love shall ever
Reign and triumph in your breast
There ten thousand flaming seraphs
Fly across a heavenly plain
There they sing immortal praises
Glory Glory is their theme
See the heavenly host in rapture
Gazing on the shining bands
Wondering at their costly garments
And the laurels in their hands
There upon the golden pavement
See the ransomes marched along
While the splendid courts of glory
Sweetly echo in with their song
Here I see the undershepherds
And the flock they’ve led below
Here with joy they dwell together
Jesus is their shepherd now
Hail you happy happy spirits
Welcome to the blissful plain
Glory honor and salvation
Reign sweet Jesus ever reign

Come and listen, young fellers, so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mines
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul
‘Til the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
   Where it’s dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
   Where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few
   Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
   It’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mines
There’s many a man who I’ve known in my day
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope or a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines 
Well I hope when I’m gone and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner that’s digging my bones

Dark as the night and blue as the day
I’m lonesome my darling since you went away
Sometimes I wonder what made you stray
Dark as the night and blue as the day.
 Blue as the sky there’s blues in my heart
Yes it’s dark outside since we’ve been apart
Oh tell me please tell me why did you stray
Dark as the night I’m blue as the day.

I once had a dark haired true lover
She was all this world to me
She promised herself to another
Now don’t you think this was mean
   Take back every word you have spoken
   Let it be as though we never met
   For tonight I’m a poor boy heartbroken
   I’ll forgive but I’ll never forget
I was young when I wrote my first letter
I blotted the lines with tears
But now I am old I know better
We parted for many long years
Oh Ruth, Oh Ruth how I love you
You just seem to me like a bird
Although you went back on your promise
Although you went back on your word
We parted in the month of September
Some said we parted for life
But I hope someday or another
I’ll call you my sweet darling wife
I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
For I’m out in this wide world a wandering
I’m tired of living alone

I’d rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don’t ever shine
Than to be home alone knowing that you’re gone
Would cause me to lose my mind
   So blow your whistle freight train
   Carry me further on down the track
   I’m going away I’m leaving today
   I’m going but I ain’t coming back
I’d rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don’t ever shine
Than to be in some big city
In a small room with you love on my mind

   A dark road’s a hard road to travel
   A light road is always the best
   A dark road will lead you to trouble
   A light road will lead you to rest
I’m going to see my new jail tomorrow
It’s a place I have never been before
And when my woman comes tomorrow
I’ll meet her with a smile at the door
Don’t ever be downhearted
Where there’s a will there’s a way
Tomorrow the sun may be shining
Although it is cloudy today
Don’t this road look dark and lonesome
Don’t the sea look blue and deep
Will you ever think of me darling
When you can not hear me speak

I don’t need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain
Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue
If I lost you to another think I’d drown down here for sure
Won’t you stay with me and be my only cure
   Dark skies may cloud my days but that don’t bother me
   As long as I can hold you close to me
I don’t need a part-time lover to leave me in the cold
With empty arms to hold when I need you
Tell me that there is no other send the cold wind from my door
Give you all of my love and more if you want me to

   The darkest hour is just before dawn
   The narrow way leads home
   Lay down your soul at Jesus’ feet
   The darkest hour is just before dawn
The sun is slowly sinking
The day is almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on
Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A watching the sheep down below
He’s coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go

Darlin do you know who loves you
Do you know whose heart you won
I’ll be lonely here without you
When these parting words do come
Take me back to my old country
Let me hear the lonesome dove
Where a blue eyed girl is waiting
For this mountain boy to love
Can’t you see the sun a sinkin’
Over the mountains over the sea
Where the days will last in memory
It may be the last of me
Take me back to Roanoke valley
Gently lay me down to rest
Place a kiss upon my forehead
For I’m the boy who loves you best

There’s a low, green, valley on the old Kentucky shore
Where I’ve whiled many happy hours away,
Just a sitting and a singing by the little cottage door
Where lived my darling Nellie Gray 
When the moon had climbed the mountain, and the stars were shining too
Then I’d take my darling Nellie Gray
And we’d go floatin down the river in my little red canoe
While my banjo sweetly I would play 
One night I went to see her, but she’s gone the neighbors say
And the white man had bound her with his chain
They have taken her to Georgia for to wear her life away
As she toils in the cotton and the cane 
   Oh, my poor Nellie Gray, they have taken you away
   And I’ll never see my darling, anymore
   I’m sitting by the river and a weeping all the day
   For you’ve gone from the old Kentucky shore 
Now my canoe is under water, and my banjo is unstrung
I am tired of living, anymore
My eyes shall be cast downward, and my songs will be unsung
While I stay on the old Kentucky shore 
Now I’m getting old and feeble, and I cannot see my way
I can hear someone knocking on my door
I can hear the angels singing, and I see my Nellie Gray
So farewell to the old Kentucky shore 
   Oh, my darling Nellie Gray, up in heaven, so they say
   And they’ll never take you from me, anymore
   I’m coming, coming, coming, as the angels clear the way
   So farewell to the old Kentucky shore

The moon was shining last night
You’re many miles from my side
As the train rolls on I’m thinkin’ of home
And my little darlin’ brown eyes
My little darlin’ don’t cry
You’re little darlin’ brown eyes
You’re mine you’re mine to love all the time
You’re my little darlin’ brown eyes
The train was on the fly
I watched the stars in the sky
The break of dawn and the hills of home
You’re my little darlin’ brown eyes
I’ve come back darlin’ brown eyes
I’ve come back darlin’ don’t cry
Back to stay never to stray
You’re my little darlin’ brown eyes

Wake up wake up darling Corey
What makes you sleep so sound
The revenue officers are coming
They’re gonna tear your still-house down.
Well the first time I seen darling Corey
She was sitting by the banks of the sea
Had a forty-four around her body
And a five-string on her knee.
Go away go away darling Corey
Quit hanging around my bed
Your liquor has ruined my body
Pretty women gone to my head.
Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
Dig a hole in the cold damp ground
Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
We’re gonna lay darling Corey down.
Can’t you hear them bluebirds a-singing
Don’t you hear that mournful sound
They’re preaching darling Corey’s funeral
In some lonesome graveyard ground.

   Wake up wake up darling Corey
   What makes you sleep so sound
   The revenue officers are coming
   They’re gonna tear your still house down
Well the first time I seen darling Corey
She was sitting on the banks of the sea
Had a forty-four around her body
And a banjo on her knee
Go away go away darling Corey
Quit hanging around my bed
Your liquor has ruined my body
Pretty women gone to my head
Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
Dig a hole in the cold cold ground
Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
Gonna lay darling Corey down
Can’t you hear those bluebirds a singing
Don’t you hear that mournful sound
They’re preaching darling Corey’s funeral
In some lonesome graveyard ground
Wake up wake up Darlin Corey
And go get me my gun
I ain’t no man for fightin’
But I’ll die before I run

When first I met my darling daisies
Down by the garden wall
I was walking along the street so shady
I was going for a twilight call
   I love to sing and dance among the roses
   Down by the garden wall
   Tis there I’d like to meet my daisies
   When I make a twilight call
She was sleeping in a bed of roses
Dreaming of the by and by
While the little birds around were singing
Up above the branches so high
If you want to see a bright eyed beauty
Bright as the stars that shine
Just come and go with me some evening
To see this pretty girl of mine

Oh the night was dark and stormy
When this message came to me
It was from my darlin’ Nellie
Who had sailed across the sea
 I was wanderin’ through the grave yard
When I found where Nellie lay
It was there my heart was broken
It was there I knelt to pray
But remember; darlin’ Nellie
There’s a home for us on high
I will meet you darlin’ Nellie
When they lay me down to die

Oh the night was dark and stormy
When this message came to me
It was from my darling Nellie
Who is far across the sea
 Oh dear Jack I know I’m dying
I’ve no friends or parents nigh
But remember dearest Jackie
There’s a home for us on high
Oh dear mother I must leave you
I must go across the sea
I must find my darling Nellie
Who so dearly cared for me
 I was wondering through the grave yard
When found where Nellie lay
It was there my heart was broken
It was there I knelt and prayed
Now I’m left alone in sadness
On the fields the flowers wave
And the girl I love is sleeping
In the cold and silent grave
 Lay me where my Nellie’s sleeping
Close beside her let me lie
Where the blooming flowers are creeping
There oh lay me when I die

You told me that you loved me and always would be mine
But now you’ve gone and left me with troubles on my mind
Everybody told me that our love wouldn’t last
There’s nothin’ in my future so I’m living in the past
Tear drops heart ache
I knew that our love wouldn’t last
Lonely worried
Darling I’m living in the past
Some day I know your new love is gonna let you down
But I’ll be waiting for you I’ll still be around
Now you’re free and happy living much too fast
While I’m blue and lonely and living in the past

So early on that morning, the moon still way up high
The moon still way up high
Though soon enough the sun would warm the colors of the sky
I lay awake I could not sleep or even close my eyes
And dear you seemed so restless too I should have realized
The house was dark the moonlight was inviting and so strange
I went out by the window to watch the morning change
And just before the break of dawn and bird began to sing
And somehow then it came to me just what the day would bring
   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   I know you tried to make me see and no I never would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood
A stray old cat did walk the fence outside my window bed
He stopped and looked my way and then he went without a care
And I wondered when he’d ramble back or why he ever should
But I knew that he was just like you and that he never would
   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   Those words you spoke now ring so true just like you said they would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood

I once did have a dear companion
Indeed I thought his love my own
Until a dark eyed girl betrayed me
And then he cares no more for me
Just go and leave me if you wish to
It will never trouble me
For in your heart you love another
And in my grave I’d rather be
Last night you were sweetly sleeping
Dreaming in some sweet repose
While I, a poor girl, broken hearted
Listened to the wind that blows
When I see your babe a laughing
It makes me think of your sweet face
But when I see your babe a crying
It makes me think of my disgrace

Oh, the fields were turning brown all around that southern town
The boy came down the highway all alone
And his face was looking sad, he was thinking of his dad
And his mother that he left at home sweet home
   Dear old mother how I miss you
   How I long for your sweet face and sunny smile
   I would give up all I own just to be with you at home
   And to linger there for just a little while
Oh, the morning glory vine around the cabin door would twine
And the mockingbird would sing along the tree
Then we’d take our dear old book and go down beside the brook
And there for hours she’d sit and read to me
Now I’m in this world alone, the old folks are not at home
They’ve gone up to a happier home above
The mockingbirds are singing yet and I never will forget
My mother and dad were all I had to love

At the end of day when works all over
And the shadows of night settle down
My thoughts turn back to the one that loved me
My sweetheart and my home town
There’s a dear one dear one waiting
Waiting back in my home town
It’s a sweet one called my missess
Waiting back in my home town
We once walked to church on Sunday morning
All of our friends gathered round
I will meet her again to be wed at the altar
When I get back to my home town

Soon one morning death came creeping in my room
Soon one morning death came creeping in my room
Soon one morning death came creeping in my room
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
Death’s done come and took my Mother away
Death’s done come and took my Mother away
Death’s done come and took my Mother away
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
Death’s done come and took my Father away
Death’s done come and took my Father away
Death’s done come and took my Father away
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
Ride on, Death ’cause you can’t do me no harm
Ride on, Death ’cause you can’t do me no harm
Ride on, Death ’cause you can’t do me no harm
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)

Sadly we sing and with tremulous breath
As we stand by the mystical stream
In the valley and by the dark river of death
And yet ’tis no more than a dream 
   Only a dream, only a dream
   Of glory beyond the dark stream
   How peaceful the slumber, how happy the waking
   Where death is only a dream 
Why should we weep when the weary ones rest
In the bosom of Jesus supreme
In the mansions of glory prepared for the blessed
For death is no more than a dream 
Naught in the river the Saints should appall
Though’ it frightfully dismal may seem
In the arms of our Savior no ill can befall
They find it no more than a dream 
Over the turbid and onrushing tide
Doth the light of eternity gleam
And the ransomed the darkness and storm shall out ride
To wake with glad smiles from their dream

Where is my sailor boy
Oh where is my sailor boy
He lies on the bottom of the deep deep sea
And he can’t come back to me
Please tell me deep blue sea
Is he sleeping peacefully?
The wind from the north is blowing icy cold
Please keep him warm for me
   What does the deep sea say
   Oh what does the deep sea say
   It moans, it groans, it flashes and it foams
   And rolls on its weary way
I stand on the beach alone
And gaze at the misty blue
Deep sea as you hold him to your breast
Does he mention my name to you
If only my dreaming soul
Some token of love could find
If only a wave would show my where he sleeps
Then I’d leave this world behind
A beautiful rose one day
I placed on the crest of a wave
Deep sea take it please
And lay it so it falls above his watery grave
The driftwood I watched in vain
My rose never came back again
Deep sea take another message to my love
Saying I’ll meet him above

When you go down in Deep Elem
Just to have a little fun
Better have fifteen dollars
When that policeman come
   Oh sweet mama
   Daddy’s got them Deep Elem blues
   Oh sweet mama
   Daddy’s got them Deep Elem blues
When you go down in Deep Elem
Put you money in your pants
Those Deep Elem women
They don’t give a man a chance
When you go down to Deep Elem
Put your money in your socks
Them Deep Elem women
They will throw you on the rocks
I used to know a preacher
Preached the bible through and through
He went down to Deep Elem
Got them Deep Elem blues
Now once I had a sweetheart
Meant the world to me
Went down to Deep Elem
She ain’t what she used to be

You’re running wild deep river
You’re just like the one that I love so
You never stop running deep river
Like her you’re always on the go
   Hey I’m feelin’ low down deep river
   I can’t go on I’ve had enough
   I’m gonna dive to your bottom deep river
   I’m divin’ in but I’m not comin’ up.
Now if I had a big boat deep river
I would have you rock me to sleep
And some where down the stream I’d anchor
In the port of broken dreams

   Let it rain let it pour
   Let it rain a whole lot more
   ‘Cause I got them deep river blues
   Let the rain drive right on
   let the waves sweep along
   ‘Cause I got them deep river blues.
My old gal’s a good old pal
And she looks like a water fowl
when I get them deep river blues
Ain’t no one to cry for me
And the fish all go out on a spree when
I get them deep river blues.
Give me back my old boat
I’m gonna sail if she’ll float
cause I got them deep river blues
I’m goin’ back to Mussel Shoals
Times are better there I’m told
cause I got them deep river blues.
If my boat sinks with me
I’ll go down don’t you see
cause I got them deep river blues
Now I’m gonna say good-bye
‘N if I sink just let me die
cause I got them deep river blues.

I’m drifting into deep water
I’m starting to care for you
And you’re getting me in deep water
Be careful what you do.
You want a romance
and I’m sick in love
I know I’ll regret it when it ends
I’m drifting into deep water
Why can’t we still be friends.
It’s so restless in this deep water
And I’m caught between right and wrong
My love’s as true as deep water
Your love won’t last that long.
Where will it lead me and when will it end
I can’t help but wish I only knew
And I’m drifting into deep water
So deep in love with you.
I’m winding up in deep water
So deep in love with you.

Lord I have strayed to far from my home
And the ones who are waiting for me there
I long to hear them singing the songs I love so well
Callin’ me back home to Delware
Oh Delware keeps on callin me
what I wouldn’t do to be there
For I’m weary of the road and I feel so all alone
And I long to be home in Delware
Yes I long to be home in Delware
And in the night I dream of the place I call home
And the geese flyin’ high up o’r the lake
And the mournin’ doves callin’ in the evenin’ of the day
But I’m far far away when I awake

Headed down life’s crooked road
Lot of things I never knowd
Cause I didn’t know I now pine
Trouble got in the trail
Spent the next five years in jail
Should have read that Detour sign
 Detour there’s a muddy road ahead
Detour paid no mind to what is said Detour
Oh these bitter things I find
Should have read that Detour sign
When I’ve got to the place
Where it said “a-bout face”
I thought that all my worries were behind
But the farther I go
More sorrow I know
Should have read that Detour sign
When I’ve got stuck in the mud
All my hopes dropped with a thud
My life seemed to pass before my eyes
Got no will power to get
From the hole that I’m in yet
Should have read that Detour sign
Should have read that Detour sign

She’s the devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She’s telling dirty lies
She’s the devil in disguise in disguise.
Now a woman like that all she does is hate you
She doesn’t know what makes a man a man
She’ll talk about the times that she’s been with you
She’ll speak your name with everyone she can.
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her soul is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her up to see a person crying
She’s just the kind that you can live without
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
Well it’s all right to call her but I’ll bet you
The moon is full and you’re just wasting time.

While walking out one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we gave the show 
I met a little salvation band
Singing with all its might
I gave my heart to Jesus
And left the show that night 
   The day will soon be over
   And begging will be done
   And no more gems be gathered
   So let us all press on 
   Till Jesus comes to claim us
   And says it is enough
   The diamonds will be shining
   No longer in the rough 
While reading through the Bible
Some wondrous sights I see
I read of Peter, James and John
By the Sea of Galilee 
And Jesus when he found them
He found them very tough
and they were precious diamonds
He gathered in the rough

There’s an old ramshackle shack where in dreams I wander back
And listen to the southern melody
T’was the place where I was born on a bright October morn
And it’s nestled at the end of my river of memories
Did you ever go sailing down the river of memories
To the little log cabin that’s nestled among the sycamore trees
Where the sunshine is cheery and nothing in the world grows dreary
That’s my cabin at the end of my river of memories
There’s a mother old and gray at the end of memory’s way
I’ll meet her there tonight among the trees
With a smiling welcome she so sweetly beckons me
To the cabin at the end of my river of memories
When the twilight shadows fall many childhood voices call
Back again to the days that used to be
And in answer to their prayer I will soon be sailing there
To the cabin at the end of my river of memories

Go to sleep you little baby
Go to sleep you little baby
Your momma’s gone away and your daddy’s gone to stay
Didn’t leave nobody but the baby
Go to sleep you little baby
Go to sleep you little baby
Everybody’s gone in the cotton and the corn
Didn’t leave nobody but the baby
You’re a sweet little baby
You’re a sweet little baby
Honey in the rock and the sugar don’t stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby
Don’t you weep pretty baby
Don’t you weep pretty baby
She’s long gone with the red shoes on
Gonna meet another lovin baby
Go to sleep you little baby
Go to sleep you little baby
You and me and the devil makes three
Don’t need no other lovin baby
Go to sleep you little baby
Go to sleep you little baby
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever lovin baby

He drank whiskey for his liver
smoked cigarettes for his lungs
He loved women for his ego
he died a rounder at twenty-one
He never worked down at the saw mill
he couldn’t stand that hot sunshine
He had twenty-one years of real life
he lived a thousand in that time
One night when the blues had got him
he must have drank three fifths of rum
He got mean as hell when I told him
he’d never live past twenty-one
Well if a man ever hit me harder
well I don’t know where or when
He picked me up off that old bar floor
he said I’d like to be your friend
One night I heard him talkin’
to an old man at the bar
He said Dad, you know I love you,
I just don’t like where you are
Tell Mama to turn my light on,
turn down my feather bed
I’ll be twenty-one tomorrow
but tomorrow he was dead.
It was twenty-one miles to the graveyard
twenty-one roses red
Told the story of the rounder
who at twenty-one he was dead
He drank whiskey for his liver
smoked cigarettes for his lungs
He loved women for his ego
he died a rounder at twenty-one.

I just pulled on to the highway in my little foreign car
Well it’s raining and the road is really bad
I never saw that big old diesel but I heard him hit the air
I’ve got a feeling that I might have made him mad
He closed the gap between us pushed the pedal on the floor
He’s makin’ ninety in that big old diesel truck
I can hear the names he’s calling me above the engine’s roar
And the words won’t be found in Webster’s books
There’s a diesel on my tail a-making ninety miles an hour
My reflection in my mirror is mighty pale
I can hear St.Peter calling I can almost smell the flowers
Can this compact take the impact there’s a diesel on my tail
Well I’m huffin’ and puffin’ and I’m trying to make the grade
And I wish I had some pedals on this cart
And I’m slippin’ and a-slidin’ and afraid to touch the brake
For the two of us could never stand the jar
Well I’m slippin’ and a-slidin’ trying to hold it on the road
And I tell you I just got to win this race
While I’m tremblin’ and a-shakin’ he is pouring on the coal
So close that I can steal his license plate

Dig dig a little deeper in the well boys
Dig a little deeper in the well
If you want a good cool drink of water
You gotta dig a little deeper in the well.
My daddy used to tell me don’t be fooled by what you see
If you want to get to the heart of things you gotta look way down deep
Second place don’t get it son winners got to come in first
There’s nothin’ worse than to take a drink that leaves you with a thirst
A good man needs a good womanshe’s the rock that’ll make him strong
Now she’ll be there to lean on when the whole world’s done him wrong
Ain’t nothin’ like good lovin’ that’s how it’s meant to be
Find yourself a good woman son like your mama’s been to me.
The mighty river’s flowin’ where the water’s cool and sweet
Don’t be fooled by a muddy dream be careful when you drink
Life is what you make it sometimes a livin’ hell
If you want to find that promised land dig a little deeper in the well

   Dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music
   Is the only kind of life you’ll ever understand
   Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
   You’ll never make a wife to a home-loving man
A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
You’d rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
And the only home you’ll know is the club down the street
A drinking and dancing to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life you’ll ever understand
Go out and have your fun, you think you’ve played it smart
I’m sorry for you and your honky tonk heart

I remember very well on one dark and dreary day
Just as I was leaving home for a distant land to roam
   Mother said (mother said) my dear boy (my dear boy)
   I hope to see you next year again
   Fare you well (fare you well) fare you well (fare you well)
   So I left my dear old home for a distant land to roam
Now I wandered far away from my home I’ve gone astray
Now I’m coming coming home never more from thee to roam
And these words she said to me as she took me by the hand
If on earth we meet no more may we meet at God’s right hand

I’m dreaming tonight of Dixie
That’s where I like to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day
In my Dixie home sweet home.
Oh the people here they just don’t care
I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long
But it’s Dixie Land for me
I was going back to my old home
In the mountains far away
The wild red roses smell so sweet
And the rippling waters play
Yes city life is not for me
Or knowing where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mighty long
But it’s Dixie Land for me

Last night I heard those nightbirds calling
Brings back memories of days gone by
It makes me think of you my darling
And do you wonder why
Do you wonder why I love you
After what you did to me
Why oh why do I think of you
But I do It’s plain to see
In all my dreams of our life together
I think of you and then I sigh
I just don’t know what makes me love you
And do you wonder why
And now that we have parted strangers
We have said our last goodbye
I can’t forget I love you truly
And do you wonder why

Oh the cold wind blows outside my window
The dark clouds linger up above
The bright side of my life has faded
For I may lose the one I love
   After all our years together
   And I cherished every day
   Oh darling won’t you please consider
   Does it have to end this way
Oh come up closer to me darling
Let me gaze into that face
Where once a vision sweet contentment
A bitterness has took it’s place

Now honey you know you ain’t living right
You sleep all day and you’re gone all night
Dog bite your hide little hide dog bite your hide
Like a black cats back you’re full of fire
You’re always jumping here and there
Dog bite your hide little hide I hope you’re satisfied
Now all the things that you have done
Has killed my soul made my spirits run
Dog bite your hide little hide dog bite your hide
And if you don’t stop your playing around
I’m gonna tear your ash hopper down
Dog bite your hide little hide then I’ll be satisfied
Now honey you think that you’re just it
Cause you made me have a running fit
Dog bite your hide little hide dog bite your hide
But my craw is full I’m leavin’ you
My gizzard’s cracked I’m feelin’ blue
Dog bite your hide little hide then I’ll be satisfied
I’m gonna tear your reputation down
Gonna cut a wide swath for miles around
Dog bite your hide little hide dog bite your hide
Then I’m gonna stand around and laugh
When you roll your eyes like a dying calf
Dog bite your hide little hide then I’ll be satisfied

You’ve been stepping out on me
I’m gonna leave ’em at your feet
You’re no good but I don’t care
Ain’t that a shame a Dog gone shame
Every time I leave town
People say you’re stepping round
You’re no good but I don’t care
Ain’t that a shame a Dog gone shame
I’ll set you in the shade
Give you everything I made
You’re no good but I don’t care
Ain’t that a shame a Dog gone shame
I’ve done all that I can do
To try and get along with you
You’re no good but I don’t care
Ain’t that a shame a Dog gone shame
Ain’t that a shame a Dog gone shame

I went downtown thought I had a dime
Got home this morning didn’t have a dime
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin’ I got the dog house blues.
Come home this morning about half past eight
She said honey you’re out too late
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin’ I got the dog house blues.
I went in the house to start the fire
She kicked me out in the middle of the night
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin’ I got the dog house blues.
I fell in the yard mad as I can be
Said to my dog make room for me
Lordy Lordy Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talkin’ I got the dog house blues.

On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call be by a number not a name, Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and worried mind
When that old judge looked down and smiled
He said I’ll put you on that good road for a while, Lord Lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind
You can hear my hammer you can hear my song
I’ll swing it like John Henry all day long, Lord Lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind
It won’t be long, just a few more days
I’ll settle down and quit my rowdy ways Lord Lord
with that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She’ll be waiting for me when I’ve done my time

If our love should fade like a cold winter day
Don’t blame it all on me
Their true love has flown I have known friends will say
Don’t blame it all on me
There was a time dear when we were so gay
I heard you say love only you
But some day with the dawn all our love may be gone
Don’t blame it all on me
Now you left and know all our love is so wrong
Don’t blame it all on me
For there was a time when our love was a song
Don’t blame it all on me
For after all dear I too have a heart
You have it now don’t break it apart
Someday our romance may break up just by chance
But don’t blame it all on me
You just can’t go on with no smile in your heart
Don’t blame it all on me
Our friends they all say that we too soon must part
Don’t blame it all on me
Now if you’ll change dear I will change too
And maybe then we’ll find love anew
Someday with the dawn all our love may be gone
But don’t blame it all on me

Don’t bother to cry cause I ain’t lookin’
Don’t bother to sigh cause I won’t hear
You told me a lie and I believed you
Tho’ you’re cryin’ you are still lying dear
Weep no more my lady
Oh weep no more and moan
Save your teardrops baby
Cause your Daddy’s lovin’ heart has turned to stone
Don’t tell me your lies if I should leave you
Don’t pull at your hair it won’t help at all
You did it before and fooled my heart dear
Now you might as well talk to the wall
Don’t bother to cry cause I ain’t lookin’
Don’t bother to sigh cause I won’t hear
I played the game fair but you’ve been cheatin’
As you sow so you’ll reap so sorry dear
Weep no more my lady
Oh weep no more and more
Save your teardrops baby
Cause your Daddy’s lovin’ heart has turned to stone

Tonight my heart is beatin’ low and my head is bowed
You’ve been seen with my best friend on the other side of town
I don’t mind the waitin’ don’t mind the runnin’ around
But if you’re gonna cheat on me don’t cheat in our home town.
 How can I stand up to my friends and look em’ in the eye
Admit the questions that I know would be nothin’ but lies
You spend all your pastime makin’ me a clown
But if you’re gonna cheat on me don’t cheat in our home town.
Now there are no secrets in this little country town
Every one knows every one for miles and miles around
Your bright eyes and your sweet smile are drivin’ me insane
You think it’s smart to break my heart and run down my name.

I know you loved him a long time ago
And even now in my mind you still want him I know
But darling this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight don’t close your eyes
 Don’t close your eyes let it be me
Don’t pretend it’s him in some fantasy
Darlin’ just once let yesterday go
You’ll find more love than you’ve ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don’t close your eyes
Baby I’ve been a fool holdin’ on all this time
Lyin’ here in your arms knowin’ he’s in your mind
But I keep hoping some day that you’ll see the light
Let it be me tonight don’t close your eyes

Just cry now lonesome heart but don’t cry to me
You let her go I told you no
And my words you didn’t need
Yes cry now lonesome heart
But don’t cry to me
    You should have known you’d be alone
    So don’t beg for sympathy
    Just cry now lonesome heart
    But don’t cry to me
    Her love you won’t forgot
    The pain you caused her you’ll regret
    Each day you’re gonna miss
    Her smile her touch her kiss

   Don’t do it and it won’t be on your mind
   Just because you are the reckless kind
   It’ll leave you with the blues the kind that you can’t lose
   Don’t do it and it won’t be on your mind
If you’re thinkin’ about steppin’ out tonight
Even tho’ your baby treats you right
It’s not the thing to do cause cheatin’ leaves you blue
Don’t do it and it won’t be on your mind
That little girl who lives across the way
She’s bound to make you want to cheat some day
You’ll want to hold her tight kiss her ruby lips goodnight
Don’t do it and it won’t be on your mind

   Hey bartender
   Pour a round for me
   I can’t go home it’s getting’ late
   My baby don’t love me
All you boys gather round
if whiskey rules your life
Stay out of bars and ol’ pool halls
and marry you a wife
Trouble Trouble
will find you anyway
You’re bound to die a drunkard’s life
if you don’t mind your ways
I had a girl she loved me true
I was livin’ way to fast
Now I live in a whiskey dream
my end has come at last
One more thing I’ll tell you
If you life gets out of hand
Don’t drink from a whiskey bottle
You’ll die a lonely man

You are the one the one that I live for
I’d die if we were apart
My thoughts are with you when we’re not together
Don’t ever leave me darlin’ don’t ever break my heart.
 Don’t ever leave me darlin’
I’d die a million times
Your love means more than life to me
Yes I love you can’t you see.
My thoughts wander back to the day I first saw you
I saw that you were the one
That was ten years ago and now I’m even fonder
Don’t ever leave me darlin’ or I’ll be all alone

Wildcat Kelly was lookin’ mighty pale
Standin by the sheriff’s side
When that sheriff said I’m taking you to jail
Wildcat raised his head and cried
 Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
don’t fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open spaces that I love
don’t fence me in
I want to be by myself in the evening breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
don’t fence me in.
Just turn me loose and let me wander over yonder
where the purple mountains rise
On my kayoose let me straddle my old saddle
underneath the western skies
I want to ride to the range when the west commences
Howl at the moon ’til I lose my senses
I won’t look at hobbles and I can’t stand fences
don’t fence me in

At my window sad and lonely
Often do I think of you
And I wonder little darling
If you’re thinking of me to 
   Don’t forget me little darling
   When from you I’m far away
   But remember little darling
   We may meet again someday 
You may meet with fairer faces
Some may tell you I’m not true
Don’t believe them little darling
No one loves you as I do

My home’s in old Virginia among the lovely hills
The memory of my birthplace lies in my bosom still
I did not like my fireside I did not like my home
I have a mind for rambling so far away from home
It was on one moonlight evening the stars were shinning bright
And with an ugly dagger I made the spirits fly
Twas then the sobber struck me as plain as you can see
I’m doomed I’m ruined forever throughout eternity
I courted a fair young lady her name I will not tell
Oh why should I disgrace her when I am doomed for hell
But now upon my scaffold my time’s not very long
You may forget the singer but don’t forget this song

Now I got a gal that’s sweet to me,
But she just ain’t what she used to be
Just a little high headed; That’s plain to see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me. 
Now looky here gal don’t you high head me
For I ain’t forgot how you used to be
When you didn’t have nothin’ That was plain to see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me. 
You need not hold your head so high
Every time you pass me by
For that don’t mean nothin To me you see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me. 
Now looky here gal you’d better be yourself
And leave that other stuff on the shelf
You’re a country baby That’s plain to see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me

Don’t fall in love with me darling I’m a rambler
   Although you’re the sweetest sweetheart in this world
   It’s all for your sake dear that I’m leaving
   Don’t give your heart to a rambler little girl
I’d never had the blues my little darling
Or the lure of the road on my mind
I’m bound to hear the whistle of a freight train
And the boxcars as they rattle down the line
Yes I handed you a line and I’m sorry
You’re just a little sweeter than the rest
Believe me when I say don’t want to hurt you
Or do anything to mar your happiness

   Don’t fall in love with me darling I’m a rambler
   Although you’re the sweetest sweetheart in this world
   It’s all for your sake dear that I’m leaving
   Don’t give your heart to a rambler, little girl
I handed you a line dear and I’m sorry
You’re just a little sweeter that the rest
Believe me when I say I don’t want to hurt you
Or do anything to mar our happiness
If I’d never had the blues, little darling
Or the lure of the road, dear on my mind
But I’m bound to hear the whistle of a freight train
And the boxcars as they rattle down the line

   Now don’t go out tonight little darling
   Do not leave me here alone
   Stay at home with me my darling
   I’m so lonesome while you’re gone
I hear a knockin’ at my door
And a footstep on the floor
Now they’re bringin’ home my darling
Here he lies drunk upon the floor
Now he’s dying yes he’s dying
Soon I’ll be left all alone
I pray that God’s warm tender mercy
Will save him from a drunkard’s doom

If I cry when I kiss you or when we say goodbye
Don’t laugh don’t laugh
If I say I’ll always love you and I will ’til I die
Don’t laugh don’t laugh.
 I could never find another there’s no need for me to try
So I beg of you my darlin’ please don’t laugh if I cry
If I say I’ll always love you and I will until I die
Don’t laugh don’t laugh.
Honest darlin’ I’m not teasing when I say you are the best
Don’t laugh don’t laugh
And if you will take the chance I’m sure my love will stand the test
Don’t laugh don’t laugh.

Don’t let Smokey mountain smoke get in your eyes
If you do I’m tellin’ you
You’ll wan’t to live there the rest of your life
If Smokey mountain smoke gets in your eyes
If you’re looking for a place you will love
Smokey mountain Cherokee
The closest place to Heaven that I know of
Smokey mountain Tennessee
Gattlinburg precious jewel the mountain treasure
Smokey mountain paradise
You’ll want to live in the smokies forever
If Smokey mountain smoke gets in your eyes

Well, I’ve been all around this whole wide world
Been down to sunny Alabam
My mama always told me, Son
Never let your deal go down
   Don’t let your deal go down
   Don’t let your deal go down
   Don’t let your deal go down
   Till your last gold dollar is gone
Well, the last time I seen that gal of mine
She was standing in the door
She said honey I’ll be a long time gone
You’ll never see your gal no more
Well, I’m going sown the railroad track
Gonna take my rocking chair
If there doggone blues don’t leave my mind
I’m gonna run away from here

Don’t let your sweet love die like flowers in the Fall
Don’t take away the smile and leave the tears
My heart believes in you, please say you love me too
Don’t leave me here to face the lonely years
I drifted all alone, no one to call my own
and then you came like an angel from the sky
You said we’d never part, don’t leave and break my heart
Be mine alone, don’t let your sweet love die
When flowers fade away they’ll bloom again some day
Will you love me when the rosebuds open wide
Or is your kiss to be only a memory
I need you so, don’t let your sweet love die
Don’t let your sweet love die like flowers in the Fall
Without you life would seem like death to me
I’ve grown so used to you, I can’t believe we’re through
Don’t say goodbye, don’t let your sweet love die
I need you so, don’t let your sweet love die

There stands a rose down in your garden
You left it there so all alone
It’s been neglected feels unwanted
Since no love to it is shown
 
It’s beauty now is fastly fading
Once it was the brightest red
It’s withering fast its head is bowing
And no kind words to it are said
 
Please don’t neglect the rose in your garden
Show it your love every day
Then it will bloom for you in all its beauty
And it will not fade away
 
I guess by now you know my story
Don’t neglect a love that’s true
For it may prove to be the sweetest flower
That will ever bloom for you
 
It could be a mother sister or brother
A husband wife or little child
Or it may be your own true lover
That you’ve neglected all the while

We’re gathered in this room today
To say our last goodbye
Friends and kin folk stay away
It’s down to you and I
It’s just a simple service
And much too late to say
Those tender words unspoken yesterday
   Now don’t our love look natural lying there
   You could almost expect it to get right up and care
   It faded in it’s prime and died before it’s time
   Now don’t our love look natural lying there
I know the day our love was born
But i don’t know when it died
I think we could have saved it
But it seems nobody tried
A love like time can slip away
And vanish with the dawn
And you can’t bring it back
No When it’s gone

You have no doubt in your mind
there’s a heaven up above
And you mean to change before the end
But you hold onto treasures
you possessed here on earth
Feasting your soul on sin
   Don’t put off ’til tomorrow what you can do today
   For tomorrow may be too late
   Sinner give your heart to Jesus won’t you kneel down and pray
   For tomorrow may be too late
You say you’ll change tomorrow
but tomorrow never comes
These words you keep repeating everyday
How sad will be the story
when you’re laid in your grave
In torment forever you will pay
There’s a wreck on the highway
there’s blood on the road
That lifeless body lies cold
They’ll never know Jesus
they’ve waited too long
They’ll never live in that heavenly fold

They tell me today you are going
Far away just to make you a name
They tell me that you’re discontented
And that you are search-ing for fame
   Don’t say goodbye if you love me
   For ‘twould make my heart overflow
   Kiss my lips once ere you leave me
   Just don’t say goodbye when you go
Somehow I can’t realize we’re parting
I have grown used to having you near
The strings in my heart love are breakin’
I just can’t say good-bye to you dear
Each night as I kneel by my bedside
I will pray one sweet prayer for just for you
I will ask of the kind one in heaven
Just to make all your dreams dear come true

   Don’t sell the land Mama
   Please don’t sell the land
   My heart’s in these hills Mama
   please don’t sell the land
My Daddy he was born here, here in these hills
My Daddy’s lying quiet now but he’s with us still
Mama on your wedding day Daddy brought you here
Held you safely in his arms and promised his last share
I’ll help you pay the taxes we still have some time
I’ll farm that little furrow I’ll work down in the mine
I know how hard it is Mama with eleven kids to feed
But we can still make it Mama if you will hear my plea
Don’t worry about my schooling don’t need it anyhow
I’ve got to fill my Daddy’s shoes and I plan to start right now
I know you carried it all alone so Mama lean on me
We’ve lost the most important thing but we built a family

All the things that we have done together
All the joys and sorrows that we’ve shared
Made me feel our love would last forever
Now I know you never really cared
Don’t step over an old love
To get somebody new
Don’t step over an old love
Who always has been true to you
When my back was turned he caught your fancy
And he turned an innocent affair
Into something more than just a friendship
While my dreams all crumbled in despair
Now you think you’re happy with your new love
You don’t think he’s been untrue to you
Wait until you hear the whole town talking
Than you’ll feel these heartaches like I do

Darling, I have come to tell you
Though it almost breaks my heart
But before the morning darling
We’ll be many miles apart 
   Don’t this road look rough and rocky
   Don’t that sea look wide and deep
   Don’t my baby look the sweetest
   When she’s in my arms asleep 
Can’t you hear the night birds crying
Far across the deep blue sea
While of others you are thinking
Won’t you sometimes think of me 
One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
Darling you have broke my heart

You say you’ll never be my wife cause you’ve done wrong in life
And from it all your heart is bruised and torn
But God will forgive you and darlin’ I will too
But let me love you Don’t throw your life away
He used your heart for his fun now the damage has been done
Don’t wish that you had never been born
For the mistake has been made your love’s too sweet to waste away
But let me love you Don’t throw your life away
He treated you mean and cheap and your heart I know was deep
A rose you found was full of deadly thorns
He dragged your name beneath his feet and now he shuns you on the street
But let me love you don’t throw your life away
Come into my waiting arms we’ll fight life’s bitter storms
My loving you I’m not sorry for
And if your love’s not meant for me then wrong I’ll always be
But let me love you don’t throw your life away

Well you said you wouldn’t leave me ’cause you didn’t want to grieve me
And you couldn’t stand to see tears in my eyes
But you said you loved another and it ain’t like he’s your brother
So I guess it’s time for me to realize
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
Well I think that I’ll surrender you keep looking out the windows
And it’s plain that you don’t love me any way
All you do is walk and piddle while I’m playing second fiddle
I don’t think that I can stand another day
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
For a long time I’ve been knowin’ in your eyes it’s all been showin’
And I knew some day someone would take my place
These cold kisses you’ve been givin’ and the way that we’ve been livin’
There’s enough to make a man start turning grey
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t braggin’
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon

You ran around you had your good times
You said you loved me just the same
When the chips are down and you get lonely
You come running back to me calling my name.
 Don’t you call my name ’cause I won’t answer
Don’t you call my name ’cause I won’t be there
You cheated on me dear for your last time
Don’t you call my name little girl ’cause I don’t care.
I used to cry and wait for you dear
While you played your cheatin’ game
It’s your turn now just keep on cryin’
Can’t hear you cry little girl
don’t you call my name.

Farewell sweetie mine I hate to see you go
Out into the cruel world alone
Hear the bell on that train hear the whistle blow
It’s taking you and leaving me to mourn
   Don’t you see that train dee-dee-dee
   See that train hey hey
   She’s leaving she’s leaving on that train
   Don’t you see that train dee-dee-dee
   See that train hey hey
   And I’ll never see my sweetheart again
I know well I know I did not treat her right
That is why I’m feeling sad and blue
Wo wo wo is me I’m left alone tonight
She’s gone away but I still love her too
Hey hey what a day it’s left me like a rag
Don’t know what to do I feel so bad
Think I’ll take a drink or two to drive my blues away
For if I don’t I’ll die because I’m sad

Dooley was a good old man
He lived below the mill
Dooley had two daughters and a forty gallon still
One gal watched the boiler the other watched the spout
Mama corked the bottles when old Dooley fetched them out
   Dooley, slipping up the holler
   Dooley, trying to make a dollar
   Dooley, give me a swaller and I’ll pay you back some day
The revenuers came for him a slipping through the woods
Dooley kept behind them all and never lost his goods
Dooley was a trader when into town he’d come
Sugar by the bushel and molasses by the ton
I remember very well the day old Dooley died
The women folk looked sorry and the men stood ‘round and cried
Now Dooley’s on the mountain he lies there all alone
They put a jug beside him and a barrel for a stone

Little sweetheart we have parted
from each other we must go
Many miles may separate us
in this world of care and woe
But I can’t forget the promise
that you made me in the lane
When you said we’d be together
when the roses bloom again
 Down among the budded roses
I am nothing but a stem
I have parted from my darling
never more to meet again
But I treasure dear your promise
that you’ll meet me in the lane
Where we’ll always be together;
when the roses bloom again
Now this parting gives me sorrow
and it almost breaks my heart
Tell me darling will you love me
when we meet no more to part
Or will this parting be forever
will there be no coming day
When our hearts will be united
and all sorrows pass away
Darling meet me up in Heaven
that’s my true and earnest prayer
If you love me here on earth dear
then I’m sure you’ll love me there
There our hearts will be united
free from every pain and care
In the land of life eternal
in that city bright and fair

Down at the end of Memory lane
Many have walked it in gladness
I was the one to walk it last
I walked it alone in sadness
I received a letter from my love
Opened it and this is what it said
I am sorry if I hurt you but now it is too late
For another man my darling I have wed
I remember her sweet smiling face
And her little freckled nose
And her golden hair hanging down her back
Tied with a big blue ribbon bow
We were childhood chums together there
I loved her with all my heart and soul
But she married another without a thought or care
And she left me in this world alone and cold
You have heard of the weeping willow
Of that weeping willow tree
And when I die I want you to bury me
Beneath that weeping willow tree
When I’m dead and buried love
Never no more in this world to see
There is one request grant me darling
Won’t you see that my grave is kept clean

   I’m going down down down    going down down down
   I’ve got nobody to love me now
   I’m sorrow bound bound bound since you left this town
   Since you left I’m going down down down.
Now why do I always feel so lonely
And why do I hang my head so low
I love you my darlin’ and you only
Don’t know where you are but there I’ve got to go.
Now what were so many of your reasons
Now could it be you never gave us time
Well in your heart if you desired a new love
If so then your love is not worth mine.

In the shadow of the pines
Lives a girl and I know that she is mine
Life’s worth livin’ any time
Down in Caroline.
It’s no matter where I roam
she’ll be waitin’ there I know
And I’ll find that gal of mine
down in Caroline
She is waiting there for me
Soon her smile I know I will see
She’s all mine where I can be
Down in Caroline
Curly hair and eyes of blue
And a heart of love all for you
And I know her love is true
Down in Caroline
Arms that hold me close and tight
And lips that kiss me goodnight
And I know her love is right
Down in Caroline

Down in the valley valley so low
Hang your head over hear the wind blow
Hear the wind blow dear hear the wind blow
Hang your head over hear the wind blow.
Roses love sunshine violets love dew
Angels in heaven know I love you
Know I love you dear know I love you
Angels in heaven know I love you.
If you don’t love me love whom you please
Throw your arms ’round me give my heart ease
Give my heart ease love give my heart ease
Throw your arms round me give my heart ease.
Build me a castle forty feet high
So I can see him as he rides by
As he rides by love as he rides by
So I can see him as he rides by.
Write me a letter send it by mail
Send it in care of Birmingham jail
Birmingham jail love Birmingham jail
Send it in care of Birmingham jail.

Down in the willow garden where me and my love did meet
There we sat a-courting my love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of burgundy wine which my true love did not know
And there I poisoned that dear little girl down by the banks below
I drew my saber through her which was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river which was an awful sight
My father often told me that money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little miss whose name was Rose Connelly
Now he sits by his old cabin door a wiping his tear-brimmed eyes
Mourning for his only son out on the scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun the devil is waiting for me
For I did murder that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly

Born out in the country raised out on a farm
Got my education out behind a barn
Left one Sunday morning in a driving rain
Hitchhiked to the freight yard and caught the railroad train
Oh, engineer, let your whistle whine
Oh, get me out of here, a little further down the line
I’ve been to California and I’ve been to New Orleans
Been to New York City and everywhere between
I’ve eat beans and taters your finest caviar
Drank brandy from a snifter and moonshine from a jar
Spent a year in prison with a number for my name
Fed me bread and water tied to a ball and chain
I swore the day they slammed the door and the jailer locked me in
If they ever let me out of here I’ll never go back again
Been dreaming of the day when I return back to my home
its where I want to settle down never more to roam
Sit me on a tractor and point me to the fields,
I will plow the furrows my hands upon the wheel

Now down the road just a mile or two
Lives a little girl named Pearly Blue
About so high and her hair is brown
The Prettiest thing boys in this town
Now anytime you want to know
Where I’m going, down the road
Get my girl on the line
You’ll find me there most any old time
Now everyday and Sunday too
I go to see my Pearly Blue
Before you hear that rooster crow
You’ll see me headed down the road
Now old man Flatt he owned the farm
From the hog lot to the barn
From the barn to the rail
He made his living by carrying the mail
Now every time I get the blues
I walk the soles right off my shoes
I don’t know why I love her so
That gal of mine lives down the road
Repeat First then Last

As I went down to the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord show me the way
   Oh sisters let’s go down
   Let’s go down come on down
   Oh sisters let’s go down
   Down to the river to pray

Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord show me the way

And who will wear the robe and crown
Oh Lord show me the way.
Oh (l.brother 2.sister; 3.father; 4.mother; 5.children)
Let’s go down
Come on down won’t you come on down
Oh (l.brother; 2.sister; 3.father; 4.mother; 5.children)
Let’s go down
down to the valley to pray.

Its hard to keep tears out of my eyes
This might be our last goodbye
Our country calls you to defend a great land
So do your part just like a man
   Down where the river bends
   With god’s help we’ll meet again
   Under the same old sycamore tree
   Proud of each other and the land of the free
I go down to the ocean blue
Its just as close as I came to you
This old ocean might keep us apart
But it won’t keep you dear out of my heart
If the worst should happen and the poppies should wave
Over your far distant, lonely grave
All the rest of my life I’ll spend in prayer
I’ll meet you in heaven there’ll be no war there

A miner was leaving his home for his work
When he heard his little child scream
He went to the side of the little child’s bed
She said daddy I’ve had such a dream
   Oh daddy don’t go to the mines today
   For dreams have so often come true
   Oh daddy oh daddy please don’t go away
   For I never could live without you
I dreamed that the mines were all flaming with fire
And the miners all fought for their lives
Just then the scene changed and the mouth of the mine
Was covered with sweethearts and wives
Go down to the village and tell all your friends
That as sure as the bright sun does shine
There’s something a going to happen there today
Oh daddy don’t go to the mine

My life on the road has always been hard on me and you
And everytime we say goodbye it gets harder to do
But when I’m far away somewhere alone and a’ missin’ you starts
All I got to do is picture you and I can feel you in my heart
   So dream of me everytime you get to feelin’ blue
   Dream of me and I’ll be dreaming of you
I’ve been a lot of places but there’s just no place like home
And I’m always on my way back to you every minute that I’m gone
So when you get to feelin’ lonely just remember we won’t always be apart
Close your eyes and think of me you can feel me in your heart
Jim and Jesse McReynolds; Music Among Friends

Dreaming of the arms that held me oh so tight
Dreaming of the smile I cherished day and night
Dreaming of the heart that never will be true
But I guess that’s what I always will do
   Dreaming (dreaming) dreaming (dreaming)
   Dreaming of the love that never will be true
   Dreaming (dreaming) dreaming (dreaming)
   That is what I always will do
Dreaming of the lips that I love to kiss
Dreaming of the charm I never can resist
Dreaming of the word you spoke that wasn’t true
But I guess that’s what I always will do
East Ohio Grass; Remembers Hal James
Doyle Lawson; I’ll Wander Back Someday

In dreams of yesterday I wandered
Back to my little cabin door.
I strolled beside an old rock garden
And saw familiar scenes once more.
I heard the organ softly playing
Its music came so sweet and low.
And I heard my mother sweetly singing
As oft I did so long ago.
   I was dreaming of a little cabin
   And I heard somebody call my name.
   I Looked and saw a sweet old lady
   And it seemed I was a child again.
   She gently put her arms around me
   And kissed her little boy once more.
   I knew it was the same sweet mother
   That had kissed me many times before
I heard her sing the “Rock of Ages”
And “Silver Threads Among the Gold”.
She told me once again of Jesus
Within that little cabin fold.
She opened up her faded Bible
Where the family records used to be
And I knew it was the same sweet mother
That years ago had cradled me.
An orphan through this world I wander
Since mother left the old homestead.
No one to pray for me at twilight
No place to lay my weary head.
I miss her voice so gently calling
I miss her precious guiding hand.
But I know that when I reach God’s city
I’ll hear her call my name again.

I had a dream of you the other night dear
A dream I could not live in true life I fear
You talked with a friend of mine so lovingly
Oh God, oh God a crazy dream please let it be
   Dreams, dreams of you dear
   Tears, tears are so sincere
   Love, love that I can’t hide
   These dreams are breakin’ down all my pride
While music played he danced and held you oh so tight
The same way we did when our love was young and bright
Then he kissed you under lights that were so dim
I couldn’t stand to see you there alone with him
I realize a dream is only fantasy
But tell me why these dreams seem so real to me
Every night I have this same old misery
I guess it’s just because of all my jealousy

Out on the perilous deep
Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You’re drifting too far from the shore
   Drifting too far from the shore
   Drifting too far from the shore
   Come to Jesus today, let him show you the way
   Drifting too far from the shore
Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
Drifting too far from the shore

As my boat draws near the harbor
Knowing soon that you’ll be mine
But if another has you darling
I’ll go drifting with the tide
   I have crossed the great wide ocean
   I have waited for the time
   But if another has you darling
   I’ll go drifting with tide
A long, long time has passed my darling
Since that night you made those vows
I know my heart would break with sorrow
If you should say it’s over now
I’m in love with you my darling
And I’m praying you’ll be mine
But if you change your mind my darlin
I’ll go driftin with the tide

You sit there a-crying, crying in your beer
You say you’ve got troubles, my friend listen here
Don’t tell me your troubles got enough of my own
Be thankful you’re living, drink up and go home
   I’m fresh out of prison, six years in the pen
   Lost my wife and family, no one to call friend
   Don’t tell me your troubles, got enough of my own
   Be thankful you’re living, drink up and go home
Back there sets a blind man, so blind he can’t see
Yet he’s not complaining, why should you or me?
Don’t tell me your troubles, got enough of my own
Be thankful you’re living, drink up and go home

My sweetheart is gone and I’m so lonely
She said that she and I were through
I started out a-drinking for a past time
Driving nails in my coffin over you
   I’m driving nails in my coffin
   Even time I drink a bottle of booze
   I’m just driving nail in my coffin
   Driving nails in my coffin over you
Now ever since the day that we parted
I’ve been so sad so blue
I can’t help thinkin’ about her
And I just can’t quit drinkin’ that old booze
Well you turned me down you don’t want me
There’s nothing more I can do
I’ll be driving nails in my coffin
Worrying’ my darlin’ over you

The crew upon this ship are sailingIs deafened by the ocean’s roarThey are tossed by the mighty breakersToward the rocks upon the shore
 Jesus savior be our captain And guide us through this awful storm And help to save each drowning sailor Who has tumbled overboard
This world is like a grand old oceanThe church is like a ship at seaWe are helpless little sailorsLord we’re helpless but for thee

It was on one dark and starless night
I heard and saw an awful sight
The lighting flashed and the thunder roared
All around the drunkard’s feet
I started home to change my life
To see my long neglected wife
I found her kneeling by her bed
She said our darling baby was dead
I took her by her trembling hand
She was so weak she could not stand
On bended knees I prayed a prayer
That God might save and protect us there
Who preached like Paul who once did say
Our sins have all been washed away
That whiskey stay as far from me
as the mountains are from the deep blue sea

Papa’s name Hannibal Mama was a Hanamurai
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry
We lost it all but only love was left cause that’s the one thing money can’t buy
    Yeah we’re all dustbowl children
    Singing a dust bowl children
    When the crops won’t grow
    And the dust just blows
    When the green fields are gone
    When the green grass growing fields are gone
    When the green fields are gone
    When the green grass growing fields are gone
Well they say in California there’s work of every kind
Well the only job I got out there was waiting in a welfare line
Well once I had a dollar once I had a dream
Now every kind of work is done by great machines

I went to a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all their books and magazines not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible when they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered o’er it not a finger print was plain
   Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
   The words of all our prophets and the sayings of our Lord
   Of all the other books you’ll find there’s none salvation holds
   Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor your soul
You can read your magazines read of love and tragfic things
But not one word of Bible verse not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered o’er it it is sure to doom your soul
If you have a friend you’d like to help along life’s way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible crade the wrong way for the right

Here I lay upon my dying pillow
Around my bed there’s someone getting dark
They are watching the saddest thing that can happen
They are seeing a sinner as he dies
As death’s cold shadow hovers o’er me
To all sinners I plead with my last breath
Don’t shun the work of God that’s what I’ve done
And tonight I’m dying a sinner’s death
No one can know until he faces it
How bad dying a sinner can be
I’m facing it now as I plead with you
Don’t let it be with you as it is with me
My eyes feel so heavy as death claims me
No one can truthfully say I’m going to rest
When you look upon my face please have pity
Yes pity and hope for the best

Lay up nearer brother nearer
For my limbs are growing cold
And thy presence seemeth dearer
When thine arms around me fold
I am dying brother dying
Soon you`ll miss me in your berth
For my form will soon be lying
`Neath the ocean`s briny surf
Tell my father when you see him
That in death I prayed for him
Prayed that I might only meet him
In a world that`s free from sin
Tell my mother God assist her
Now that she is growing old
That her child would glad have kissed her
When his lips grew pale and cold
Listen brother catch each whisper
`Tis my wife I speak of now
Tell oh tell her how I miss her
As the fever burns my brow
Tell her she must kiss my children
Like the kiss I last impressed
Hold them as when last I held them
Held them closely to my breast

On a cold winter’s eve as the snowflakes were falling
In a low humble cottage a poor mother lay
Although wracked with pain as she lay there contented
With her Savior, her Friend and peace with Him made
   We will all meet again on that great Judgment morning
   The books will be open, the roll will be called
   Oh how sad it will be if forever we’re parted
   While some rise to Glory while others stand the Fall
Oh that mother of yours has gone o’er the river
And you promised you’d meet her while knelt by her bed
As the death sweat rolled off and fell down on her pillow
Oh, her mem’ry still lives although she is dead
You remember the kiss and the last words she uttered
Oh the arms that embraced you are with you no more
As you stand by her grave teardrops fall on her casket
And you vowed there to meet her on that happy shore

The sun was slowly sinking or the hilltops far away
The land was endless beauty where the dying soldier lay
Tears were streaming down his face as he slowly raised his head
And these were the dying words he said
   Oh carry me back to old Tennessee
   Let this be my last repose
   Lay my feet beneath while I lie
   Lay my head beneath the rose
Take this message to my mother for I know she’s old and gray
At home I know she’s waiting for her boy’s return some day
Oh my mother I’ve come through for my country and for you
And I’m dying for the red white and blue
O’er the hills of Tennessee where the wild wind wonders free
There’s a little girl waiting there for me
Tell her that the rose she gave me will be placed upon my grave
In memory of her soldier brave

Would you never call me darlin
Do you believe all those lies
Will you break my heart darlin
When you say your last goodbye
    Each night I dream of you darlin
    Those sparkling eyes of heavenly blue
    Please tell me that you still love me
    I could never love no one but you
Many nights we strolled together
Down lover’s land you and me
There you whispered that you loved me
No other’s darlin you would be
I will give you back your letters
And your picture stained with tears
It would be so hard my darlin’
To go on without you through the years

It was springtime when I found you like a flower
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I soon could see your love was changing
Broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
   Like the weather your heart changes with each season
   Springtime, summer, fall, and winter too
   Though I know I’ll never understand the reason
   I still wonder why each season changes you
Come spring, you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall again, I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery

I never was so lonesome for my home town
Seems I never was so far away
Now I can here the freight train a blowing
I’ll be gone before the break of day
I’ll have to quit my daily rambling
Tonight I’m gonna start my journey back
Sitting on the top an old box car
Sailing down that silvery stream of track
East bound freight train east bound freight train
Take me home again
East bound freight train east bound freight train
Let me stay ’til the end
Now I’ll never stray from my home town
Never leave again to roam
I know that I was born to wander
But I’m gonna stick around my home
Now I see the smoke a rolling
Out on that old smoke stack
I’m sitting on the top of an old box car
Sailing down that silvery stream of track

I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I courted a fair young maiden
But her age I did not know
Oh her hair was dark and curly
And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head
Molly dear, go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I’ll run away with thee
No I’ll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best
The ocean’s deep and I can’t wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I’ll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o’er the tide
I’ll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain’t my home
I’ll go back to East Virginia
Leave old North Carolina alone
I don’t want your green back dollar
I don’t want your watch and chain
All I want is you my darling
Say you’ll take me back again
For you know I’d like to see you
At my door you’re welcome in
At my gate I’ll always greet you
For you’re the girl I tried to win

Eating out of your hand you think you’ve got me on string
You’ve fooled me more then once but let me tell you just one thing
Someday I’ll leave you woman then you’ll understand
A man can only take so much of eating out of your hand.
I’m tired of eating out of your hand I’m tired of getting told
These blues are leaving me as of now I’l1 be the one so bold
You better walk the chalk line and let this poor man be
Or else you’ll find yourself alone footloose and fancy free.
When I come home you’re waiting to question what I’ve done
You have my free time planned for me I work from sun to sun
If only you would realize that old stuff gets old
A man likes just a little time that he can call his own.
You’re oh so domineering your wish is my command
Your jealous heart won’t let me live you boss me and demand
New clothes a diamond ring so fine a Cadillac is grand
On payday I’m your victim and I’m eating out of your hand.

I’ve traveled o’er this country wide seeking fortune fair
Up and down the two coast lines I’ve traveled everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West back along the line
I’m going now to the place that’s best that old hometown of mine
   Eight more miles and Louisville will come into my view
   Eight more miles on this old road and I’ll never more be blue
   I knew some day that I’d come back I knew it from the start
   Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart
There’s bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she’s long and she is tall
But she’s the kind that you can’t find a traveling through the land
I’m on my way this very day to win her heart and hand
Now I can picture in my mind a place we’ll call our home
A humble little hut for two we’ll never want to roam
The place that’s right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville

It’s eight-thirty now I’m still waiting for you
I wonder where you can be
You promised to come home but now I’m all alone
And I’ve got those eight thirty blues
You better stop your rambling and stay in your place
Or else I won’t be waiting for you
But if you won’t listen just do as you please
I won’t have those eight thirty blues
It’s eight thirty now but you don’t seem to care
How long I’ve waited for you
Sweetheart when you get home you’ll find you’re all alone
Then you’ll have those eight thirty blues

I can’t believe you told me you don’t love me anymore
‘Cause I stayed out on the road too much to care
But ain’t I gotta make a living and it’s the only thing I know
To feed the kids and buy the clothes you wear
But if you think you’d be better off with someone else beside you
Pack your things and get on out the door
When I service up my rig and I’ll find out where I’m going
I don’t think I want to see you anymore
When I put eighteen wheels on the highway
And the freight yard fades out of sight
I put you farther from my mind with each grindin’ of the gears
I’ll be holdin’ someone else tomorrow night
There’s a pretty girl waitin’ down in Monroe
Who’ll meet me at the docks when I get in
When I’ll put eighteen wheels on the highway this time
I ain’t never coming back to you again.
All I ever wanted when I come in off the road
Was a few kind words to make me feel at home
And a hug from all the children wife beside the door
To let me know they missed me while I’s gone.
But you never once was with me
and I’ve known for oh so long
It’s a different road we’re travelin’
you and I
Don’t you try to fool me with your tears
cryin’ don’t become you
There ain’t nothin’ you can do but say good-bye

Emotions are making me care more for you
I’ve found a heart I know will always be so true
But still dearest darling I feel kinda blue
Keep wondering if someday somehow I might lose you.
Emotions are making me long for your kiss
For safe in your arms I know heavenly bliss
Emotions in my heart are calling for you
If you confess I bet you have emotions too.
Emotions can bring you much sorrow and pain
Emotions can be the sunshine after rain
Emotions are charged with the power of fate
These same emotions make you love or make you hate.

Down at the end of memory lane
There’s many who have walked it in gladness
I was the one who walked it last
I walked it alone in sadness
I received a letter from my love
I opened it and this is what it said
I’m sorry if hurt you but now it is too late
For another man my darliung I have wed
I remember her sweet little face
And her little freckled nose
With her golden hair hanging down her back
Tied with a big blue ribbon bow
We were pals and chums together there
I loved her with all my heart and soul
But she married another without a thought or care
And she left me in this world alone and cold

True love it has been untill now dear
They tell me that true love is blind
But right now I see It’s as plain as can be
You’ve come to the end of the line
You thought you would leave me broken hearted
You thought you would leave me way behind
Well I’ve paid my fare you’ve had more than your share
You’ve come to the end of the line
You’ve rode for half fare until now dear
But you boarded the wrong bus this time
So I have a transfer for you
well you made me blue
You’ve come to the end of the line
You thought you would leave me broken hearted
You thought you that would break this heart of mine
Well I’ve had enough you can pack up your stuff
You’ve come to the end of the line
Well I’ve had enough
you can pack up your stuff
You’ve come to the end of the line

Soon I’ll lay my burden down and I’ll wear a starry crown
I’ll be happy at the end of the road
Where there’s never grief or pain everyone will be the same
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
 
Life is often hard to bear many worries woes and cares
And we often wonder how we bear the load
But there is a better way Jesus went and paved the way
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
 
Now don’t walk this road of sin, let the savior enter in
Let him lead you to his blessed abode
Where there is no other way and he’ll call you any day
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
 
Soon I’ll lay my burden down and I’ll wear a starry crown
I’ll be happy at the end of the road
Where there’s never grief or pain everyone will be the same
What a meetin’ at the end of the road

Endless highway as far as I can see
The road will take me back to her tonight
It’s been so long since I’ve seen her smile
I’ll be counting all the miles ’til I get home.
   How many hours ’til I hold her?
   How many days before we hit the road again?
   Endless highway
   she don’t know how much I miss her
Headed down this road and bound for Tennessee.
Lonesome feeling deep inside my heart
Longing for this weary night to end
I’ll think about her try to keep my tired eyes open
Come the morning light I’ll be back home again.

Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line
Running o’er the C&O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Cevile head porters on the line
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind 
Georgie’s mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you’ll get there just on time 
Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie’s breast did smash
His head was against the firebox door the flames are rolling high
I’m glad I was born for an engineer to die on the C&O road 
The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy be still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God’s blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three 
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee

Moonlight shinning over Dixie
To my heart will ever bring
Dreams of snowy fields of cotton
Everywhere the darkies sing
   In the evening in the moonlight
   In dear old Tennessee
   And the evening bells are ringing
   Across the hills so tenderly
Moonlight makes me sigh for you dear
Makes me long to hold your hand
I know I’m missing hugs and kisses
Far away from Dixieland
My darling come come I am waiting
Come let me hold you very near
We’ll build a bower among the flowers
Growing down in Dixieland

I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place the casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train
The baby’s eyes were red from weepin
His little heart is filled with pain
Oh dad he cried they’re takin mama
Away from us on the evening train
I turned to walk away from the depot
It seems I heard here call my name
Take care of baby and tell him daring
That I’m goin home on the evening train
I pray that god will give me courage
To carry on til we meet again
It’s hard to know she’s gone forever
They’re carryin her home on the evening train
I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place the casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train

Look at the sky baby what do you see?
Looks like the tears that I’ve cried
Falling down like rain on the ground
Every time you say good-bye.
Take a look around now why don’t you feel
The way the cold wind stings and blinds
And each time we part like arrows through your heart
Every time you say good-bye.
   There’s a restless feeling knocking at my door today
   There’s a shadow hanging ’round my garden gate
   I read between the lines of words you can’t disguise
   Love has gone away and put these tears in my eyes.
Look at the sky baby see how it cries
Ain’t it just like my tears
Falling down like rain on the ground
Every time you say good-bye.

Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
Lord I wanna go to heavenbut I don’t wanna die
I long for the day that I’ll have a new birth ‘stead of grievin’ here on earth
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.
Once upon a time there was a man his name was Heas-i-kie
He walked with God both day and night but he didn’t want to die
He cried Oh Lord, please let me live, oh, mend these broken bones
God smiled down on Heasikie and gave him fifteen years to go.
When Jesus walked upon this earth he knew his father’s friends
He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of man
When Judas had betrayed him his father heard his cry
He was brave enough unto his death but he didn’t want to die.

I am a face lost in the crowd
A defeated man no one cares about
For the dreams I’ve had are gone somehow
I’m just a face lost in the crowd
All hopes of wealth and fame are gone
And darkness looms where the sun once shone
No light is there the fire’s burned out
And I’m just a face lost in the crowd
The tears I’ve shed now blur my eyes
The friends I’ve known would not recognize
This broken man with no way out
I’m just a face lost in the crowd

My brave boy sleeps in his faded coat of blue
In a lonely grave unknown lies a heart that beats so true
He sank faint and hungry among the famished brave
And they laid him sad and lonely within a nameless grave
   No more the bugle calls oh weary one
   Rest noble spirits in their graves unknown
   For we’ll find you and know you among the good and true
   Where a robe of white is given for a faded coat of blue
He cried “Give me water and just a little crumb
And my mother she will bless you through all the years to come
And tell my sweet sister so gentle good and true
That I’ll meet her up in Heaven in my faded coat of blue”
No dear one was nigh him to close his mild blue eyes
No gentle voice was by him to give him sweet replies
No stone marks the lonely sod on a lad so brave and true
In a lonely grave he’s sleeping in his faded coat of blue

The flowers I saw in the wildwood
Have since dropped their beautiful leaves
And the many dear friends of my childhood
Have slumbered many years in their graves
But the bloom of the flowers I remember
Though their smiles I may never more see
For the cold chilly winds of December
Stole my flowers’ companions from me
   It’s no wonder that I’m broken hearted
   And stricken with sorrow should be
   For we have met we have loved we have parted
   My flowers companions and me
How dark looks this world and how dreary
When we part from the ones that we love
There is rest for the faint and the weary
And friends to meet with loved ones above
For in heaven I can but remember
When from earth my soul shall be free
There no cold chilly winds of December
Shall steal my companions from me

As I look at the Ietters that you wrote to me
It’s you that I’m thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love.
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said good-bye
I remember our faded love.

Faded love and winter roses
Always bloom in memory
Faded love and winter roses
Yearning hearts that used to be
    Will they meet again tomorrow
    Where they parted yesterday
    Give me back the winter roses
    And the love you took away
Faded love and winter roses
Spring forth with a lonely tear
Faded love and winter roses
Still recall these yesteryears
    Will I always be a dreamer
    Dreamin of a used to be
    Faded love and winter roses
    Bloom and die in memory

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They’re like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they’re gone
They’ll tell to you some loving story
And they’ll make you think that they love you well
And away they’ll go and court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell
I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I’d write a letter to my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
And when he’d ask, I would deny
Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it’s new
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew

Falling leaves that lie scattered on the ground
The birds and flowers that were here now can’t be found
All his friends that he oince had are not around
They are scattered like the leaves upon the ground.
Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings until
It’s too late and they are ready to lie down
Beneath the leaves there scattered on the ground.
Lord let my eyes see every need of every man;
Let me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I’m laid beneath that mossy ground
There’ll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground.
To your grave there’s no use taking any gold;
It’s no use when it’s time for hands to fold.
When you leave this world for a better home some day
The only thing you’ll take is what you gave away.

I remember the face of an angel
The love that was faithful and true
I left that dear girl in the mountains
For a ramblin’ life empty and blue
Sweet roses bloom where they’re layin’
Wild flowers seed on the wind
That valley was closer to heaven
Than any place this poor fool has been
   It’s a far cry from here to Virginia
   But I’d crawl every inch of that ground
   My teardrops fall like rain on the roof
   For that Blue Ridge home where I’m bound
This highway’s a ribbon of lonesome
Don’t care where I lay my head down
For ten years it’s died broken hearted
My sweet mountain darlin’ is gone
I remember the face of an angel

Farewell Nellie farewell darling
Soon with strangers I must roam
Don’t forget the one that loves you
Far away from friends and home
     Fly across the ocean birdie
     Fly across the deep blue sea
     Take this message to my darling
     She’ll be glad to hear from me
You have told me that you love me
But you haven’t proved it true
So I’ll go and court some other
That will love me more than you
When the whippoorwills are singing
Across the dark and lonely sea
When you’re thinking of ten thousand
Will you sometimes think of me
How my heart is filled with sorrow
And my eyes are filled with tears
No I’ll not forget you darling
If I live ten thousand years

Farewell, Nellie, farewell, darling
Soon with strangers I must roam
Don’t forget the one that loves you
Far away from friends and home
   Fly across the ocean, birdie
   Fly across the deep, blue sea
   Take this message to my darling
   She’ll be glad to hear from me
You have told me that you love me
But you have unproved true
So I’ll go and court some other
That will love more than you
When the whippoorwills are singing
Across the dark and lonely sea
When you’re thinking of 10,000
Will you sometimes think of me
How my heart is filled with sorrow
And my eyes are filled with tears
So I’ll not forget you, darling
If I live 10,000 years

   Farther along we’ll know more about it
   Farther along we’ll understand why
   Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
   We’ll understand it all by and by
Tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
When death has found and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

Twas on one Saturday evening
About the hour of ten
In a little mining town
Where trouble did begin
Everybody there were drinking
There were whiskey everywhere
Dewey Lee got to thinking
He had no business there
He was so tall and handsome
His heart so true and brave
Joe Jenkins pulled his pistol
And sent him to his grave
He took the life of Dewey
When life had just began
And Dewey went to Heaven
While Joe went to the pen
He took the life of Dewey
Because he would not tell
We know he murdered Dewey
For Dewey’s pistol fell
His mother sits now weepin’
She weeps and mourns all day
She prays to meet her boy
In a better world some day
So hearken to my story
And what I have to say
Get right with your Maker
We’ll meet Him again some day
The clerk said, “Stand up, boy
And listen to your crime!”
They sent him down to Richmond
To serve out his time
Young men all take warning
For this you must outlive
Don’t take the life of anyone
For life you cannot give
You may possess great riches
Put many beneath the sod
But money won’t hire a lawyer
When you stand before your God

He was the blessed father of Abraham
Brought his people to the promised land
Poured milk and honey at their feet
Told them to ask they shall recieve
    Do you know the father son and the holy ghost
    The prince of peace and the heavenly host
    He delivered us from sin and he’ll come this way again
    Do you know the father son and the holy ghost
He cured the blind the sick and the deaf
He raised poor Lazarus up from the dead
Turned pure water into wine
And sent his only son to die
When you know these miracles to be true
Trust what the Lord has in store for you
Believe me my friend you best get right
Cause this could be the night we all take flight

I left my old home to ramble this country
My mother and dad said son don’t go wrong
Remember that God will always watch o’er you
And we will be waiting for you here at home
   Son don’t go astray was what they both told me
   Remember that love for God can be found
   But now they’re both gone this letter just told me
   For years they’ve been dead, the fields have turned brown
For many long years this world I have rambled
No thoughts of the day when I would return
Now as I go home and find no one waiting
The price I have paid to live and to learn

Twelve hundred miles its length and breadth
The four square city stands
It’s gem set walls of jasper shine
Not made by human hands
One hundred miles its gates are wide
Abundance entrance there
With fifty miles of elbow room
On either side to spare
   When the gates swing wide on the other side
   Just beyond the sunset sea
   There’ll be room to spare as we enter there
   Room for you and room for me
   For the gates are wide on the other side
   Where the flowers ever bloom
   On the right hand on the left hand
   Fifty miles of elbow room
Sometimes I’m cramped and crowded here
And long for elbow room
I want to reach for altitude
Where fair flowers bloom
It won’t be long til I shall pass
Into that city fair
With fifty miles of elbow room
On either side to spare
 

Now boys gather ’round take a tip from me
I’m sure that you will all agree
If you let a gal fool you with fate
You’ll soon be swinging on the golden gate
You’ll miss out on all the fun
If you make love to only one
You’d better take heed to my little song
Find ’em fool ’em and leave ’em alone
That little love bug is the cutest thing
At first its sweet but it makes its sting
You’ll find the wound is hard to treat
Be sure you play this little game neat
Now if you find a gal you like
Just date her once but no more than twice
If you don’t watch her little ways
She’ll spoil your happy ramblin’ day

Here she comes, look at her go
There she goes, eaten that coal
Watch her fly, look at her sail,
Let her by, by, by, the Fireball Mail
Let her go, look at her steam,
Here the low, whistle and scream
Like a hound dog wagging its tail,
Let her by, by, by, the Fireball Mail
Engineer, making up time,
Tracks are clear, look at her climb
See that freight, clear the rail,
I’ll bet she’s late, late, late, the Fireball Mail
Watch her swerve, look at her sway,
Get that curve out of the way
Watch her fly, look at her sail,
Let her by, by, by, the Fireball Mail

Springtime is near my darling
You say that you are going away
My heart will be with you my darling
And I’m counting now the days
   I know that soon I’ll have to travel
   I know I’m over the hill
   I feel so all alone my darling said she’d be gone
   When I heard that first whippoorwill
The flowers are blooming little darling
With the budding of the trees
I hear the night birds a crying
I know that they are warning me
Our love was planted little darling
Just like the farmer plants his grain
But there will never be a harvest
On the hills the whippoorwills now sing

You cheated on me I tried to be fair
But you don’t believe in doing your share
But I’ve learned my lesson and now I can say
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
    Your kisses don’t thrill me like they used to do
    Your arms only chill me I’m glad that we’re through
    My heart was once yearning but now I can say
    The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
You fooled me a while you thought you were wise
You even believed I fell for your lies
But the trick turned on you now I can say
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away

Those pretty wild flowers I love them so well
The flowers know secrets that I’ll never tell
I go out to pick a bouquet of all
And bring them all in before the leaves start to fall
When the leaves start to fall and the flowers have died
If only little darling I could be by your side
Tho’ it breaks my heart to hear your name
Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring
I wish I could see her and talk of our love
And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I’ll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way
The memories of you dear I’ll never erase
There’ll never be another that can take your place
I’ll still keep our secret with the flowers of love
And we’ll pick them together in Heaven above

Fly around my blue-eyed gal
Fly around my daisy
Fly around my blue-eyed gal
You almost drove me crazy.
Once I had a fortune
I laid it in a trunk
Lost it all all gambling
One night when I got drunk.
Wished I was in the West country
Sittin’ in a big armchair
One arm ’round my whiskey barrel
The other ’round my dear.
If I had a scolding wife
Tell you what I’d do
Trade her off for a Barlow knife
Paddle my own canoe.
It’s every day and Sunday too
It seems so dark and hazy
I’m thinking about my blue-eyed gal
She’s done run me crazy.
If I had no horse at all
I’d be found a’ crawlin’
Up and down this rocky road
A’ looking for my dariing.
Went up on the mountain
To give my horn a blow
Thought I heard somebody say
Yonder comes my beau

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my daisy
Fly around my pretty little miss
You almost drive me crazy
The higher up the cherry tree
The riper grows the cherries
The more you hug and kiss the girls
The sooner they will marry
Coffee grows on white oak trees
The river flows with brandy
If I had my pretty little miss
I’d feed her sugar candy
Going to get some weevily wheat
I’m going to get some barley
Going to get some weevily wheat
And bake a cake for Charlie

If I’d only listened to what my mama said
I would not be here today
A lying around this old jailhouse
Wasting my poor life away
   If I was on some foggy mountain top
   I’d sail away to the West
   I’d sail all around this whole wide would
   To the girl I love the best
Oh she caused me to weep and she caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
Oh the lonesome pines and the good old times
I’m on my way back home
Now if you see that girl of mine
There’s something you can tell her
She need not fool her time away
To court some other feller

Your love is colder than a foggy river
Rollin on a heart of stone
You left me stranded on this foggy river
Cold and helpless and alone
   I knew someday that you would turn me down
   I got worries on my mind
   Yes I’m doomed to sail this foggy river
   Till I leave my love behind
There’s no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrows fills this foggy river
Everything I had is gone
I can’t escape this broken heart of mine
I’ve no freedom anymore
Heaven help me on this foggy river
Till I reach that distant shore

Once I loved your fond affection
All my hopes on you was spent
Till a dark eyed girl persuaded
And you care no more for me 
Go on and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart to love another
Never on earth will I call you mine 
When I’m dead and in my coffin
And my pale face towards the sun
Will you come and sit beside me
And think of what you’ve done 
When I’m dead and in my coffin
And the shroud about me bows
Will you come and scatter roses
Upon your lover’s mound

Once I had a true love sweeter than the stars above
And I loved her with all my heart
It brought tears in her eyes when I told her goodbye
All because of my fool foolish pride
Oh foolish pride I can’t live with you
For you have driven away my darling
You have broken her heart now you’re keeping us apart
Foolish pride I’ll never forgive you
We would sit all alone she would talk of our home
And of days when she’d be my own wife
So softly she would say when is our wedding day
I’m so happy my darling I could cry

Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it’s pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground
   I traced her little footprints in the snow
   I found her little footprints in the snow
   I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
   For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she’s up in heaven she’s with the angel band
I know I’m going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

There’s a tale that they tell down in ol’ Wolf County
About a murderous husband and his family of three
One day his neighbors from over the hill
it was so deathly still
The killer he left a note and I know how it read
I hope you don’t find me I’d rather be dead
Then live in your jailhouse for the rest of my days
‘Til the jury it hangs me for my wicked ways
Sometimes at night I wake to the sound
Of the men in the distance and baying of hounds
Once on a full moon in the spring of the year
I heard breaking branches and footsteps so near
Well the posse searched it was five days or more
He head in the caves gave himself up
‘Fore he got to the courthouse a man a shot him down
He said I’m not sorry for what I have done
But I cannot live like a man on the ran
I’m glad that you killed me you can dig me my grave
It can’t be much worse thanthat dark lonely cave

When first unto this land I came
She was a virgin paradise
The truth was there for all to see
No falsehood and no lies.
She was overflowing
With everything we need
We took so much we never saw
The forest for the trees.
This land she is my lover
She fills me with desire
Seasons come and seasons go
Earth water wind and fire.
I cleared this land with my bare hands
She gave me everything so free
She gave so much I couldn’t see
The forest for the trees.
I’m an addict with a habit
I’m kept so well supplied
With all my greed and hope and love and fear
1 can’t be satisifed.
I took my young son up on a clear cut mountain
I fell down on my knees
I prayed that he would someday see the forest for the trees
I pray that we might someday see the forest for the trees.

Forgive me for all the pain I’ve caused you
Forgive me for unkind words I’ve said
I thought once that I could live without you
Please forgive me and I’ll make it up somehow
I left you and left you broken hearted
I left you but now I can’t forget
I thought once that I could live without you
But I’m paying with a broken heart instead
I wish I had never made you blue sweet heart
I wish I could live it over now
I thought once that I could live without you
Please forgive me and I’ll make it up somehow

They stood in the moonlight beside the gate
Goodbye my darling I know you’ll wait
He sees her weeping and smile through her tears
Saying I’ve been true love through these long years
For on tomorrow at the break of day
He was to journey far far away
He held her closer his promised bride
And to her questions these words replied
   I’ve loved you always yes I’ve been true
   My heart shall ever beloved for you
   O darling believe me far over the sea
   Through life or death so faithful I’ll be
One year past by he’s coming home
His pilgrimage over no longer to roam
And smiling he thinks of her shinning eyes
Shinning with welcoming glad surprise
A dandy letter he takes from his breast
To which his extended lips were pressed
And reading once more by the warming light
These words he had spoken to her that night
Once more he seeks the old garden gate
But he rides a land alas it’s too late
The wedding is over the knot is tied
He finds his darling another’s bride
And later they found him there on the grass
A pistol near by tells what had passed
A crop of letters that explained the deed
And in the pale moonlight these words did read

Don’t you remember on that rocky mountain side
Where we laid down to rest
You promised to be my blue eyed boy
While the sun sank in the west 
Now hand me down my old gray hat
It’s hanging there on a nail
Before this time tomorrow morn
I’ll be gone on that long long trail
Ifin you see me standing on the porch
With a forty four in my hand
Just tell them all I’ve killed myself
Cause you’ve gone to some far distant land
I wish to the lord I’d never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen them to brown eyes
Or heard that flattering tongue
I never will listen what another man says
Let his hair be black or brown
Unlessin he’s on some scaffold high
Crying darlin I wish to come down
Don’t you remember on that rocky mountain side
Where we laid down to rest
You promised to be my blue eyed boy
While the sun sank in the west

Forty years I’ve been gone
I served my time it’s been so long
I took a life I know it was wrong
I served my time lord knows I’m going home
   Shackled to a ball and chain
   I worked in the snow I worked in the rain
   I laid the tracks never rode the train
   Forty years of suffering forty years of pain
I had a wife and a little queen
I’ve had a son I’ve never seen
All I have left now it seems
Is a broken heart and broken dreams
Now I’m old, I’ve done my time
Ain’t nothin left but to sit and pine
Nobody here even knows my name
I have no one but myself to blame

Oh why did you leave me in this lonesome place
With four walls around me and a memory of your face
Why can’t I be happy why can’t I forget
With four walls around me I wish we’d never met
   With four walls around me it gets so lonesome dear
   Dreaming of you darling and wishing you were here
   Four walls around me my heart is full of pain
   Trying to forget you but it’s all in vain.
Oh someday you’ll be sorry you left me al1alone
With four walls around you you’ll remember how you done me wrong
Your time is coming and I know it won’t be long
You’ll have nothing there but four walls and a memory of this song

Yonder comes that Four-Twenty Special
Fastest train on the line
And when you hear that whistle a’ blowin’
You will know she’s right on time.
One night while a poolin’ down through Dixie
The fireman said “look ahead”
And the sight they saw made the blood run cold
North bound freighter straight ahead
I’ve worked on this railroad most of my life
And I guess I’ll work ’til I die
But I’ve never seen a train like the Four-Twenty Special
Her lonesome whistle made me want to cry

   She walks through the corn leading down to the river
   Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
   She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
   And left me to die like a fox on the run
   Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, on the run
Everybody knows, the reason for the fall
When woman tempted man down in paradise’s hall
This woman tempted me, and took me for a ride
Like the lonely fox, I need a place to hide
We’ll pour a glass of wine, to fortify our soul
We’ll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I see a string of girls, who’ll put me on the floor
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at my door

In the evening by the moonlight
Down beside the silver sea
We strolled hand in hand together
You and I my Francis Lee
    Please forgive me little darlin
    If you set my conscience free
    My lonely heart is broken
    Over you my Francis Lee
Francis Lee I dearly love you
Though I said that we must part
Many times I have regretted
That I broke your lovin’ heart
I’m alone now sad and lonely
Oh how grave my sorrow be
Your sweet memory still haunts me
And my conscience bothers me

Frankie and Johnnie were lovers
Lordy how they did love
They swore to be true to each other
Just as true as the stars above
He was her man but he’s doing her wrong
Frankie she was a good woman
Just as every one knows
She gave her man a hundred dollars
Just to buy him a new suit of clothes
He was her man but he done her wrong
Johnnie went down to the corner
He asked for a glass of beer
Frankie went down in an hour or so
Said has my loving Johnnie been here
He’s my man but he’s doing me wrong
I ain’t gonna tell you no stories
I ain’t gonna tell you no lies
I saw your lovin’ Johnnie
Making love to Nellie Bligh
He’s your man but he’s doing you wrong
Frankie went home in a hurry
She didn’t go for fun
She hurried home to get a hold of
A big forty four gun
He’s her man but he’s doing her wrong
Roll me over darling
Roll me over slow
Roll me on my right side
Cause my left one hurts me so
He’s my man but he done me wrong

I was born in the Southland
Twenty some odd years ago
I ran away for the first time
When I was four years old.
   I’m a free-born man
   My home is on my back
   I know every inch of highway
   Every foot of back road every mile of railroad track
I got a gal in Cincinnati
Got a women in San Antone
I always love the girl next door
But anyplace is home.
I got me a worn out guitar
I carry an old tote sack
I hocked it about two hundred times
But I always get 1 back
Well you may not like my appearance
You may not like my song
You may not like the way I talk
But you like the way I’m gone

I’m as free a little bird as I can be
I’m as free a little bird as I can be
I’m free at my age as a bridie in the cage
I’m as free a little bird as I can be
Carry me home little birdie carry me home
Carry me home little birdie carry me home
Carry me home to my wife she’s the joy of my life
Carry me home little birdie carry me home
I’ll never build my nest on the ground
Neither in the forks of a tree
I’ll build my nest in the ruffle of her dress
Where the bad boys can never bother me

Well, I was born in the Southland
Twenty-some odd years ago
I ran away for the first time
When I was four years old
   I’m a free born man
   My home is on my back
   I know every inch of highway
   And every foot of back road
   Every mile of railroad track
I got a gal in Cincinnati
Got a woman in San Antone
I always loved the girl next door
But anyplace is home
I got me a worn-out guitar
I carry an old tote sack
I hocked it about two hundred times
But I always get it back
You may not like my appearance
May not like my song
May not tike the way I talk
But you like the way I’m gone

   Freight train, freight train, going so fast
   Freight train, freight train, going so fast
   Please don’t tell what train I’m on
   So they won’t know where I’ve gone
When I am dead and in my grave
No more good times here I’ll crave
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all that I’m gone to sleep
When I die, lord, bury me deep
Way down on old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old Number Nine
As she comes rolling by

I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
The humming of the driver was my lullaby
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry
I got the freight train blues Lawdy Lawdy
Got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I gotta Oh Lawdy
Guess I’m never gonna lose the freight train blues
My daddy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of the engineer
My sweetie is a brakeman and that ain’t no joke
It’s a shame the way she keeps a good man broke
Aeroplanes and autos always leave me cold
The moaning of a steamboat never stirs my soul
The only thing that makes me want to navigate
Is a wildcat whistle on a south bound freight
I know I’m old enough to quit this running round
I’ve tried a hundred times to stop and settle down
But every time I find a place I’d like to stay
I hear a freight train holler and I’m on my way

Casey Jones he was a mighty man
But now he’s resting in the promised land
The kind of music he could understand
Was an eight wheel driver under his command
   He made the freight train boogie
   All the time
   He made the freight train boogie
   As he rolled down the line
When the fireman started ringing the bell
Everybody on the line could tell
Casey Jones was a coming to town,
On an 8-wheel driver that was burning ’em down

Froggy went a’ courtin’ and he did ride uh huh
Froggy went a’ courtin’ and he did ride uh huh
Froggy went a’ courtin’ and he did ride
Sword and a pistol by his side Uh huh uh huh oh yeah.
Well he rode up to Miss Mouse’s door
He knocked so hard that he made it roar
Well he said to Miss Mousie Will you marry me?
Oh Miss Mousie how I love thee”
Where will the wedding supper be
We’ll get married in a Sycamore tree

Cotton to satin
Birmingham to Manhatten
From a pick-up to a long limousine
Cotton to satin Birmingham to Manhatten
She had to follow her dream.
I saved up enough to buy her one small diamond
That’s the year our old tractor broke down
And the dream house I promised her still lies by the shade tree
Some old bricks and boards on the ground.
She begged me to take her to see New York City
So I mortgaged the farm and we were gone
While we were there she took up with a rich man
I came back to the country alone.
There is the garden where she touched every flower
There’s the meadow where we walked hand in hand
If only she’d waited she’d have more than she dreamed of
Because today they struck oil on my land.
David Parmaley; I Know A Good Thing

Its a long time I’ve waited my darling
Just hoping some day you’d settle down
But now its too late it’s sll over
From now on I won’t be hanging around
From now on I won’t be hanging around
From now on I won’t be hanging around
I’ve taken all I can find another man
From now on I won’t be hanging around
I’ve tried and I’ve tried to make you love me
But bright lights and bright life I’ve found
Its the only love you’ve ever known my darling
From now on I won’t be hanging around

The story’s in the Bible it’s a message sad but true
The life our Saviour lived on earth is told
Found upon the pages of the Master’s book of truth
Every word so precious to my soul
From the manger to the cross rugged cross of Calvary
The road that Jesus walked for you and me all alone
By the world forsaken still He shed His blood for me
From the manger to the cross the rugged cross of Calvary
Amidst the stranger’ss cattle where the birth of Jesus came
The lonely manger kept Him from the cold
And there was the beginning of the journey Jesus made
Today it is the greatest story told
Many wonders were revealed while here on earth He dwelled
He healed the sick and made the blind to see
Five thousand were the numbers of the hungry who did feast
He blessed and multiplied the bread and meat
No earthly treasures did He own He sought no wealth or fame
Weary was the path He had to trod
Here He suffered many things for this world knew Him not
He died upon the cross the Son of God

It was only yesterday that I heard you say
You wanted me more than silver or gold
Now another’s love you have and our love has grown cold
It’s a long way from your heart to mine
It’s a long long way from your heart to mine
I didn’t really mean to be unkind
But I cheated and I lied and I ever made you cry
It’s a long way from your heart to mine
It was such a short time from the day we met
I held you closely in my arms
Then you went away and I went astray
It’s a long way from your heart to mine

I hurried through the darkness
The last time my darling to see
I heard those bloodhounds crying
The sheriff was coming after me
She had the sun in her hair
Lips like cherry wine
She loved nobody else
Now I sit and pine
They said I killed a stranger
They tried to hang me high
I ran as fast as I could go
I wished that I could fly

I hear the sad howling of coyotes prowling
It sounds so mournful to me
It brings back memories of cherished loved ones
Of ones I’m longing to see
   I’m riding away out on the lone prairie
   The rangers are searching for me
   I’m riding away from my home in Texas
   A fugitive ever to be
I had a good mother I had a good father
They handed a warning to me
The men that I ran with committed a murder
And laid the blame on me
Little Maggie my sweetheart I know she’s lonely
And longs for me to return
My happiness ended the night we parted
And now for her I yearn
How lonely how dreary with nothing to cheer me
My thoughts go stealing back home
My life of sadness will never know gladness
I’m branded forever to roam

I cant forget how queer I felt
When first I fell in love
I had a most sincere tactor
Squeezing a lady’s glove
Her lovely hand was in it
As I waltzed around so gay
I thought myself in paradise
It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   I thought myself in paradise
   It’s funny when you feel that way
Again we met one afternoon
As we were all alone
I pumped up nerve to ask if she
Would one day be my own
She blushed and said go ask poppa
And ask him if I may
I danced a cantor around the room
It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   I danced a cantor around the room
   It’s funny when you feel that way
The old boy said that we might we
And so he crowned my bliss
I shall be a double man
In about a month from this
Though it seemed to me somehow the time
Will never pass away
For I long to hear the wedding bells
It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   It’s funny when you feel that way
   I long to hear the wedding bells
   It’s funny when you feel that way

It was the year of 1900 that was 80 years ago
Death come’d a howling on the ocean and when death calls you’ve got to go
Galveston had a sea wall just to keep the water down
But a high tide from the ocean blew the water all over the town.
Wasn’t that a mighty storm
Wasn’t that a mighty storm in the morning
Wasn’t that a mighty storm
It blew all the people away.
The sea began to rolling the ships they could not land
I heard a captain crying Oh God save a drowning man
The rain it was a falling and the thunder began to roll
The lightning flashed like Hell-fire and the wind began to blow
The trees fell on the island and the houses gave away
Some they strived and drownded others died every way.
The trains at the station were loaded with the people all leaving town
But the trestle gave way with the water and the trains they went on down
Old death the cruel master when the winds began to blow
Rode in on a team of horses and cried death won’t you let me go.
The flood it took my mother it took my brother too
I thought I heard my father cry as I watched my mother go
Old death your hands are clammy when you’ve got them on my knee
You come and took my mother won’t you come back after me?

Death is an angel sent down from above
Sent for the buds and the flowers we love
Truly ’tis so, for in heaven’s own way
Each soul is a flower in the Master’s bouquet
   Gathering flowers for the Master’s bouquet
   Beautiful flowers that will never decay
   Gathered by angels and carried away
   Forever to bloom in the Master’s bouquet
Let us be faithful till life’s work is done
Blooming with love ’til the reaper has come
Then we’ll be gathered together someday
Transplanted to bloom in the Master’s bouquet

   I’ve been gathering flowers from the hillside
   To wreath around your brow
   But you’ve kept me a-waitin’ so long, dear
   The flowers have all withered now
I know that you have seen trouble
But never hang down your head
Your love for me is like the flowers
Your love for me is dead
It was on one bright June morning
The roses were in bloom
I shot and killed my darling
And what will be my doom?
Closed eyes cannot see these roses
Closed hands cannot hold them, you know
And these lips that still cannot kiss me
Has gone from me forever more

Get on up some glad morning
Get on up a new days dawning
Live forever with Jesus by and by
Get on up Heaven’s waiting
Friends and loved ones celebratin’
When I get up to my mansion in the sky
This old body’s getting weary
This whole world’s so dark and dreary
I can’t wait to see my new home up on high
Where I’ll rest from all my labor
Paul and Silas gonna be my neighbor
When I get up to my mansion in the sky
And if death should overtake me
I know my Lord’s gonna wake me
Gonna get up with a brand new body glorified
With troubles and trials far behind me
Gloryland that’s where you’ll find me
When I get up to my mansion in the sky

I told myself so many times that you still love me
In a vain attempt to keep my courage strong
But somehow I can’t make myself believe it
‘Cause the way you’re acting lately proves I’m wrong
The cards are on the table the writing’s on the wall
I can see you’re gonna leave me and the tears are gonna fall
It’s time I started doing anything I have to do
To help myself start getting over you
There’s not a thing that I can do to change the future
And I sure can’t change your mind ’cause I’ve tried
So I might as well admit I’m gonna lose you
‘Cause that leavin’ kind of looks there in your eye
Larry Sparks; Blue Mountain Memories

About three miles from the back town yard
The river curves on down
Not far south of the town depot
Sullivan’s shack was found
Up on the higher ground.
You could see him every day
Just walking down the line
With his old brown sack across his back
Long hair down behind
Speaking his worried mind.
   It’s a long way from the delta to the North Georgia hills
   A tote sack full of ginseng won’t pay my travelling bills
   I’m too old to ride the rails I’ll bum the road alone
   So I guess I’ll never make it back to home
   My muddy water Mississippi Delta home.
The winters here they get too cold
The damp it makes me ill
Can’t dig no roots on the mountain side
With the ground froze hard and still
Gotta stay at the foot of the hill.
But next summer
things turn right
The companies will pay high
I’ll make enough money to pay my bills
Bid these mountains goodbye
Then he said with a sigh.

If you’re traveling in the north country fair
Where the wind blows cold on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.
Well if you’re going in a snowflake storm
Where the rivers freeze and summers end
Will you see that she has a coat so warm
To protect her from the howling wind.
Please see for me if her hair hangs low
And flows in ringlets ’round her breasts
Please see for me if her hair hangs low
For that’s the way I remember her best.
Well I wonder if she’ll remember me you know
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the stillness of my night
In the brightness of my day.

One night while out for a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Geary and Pine
On her face there was beauty of nature
And her eyes just seemed to expand
Her hair was so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band
We strolled down the street together
In my pocket she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band
I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue velvet band
She left me to face all the trouble
With a diamond that was worth ten grand
They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I’m an innocent man
The guilty one now she lie’s dying
The girl in the blue velvet band
Last night when bed-time was ringin
Standing there close to the bars
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out in the ocean of stars
I’ll be out in a year and I’m leaving
But I’ll carry the name of a man
That served ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band
And when I get out I’ll endeavor
To live in some other land
And I’ll bid farewell to old Frisco
And the girl in the blue velvet band

‘Twas in the year of ’92,
In the merry month of June,
I left my mother and a home so dear
For the girl I loved on the greenbriar shore
My mother dear, she came to me
And said “Oh son, don’t go, “
“Don’t leave your mother and a home so dear
To trust a girl on the greenbriar shore “
But I was young and reckless too,
And I craved a reckless life
I left my mother with a broken heart
And I choosed that girl to be m’ wife
Her hair was dark and curly too
And her loving eyes were blue;
Her cheeks were like the red red rose
The girl I loved on the greenbriar shore
The years rolled on and the months rolled by
She left me all alone
Now I remember what mother said
Never trust a girl on the greenbriar shore

My sweetheart is a shy little miss
And one I fondly adore
And when you ask her for a kiss
She’ll give you just one and no more
She’ll give you just one and no more
She’ll give you just one and no more
And when you ask her for a kiss
She’ll give you just one and no more
Her dad was feelin old man
He always had a feelin for me
I can tell you when this feelin began
When his daughter I first went to see
I was bidding my sweetheart good night
In the usual manner you know
When a voice from the house said stick him towse ?
And give him one more as he goes
And give him one more as he goes
And give him one more as he goes
When a voice from the house said stick him towse ?
And give him one more as he goes
It was over the garden wall in a manner I’ll tell you not slow
He exclaimed with a swear and his foot smote the air
And I’ll give him one more as he goes
And I’ll give him one more as he goes
And I’ll give him one more as he goes
He exclaimed with a swear and his foot smote the air
And I’ll give him one more as he goes

In this world today while we’re living
Some folks say the worst of us they can
But when we are dead and in our caskets
They always slip some lilies in our hand
    Won’t you give me my flowers while I’m living
    And let me enjoy them while I can
    Pleae don’t wait till I’m ready to be buried
    And then slip some lilies in my hand
In this world is where we need our flowers
A kind word to help us get along
If you can’t give me flowers while I’m living
Then please don’t throw them when I’m gone

Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away
Roses adorn the narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay
   Give me the roses while I live
   Trying to cheer me on
   Useless are flowers that you give
   After the soul is gone
Kind words are useless when folks lie
Cold in a narrow bed
Don’t wait till death to speak kind words
Now should the words be said
Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay

Just at the close of a bright summer day
Just as the twilight had faded away
Soft on the breeze like the coo of a dove
Someone was singing an old song of love
   Tell me you love me and say you’ll be true
   I love nobody in this world but you
   Your heart and my heart in love will entwine
   Give me your love and I’ll give you mine
Come along with me to the quiet shady nook
Where flowers bloom at the side of the brook
Nature is sleeping, the birds are at rest
I’ll place a wild rose on your beautiful breast
I’ve something to ask you while you’re by my side
A question of love, of groom and of bride
And if you refuse me my heart it will pine
Give me your love and I’ll give you mine

   Oh glory oh glory oh glory to the lamb
   Hallelujah I am saved and I’m so glad I am
   Oh glory oh glory oh glory to the lamb
   Hallelujah I am saved and I’m so glad I am
On Monday I am happy on Tuesday full of joy
Wednesday I’ve got the faith the devil cant destroy
On Thursday and Friday walking in the light
Saturday I’ve got the victory and Sunday’s always bright
I fell in love with Jesus and he fell in love with me
That’s the very reason I’ve got the victory
I’m happy when it’s raining I’m happy when it shines
I’m happy now with Jesus I’m happy all the time

While drinking alone in a tavern one day
My eyes they hardly could see
I heard a kind voice ringing so loud and clear
And here is what the voice said to me
Go home ( go home ) go home ( go home )
And kneel by your bedside and pray
Go home ( go home ) go home ( go home )
God will answer your prayer today
I staggered across the room to the door
I almost fell on the floor
I’m sure there was laughter but I could not hear
For the words that still ring in my ears
God sobered my mind and He saved my soul
And he erased my thoughts from all fear
Then back to the tavern I preached of these words
The words that still ring in my ear
The crowd started leaving with heads bowed so low
As the bartender picked up the key
As he locked the door he murmured these words
Was the same words that God spoke to me

I’ve tried so hard to make you happy
There’s just one thing left to do
But if I can’t ever make you happy
Go out and find somebody new
I love you like the trees love sunshine
God knows how much I love you
But if I can’t ever make you all mine
Go out and find somebody new
I’ve tried so hard to make you love me
Just like other sweethearts do
But if I can’t ever make you love me
Go out and find somebody new
I know I’ll miss you so much darling
I know my heart will break in two
I know I want you to be happy
Go out and find somebody new

Go tell Aunt Rodie
go tell Aunt Rodie
Go tell Aunt Rodie
the old gray goose is dead
It’s the one she’s been saving
the one she’s been saving
The one she’s been saving to make a feather bed
She died last Friday
she died last Friday
She died last Friday with an achin’ in her head
Old grander’s weeping
old grander’s weeping
Old grander’s weeping because his wife is dead
The goslin’s are mourning
the goslin’s are mourning
The goslin’s are mourning because their mother’s dead

I’ve gotta home in that rock don’t you see
I’ve gotta home in that rock don’t you see
I’ve gotta home in that rock just beyond the mountain top
Hide thee old rock of ages clef for me
God gave Noah the rainbow sign don’t you see
God gave Noah the rainbow sign don’t you see
God gave Noah the rainbow sign no more water but for next time
Hide thee old rock of ages clef for me
Poor old Lazarus poor as I don’t you see
Poor old Lazarus poor as I don’t you see
Poor old Lazarus poor as I when he died he had a room on high
Hide thee old rock of ages clef for me
East and west the fire will roll hide thy me
East and west the fire will roll hide thy me
East and west the fire will roll how will it be for my poor soul
Hide thee old rock of ages clef for me
When this world’s all on fire hide thy me
When this world’s all on fire hide thy me
When this world’s all on fire let thy bosom be my pillow
Hide thee old rock of ages clef for me

I was a stranger brother right in sin
Didn’t even have the love of God within
But now I’ve found Him and I’m glad to say
I love my saviour more everyday
God loves His children brother yes I know
He will protect you anywhere you go
Just call the point He will get you there
God will protect you brother anywhere
Brother take warning while yet you have time
Don’t let old Satan lead you on down the line
Just tell old Satan to stay out of your way
God loves His children brother everyday
I’m glad I’ve found and I’m on my way
I’m going to follow Jesus everyday
Nothing can change me and I’m glad to say
God loves His children brother everyday

There’s a highway up in heaven and the streets are all pure gold
There’ll be shouting there forever in the home land of the soul
I shall meet with all my loved ones and the saints gone on before
On that highway up in heaven on that peaceful golden shore
Oh I’ll walk down heavens highway some sweet day
And I know I’ll hear my blessed savior say
Welcome to your home in heaven that I have prepared for you
For your cares and worries now on earth are through
I’ll be singing with the angels in those mansions there on high
Be at home with my dear Savior never more to say goodbye
Then again I’ll see my Mom and Daddy who went on before
Walk through glory shouting singing on God’s highway ever more

Goin where I’m goin where I ain’t never been before
Goin where I ain’t never been before
Goin where I ain’t never been before
Little gal good gal you ain’t no part of me
Little gal you ain’t no part of me
Little gal you ain’t no part of me
Goin where goin where the climate suits my clothes
Goin where the climate suits my clothes
Goin where I ain’t never been before

Goin up I’m goin’ way up
Just to see my Savior there
Goin up I’m goin’ way up
Let Him free my soul from sin
There’s a man who is standing at the pearly gates
And I know He’ll let me in
For I’m goin’ there to see my Savior
Let  Him free my soul from sin
Oh I want to be ready when He calls for me
I want to wear a long white robe
I want to wear those golden slippers on my feet
When He calls me I must go

I’m going to Chatanooga baby mine
Going to Chatanooga baby nine
Going to Chatanooga from there on to Cuba
Going to Chatanooga baby mine
Going round this world baby mine
Going round this world baby mine
Going round this world with a banjo pickin’ girl
Going round this world baby mine
Gonna write me a letter baby mine
Write me a letter baby mine
Write me a letter gonna tell that you’re better
Gonna write me a letter baby mine

    Going across the mountain
    Oh fair ye well
    Going across the mountain
    Hear my banjo tell
Going across the mountain
Join the boys in blue
When this war is over
I’ll come back to you
Got my rations on my back
My powder it is dry
Going across the mountain
Crissie don’t you cry
Waitin’ ‘fore it’s good daylight
If nothin happens to me
I’ll be way down yonder
In old Tennessee
‘Spect you’ll miss me when I’m gone
But I’m going through
When this fightin’s over
I’ll come back to you


Going back to the Blue Ridge mountains
Going back gonna leave today
Going back to the Blue Ridge mountains
Honey baby I’m going away
You can’t be my little darling
You can’t be my sweetheart now
You’ve been causing all my troubles
You don’t love me anyway
All our happy days together
Now are gone and you’re to blame
Just forget you ever knew me
Never even call my name
You have caused me lost of trouble
You have had your little way
Now I’m fed up with your flirting
Honey baby I’m going away

Going to my home in the mountains
The mountains is where I want to be
You know I’ve never been happy
Since I left those hills of Tennessee
Went away from home to save my mind
Forty years and I feel like eighty-nine
Going back home going to stay
Where me and my guitar will sing and play
Going up in holler
Head up a moonshine still
I’ll be so happy when I get there
Gonna dance all over them hills
Don’t know why I ever left there
Must have been out of my mind
For staying away from the mountains
When I wanted to go back all the time

In this fair land you’ll stay no more
Here labor is in vain
You’ll leave the mountains of our birth
And seek the fertile plains
You’re going to the west
   You say you will not go with me
   You turn your eyes away
   You say you will not follow me
   No matter what I say
   I’m going to the west
The years have passed since we first met
When you became my bride
Now I must journey far away
Without you by my side
I’m going to the west
You’ll leave me here, in this land I love
Mid scenes so bright and fair
Where fragrant flowers are blooming
And music fills the air
You’re going to the west

Gonna write me a letter
Gonna send it on the foam
Gonna send it to my baby
Gonna beg him to come home
He wanted me for to marry
My papa he said no
Said that he didn’t like him
Told him that he would have to go
He’s gone he’s gone
I led him down to the water
Watched him sail away on a boat
Left me there broken-hearted
Broken-hearted and all alone
He’s gone he’s gone
Gonna write me a letter
Gonna send it on the foam
Gonna send it to my baby
Gonna beg him to come home
He’s gone he’s gone

Darling, how can I stay here without you
I have nothing to cheer my poor heart
This old world would seem sad, love, without you
Tell me now that we’re never to part
I will pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you’ll love me again
Take back all the gifts you have given
But a ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It’s a face that is false, but is fair
Tell me why that you do not love me
Tell me why that your smile is not bright
Tell me why you have grown so cold-hearted
Is there no kiss for me, love, tonight

From old Montana down to Alabam’
I’ve been before and I’ll travel again
Your triflin’ women can’t keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play
Now hit the road and be on your way
I’m gonna board the golden rocket and leave this town
I was a good engine a-running on time
But baby I’m switchin’ to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I’m tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one-way ticket and I won’t be back
This golden rocket’s gonna roll my blues away
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That’s your cue and by now you know
That I got another true love a-waitin’ in Tennessee
This midnight special’s a-burnin’ the rail
So woman don’t try to follow my trail
This golden rocket’s a-rollin’ my blues away
That old conductor he seemed to know
That you done me wrong I was feelin’ low
For he yelled alound We’re over that Dixon line
The brakeman started singin’ a song
Said “You’re worried now but it won’t be long”
This golden rocket is leavin’ your blues behind
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl
Let’s rise and shine, good mornin’ ya all
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
As I kissed my baby in the station door
That whistle blew like it never did before
Of the golden rocket that rolled my blues away

My weary heart for you is crying
Getting old and paying for its dues
For you have left me oh so lonely
I’ve got those gone and left me blues
You know that we should be together
Though I’m the one that’s been untrue
Please take me back and say you love me
I got those gone and left me blues
I might have known that you’d be leaving
I knew you’d borne your walking shoes
Why did you break those vows of promise
And bring about those awful blues
Don’t say that you have gone forever
The nights are much to lonely now
Alone I hope that you’ll return dear
I’ve got to get you back some how

Since first we met somehow I knew
It wouldn’t last our whole life through
Now sure enough years later on
I look for you and you are gone 
 Gone but not forgotten
You’re still in my memory
Gone but not forgotten
I’ll stay right here till you come home to me. 
 One rainy night and a no good fight
When I woke you were outta sight
Now after all that we’ve been through
I thought I’d hear just once from you. 
 I search for you most every day
More sorry now than words can say
Maybe you don’t live in this world
But you’ll still be my only girl.

All of my friends that I loved yesterday
Gone home (they have gone home) gone home (they have )
The songbirds that sing in the dell seem to say
Gone home (they have gone home) gone home (they have )
   They’ve joined the heavenly fold
   They’re walking the streets of pure gold
   They left one by one as their work here was done
   Gone home (they have gone home) gone home (they have)
Life here is lonely since they’ve gone before
Gone home (they have gone home) gone home (they have )
The old weeping willow that stands by the door
Sadly says (they have gone home) gone home (they have )
The trumpet will sound on that Great Judgment day
Gone home (they have gone home) gone home (they have )
We’ll see all our friends that have gone on that way
Gone home (they have gone home) gone home (they have )

   I’m gonna lay down my old guitar
   Gonna lay down my old guitar
   Oh I wish I could tie it to my side
   And take it along with me
There’s no one to cry for me   
There’s no one to cry for me
I’ve wandered so far away don’t you see
And there’s no one to cry for me
I’m sick in a lonesome bed
I’m sick in a lonesome bed
There’s no one to hold my aching head
And I’m sick in a lonesome bed
I’m telling this world goodbye   
I’m telling this world goodbye
I’m telling the world and my dear little girl
I’ll soon tell them all goodbye

Tonight I’m all alone no place to call my own
Don’t have no one to love me anymore
I’m gonna pack up my grip and take a long long trip
Back to the one that I love so
   Oh I long to go back to my darling
   Back to the one I love so well
   I know she’ll be my wife and we’ll settle down for life
   Cause she’s the one that means the world to me
I can’t forget the day I left and went away
You told you me I’d be sorry some old day
I found it to be true so I’m heading back to you
Sweetheart I’m tired and I want to settle down
When I get back to her my rambling days are over
We’ll build a little cottage on the hill
We’ll think of days gone by sweetheart just you and I
And there we’ll live so happy ever more

Back in the days when I was a lad
There was only one thing that could make me glad
A good bunch of biscuits a good batch of biscuits
Mama could make mighty good gravy
And there was never no buts nor maybes
We’d get biscuits a good bunch of biscuits
Papa didn’t cuss but just a little bit
But if mama didn’t cook ’em he’d throw a big fit
Pass me them biscuits those High Life biscuits
And us little kids all sixteen of us
If mama didn’t make ’em you could hear us fuss
I want another biscuit a good bunch of biscuits
Three times a day seven days a week
We just couldn’t resist it
Clean up the plate that was our fate;
We didn’t leave a solitary biscuit
I don’t see how mama ever did make ’em
Enough to keep up with the way we ate ’em
A good bunch of biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits
I love a man sop red-eyed gravy
With a biscuit so light it’ll drive you crazy
A good bunch of biscuits a good bunch of biscuits
Most of us kids had our fingernails nipped
It was caused by grabbin’ them hot-fried biscuits
Goodness gracious they’re good biscuits
I turned eighteen I got me a wife
Oughtta be slapped for it the rest of my life
But I got biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits
If I ever get rich we’ll have a lot more
But I’ll keep eatin’ just like I was before
Goodness gracious they’re good biscuits
A good bunch of biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits
Goodness gracious I got biscuits

Along about round-up time In Texas way out West
I lost a friend and a pal, boys I laid him down to rest
I weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
‘Cause I knew down beneath that mound lay the best pal I ever had 
Oh de lady a, de oh lady oh, de ladie
My best pal was my old paint horse and now he’s gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out West
Where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky 
Dear old pal it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
Now I’ll go and ride the range on the Texas roan
But my love for you old pal it shall linger on
I will always think of you although you’re dead and gone

Goodbye to the pals of the prairie
Goodbye to the pals of the plains
Goodbye to the dash and the danger
Goodbye to the heartaches and pains
Goodbye to my faithful old pony
Take care of him, boys, when I go
I’m riding away on life’s roundup
Away to where the sun sinks low
Goodbye to the whoop-rushing cattle
Goodbye to the clanking of spurs
Goodbye to the laugh and the chatter
Goodbye to the wildlife and steers
Goodbye to the dawning’s first blushes
That fair in the east faintly glow
I’m riding away on life’s roundup
Away to where the sun sinks low
Goodbye to the girls and the boys
Goodbye to all of my friends
Goodbye to the dear girl, my sweetheart
For I know this is my end
For the pale rider comes with his summons
And I’m willing and ready to go
For I’m riding away on life’s roundup
Away to where the sun sinks low

Well I got my hands on the gospel plow
And I wouldn’t take nothin’ for my  journey now
Keep your hands on that plow of  God
Hold on hold on
Keep your hands on that plow hold on
Well Matthew Mark Luke and John
All those prophets are dead and gone
Keep your hands on that plow of God
I never been to heaven but I’ve been told
The streets up there are made of gold
Keep your hands on that plow of God

   I’m going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
   I’m a-going far beyond the sky
   I’m gonna shout and sing ‘til heaven rings
   When I hid this world goodbye
I have good news to bring, and that is why I sing
All my joys with you I’ll share
I’m going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
And go sailing through the air
I can scarcely wait, I know I won’t be late
I’ll spend my time in prayer
And when the ship comes in, I’ll leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air
If you are ashamed of me, you ought not to be
Yes, you’d better have a care
If too much fault you find, you will sure be left behind
While I’m sailing through the air
When I bid this world goodbye

   I’ve laid around and played around this old town too long
   Summers almost gone, winters coming on
   I’ve laid around and played around this old town too long
   And I feel like I’ve gotta travel on
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can’t come home
Johnny can’t come home, no, Johnny can’t come home
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can’t come home
Cause he’s been on the chain gang too long
High sheriff and police riding after me
Riding after me, yes, coming after me
High sheriff and police riding after me
And I feel like I’ve gotta travel on 
Want to see my honey, want to see her bad
Want to see her bad, oh, want to see her bad
Want to see my honey, want to see her bad
She’s the best gal this poor boy ever had

Come and listen to my story if you will I’m gonna tell
About a gang of fellars down at Nashville
First I’ll start with old Red Foley doing his Chatanooga Shoe
We can’t forget Hank Williams with his Good Lord Lovesick Blues
It’s time for Roy Acuff go to Memphis on his train
Minnie Pearl and Rob Brassfield with Lazy Jim Day
Turn on your radio I know that you will wait
Hear Little Jimmy Dickens sing ‘Take An Old Cold Water and Wait’
There’ll be guitars and fiddles and banjo pickin’ too
Bill Monroe singing out them Old Kentucky Blues
Ernest Tubb’s number Two Wrongs Won’t Make a Right
At the Grand Ole Opry every Saturday night
There is Uncle Dave Macon his gold tooth and plug hat
Cowboy Copas singing Tragic Romance
Signed Sealed and Delivered with Sam and Curt McGee
And the master of ceremony is the Mr.George D. Hay
There is Lonzo and Oscar a-poppin’ bubble gum
George Morgan singing Candy Kisses yum yum
Got a hole in my bucket bringing in that Georgia mail
We’ll play the Bluegrass Breakdown and dance to the Chicken Reel
You can talk about your singers in all kinds of way
But none could sing the old songs like Bradley Kincaid
With his old hound dog Buitar and the famous ‘Blue tail fly’
Stringbean and Hank Snow and fiddlin’ Chubby Wise

Looking through old memories in my cedar closet stashed away
I found the old mandolin Grandpa used to play
I picked it up and held it close thinking ’bout those years ago
And all the great music Grandpa made
Weathered worn but never frail with calloused hands he gently played
To bring an easy feeling to a hard working day
When times were tough as they could be he never once complained to me
He’d just let the music sooth the the pain
When Grandpa played the mandolin the family gathered ’round
To sing the old time songs generations handed down
I remember every single phrase from every song he played
Wish I could sing a song with Grandpa today
I recall 1961 the year Grandpa passed away
The family gathered ’round once more to sing Amazing Grace
Now this mandolin’s reminding me of what my Grandpa taught to me
That music makes the world a better place

There are songs that birds don’t sing to people
There are secrets you keep right through to the end
There are heros they hide until forever
And I’m singin’ this song for one of them
He’s the man that you passed on the road there
The one with his life on the loose
Goin’ either somewhere or nowhere
Goin’ without me without you
For he is this world’s constant orphan
Travelin’ out his long time
Livin’ on apples from orchards
And dyin’ from grapes on the vine
You can find him in big city winters
Out where the mission bell crys
And sorrow echos through the suburbs
And tries to close all his eyes
And dream of his railroad existance
As if it were some kind of dream
As if the extent of the distance
Were what his heart would go him
You can find him in Pittsburg at Christmas
You can find him in Buffalo in June
And he knows all the back roads between them
Like a Gypsy he pulls a broom
And it’s route twenty-two all over again
Stake it well down and try to look like sombody’s friend
Look strong at the men smile for the girls
Puzzle at the rest of the world

There’s a grave in the bend of the valley
Where the shadows sweep over so still
There my darling is sleeping so peaceful
In a grave at the foot of the hill
On the night when I’m lonely and thinkin’
Of my sweetheart who’s now gone away
I go back to the place where she’s sleeping
I’m just longing to see her some day
God gave us the joy that we wished for
Just a few nights together to be
Then he carried her to heaven’s bright portal
There where she will be waiting for me
For I often go back to the valley
Where the willows weep over her head
There to be just once more with my darling
By her side though I know she is dead

There’s a little grave on the green hillside that lies to the morning sun
And the way worn feet often wander there when the cares of the day are done
We sometimes sit in the twilight fall and talk of a far off land
And we sometimes feel in the twilight there the touch of a vanished hand
   Grave on the green hillside grave on the green hillside
   In the years to come we will calmly sleep in a grave on the green hillside
And this land is full of these little graves in the valleys plains and hills
There’s angel too for each little grave an angel procession fills
I know not how but I sometimes think that they lead us with gentle hand
And a whisper falls on a willing ear from the shore of a far off land
And these little graves are but wayside marks that point to a far off land
And they speak to the soul of a better day of a day that’s near at hand
Though we first must walk through the chartless fields yet Christ will be our guide
We will reach the shore of a far off land through a grave on a green hillside

Troubles and trials often betray those
Causing the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still water
With the good shepherd leading the way
   Going up home to live in green pastures
   Where we shall live and die never more
   Even the Lord will be in that number
   When we have reached that heavenly shore
Those who have strayed were sought by the master
He who once gave his life for the sheep
Out on the mountain still He is searching
Bringing them in forever to keep
We will not heed the voice of the stranger
For he would lead us on to despair
Following home with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair

Oh the green rolling hills of West Virginia
Are the nearest thing to Heaven that I know
Though the times are sad and drear
And I cannot linger here
They’ll keep me and never let me go. 
My Daddy said don’t ever be a miner
For a miner’s grave is all you’ll ever own
Cause of hard times everywhere
I can’t find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I’ve ever known. 
So I’ll move away into some crowded city
In some northern fact’ry town you’ll find me there
though I’ll leave the past behind
I’ll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear 
But someday I’ll go back to West Virginia
To the green rolling hills I love so well
Yes, someday I’ll go home
And I know I’ll right the wrong
These troubled times will follow me no more
Yes, someday I’ll go home
And I know I’ll right the wrong
These troubled times will follow me no more.

Standing on the sidetrack at the south end of town
on a hot dry dusty august day the steam pipe pouring down
the fireman with his long oil can oiling the old valve gears
waiting for the semaphore the fast mail train to clear
The engineer in the old high cab his gold watch in his hand
looking at the waterglass and letting down the sand
rolling out on the old main line taking up the slack
gone today so they say but tomorrow he’ll be back
oh if I could return
to those boyhood days of mine
and the greenlight on the southern southern railroad line
creeping down the rusty rails of the weed grown branch line
the section houses gray and white by the yard limit sign
the hoggers call the old high ball no more time to wait
rolling down to birmingham with a 10 car load for freight
the whistle scream with a hiss of steam the headlight gleams clear
the drivers roll on the green and go getting mighty near
handing up the orders to the engine crew on time
it’s the Alabama great southern AGS railroad line

Way down yonder in the forks of the branch
Way down yonder in the forks of the branch
The old sow whistles and the little pigs dance
Groundhog, groundhog
Well come on Grandpa get your dog
Come on Grandpa get your dog
We’re going up the holler to catch a groundhog
Groundhog, groundhog
Well yonder comes Jimmy with a ten foot pole
Yonder comes Jimmy with a ten foot pole
Twist that groundhog out of his hole
Groundhog, groundhog
Well come on Pappy bring your gun
Come on Pappy bring your gun
We got that groundhog on the run
Groundhog, groundhog
Well yonder comes Sally with a snicker and a grin
Yonder comes Sally with a snicker and a grin
Groundhog grease all over her chin
Groundhog, groundhog

On the Tom Big Bee River so bright I was born
In a hut made of husks of the tall yellow corn
It was there that I first met my Julah so true
And I rowed her around in the gum tree canoe 
    Sing row away row o’er the waters so blue
    Like a feather we’ll float in my gum tree canoe
    Sing row away row o’er the waters so blue
    Like a feather we’ll float in my gum tree canoe 
All day in the fields of soft cotton I’d hoe
And think of my Julah and sing as I go
I’d catch her a bird with a wing of true blue
And at night row her around in the gum tree canoe
With my hand on my banjo and my toe on the oar
I would sing her a song to the river’s soft roar
While the bright stars shone down on my Julah so true
And they danced in her eyes in the gum tree canoe 
One day the old river took us so far away
That we couldn’t get back so we thought we’d just stay
We spied a tall ship with a flag of true blue
And she took us in tow in the gum tree canoe

If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn’t worry me half as much as you do
You’re nice to me when there’s no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn’t stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never feel so blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

   Hallelujah (I’m ready) I’m ready (Hallelujah)
   I can hear the voices singing soft and low
   Hallelujah (I’m ready) I’m ready (Hallelujah)
   Hallelujah I’m ready to go
   
In the darkness of night not a star was in site
On a highway that leads down below
But Jesus came in and saved this soul from sin
Hallelujah I’m ready to go
Sinners don’t wait before it’s too late
He’s a wonderful Savior you know
Well I fell on my knees and he answered my pleas
Hallelujah I’m ready to go

I was walkin through the darkness on a cold and lonely night
The shadows gripped at everything and held them from my sight
The trees gave way to moonlight on the hills beyond my gaze
And my eyes caught sight of something there in the foggy midnight haze
The air was damp the night was cold and quiet deathly still
I climbed up through the grey moonlight and stood upon that hill
What I’d seen from down below before me now did lay
It was a handmade cross with stones around to mark a six foot grave
The cross was rough and made of wood a worn and weathered pine
Bound together tightly with bits of wire and twine
The weeds grew up between the stones that marked that narrow grave
And I wondered who so long ago had in this ground been laid
We know now what became of him, but not from where he came
Were his last days filled with loneliness with sorrow or with pain
And who was left behind to grieve and make this humble tomb
And who has come before me to his place of final doom
How did he make his way in life will in death he do the same
Was his soul possessedof goodness of sorrow or of shame
And does this cross above him mean he was a christian man
Or did he believe this earthly death for him would mean the end
I stood there in the silence and felt a deathly chill
Wonderin’ if my own short life could end upon some hill
With noone left behind to make a place for me to lay
With a handmade cross and stones around to mark a six foot grave

Well I wish was in London
Or some other seaport town
Step my foot in a steamboat
And sail the ocean round
   Sailing round the ocean
   Sailing round the sea
   I’d think of Handsome Molly
   Wherever she may be
I saw her at church last Sunday
She passed me on by
I knew her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye
Her hair as black as a Raven’s
Her eyes were black as coal
Her teeth shown like lilies
Out in the morning cold
Now do you remember Molly
When you give me your right hand
Said if you ever married
I’d be your man
Now you’ve broke your promise
Go marry whom you please
My heart is broken
‘Til I get some ease

Oh does your concience ever bother you
Every time you hear my name
Oh try to think of all that I’ve gone through
And hang your head in shame
Someone came along and took my place
Then you gave me all the blame
Oh you should go somewhere and hide your face
and hang your head in shame
Now when you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game
Oh try to think of all the harm you’ve done
And hang you head in shame
I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I’ve kept a flame
Dear you’ll be sorry darling yes you will
And hang your head in shame

I wondered today on the sea shore
The waves and the winds are low
I thought of the days gone by Maud
Many long years ago
We lingered by the gently flowing billows
And watch the golden sunset fade away
And there among the sweet ocean breezes
We talked about our future wedding day
   Gathering up the shells from the sea shore
   Gathering up the shells from the sea
   Those were the happiest days of all Maud
   Gathering up the shells from the shore
When the waves are rolling on the ocean
And the golden moonbeams on the pebbles shine
At your cottage by the sea I’ll come again Maud
When the waves are rolling gently sweetheart mine
Now I am growing up in years Maud
My locks are all silver and gray
But the vows that we made on the shore Maud
Are fresh in my memory today
No more bright shells we will gather
As the waves come dashing as of yore
She lies neath the white pebbled sand
Just covered up with shells on the shore

Jesus come and hold my hand
While I walk this rocky road
Travellin’ to a better land
Where my friends will meet me I know
   Oh I’ll soon (yes I’ll soon) be on my way (be on my way)
   Seems every time (seems every time) I kneel to pray
   I hear my friends a’callin me
   In the home above (in the home above) happy I’ll be
I’m so tired and all alone
But I must keep travellin’ on
I‘ll keep goin’ until I die
I’ll meet my friends (I’ll meet my friends) up there on high
When I reach that home on high
And bid my troubles on earth goodbye
I’ll be glad this life is o’er
This rocky road (this rocky road) I’ll walk no more

   I am happy in a prison
   Yes, I’m happy anywhere
   In my soul my savior’s risen
   Of 10,000 he is fair
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Sinners lay your burdens down
Glory, glory, hallelujah
For a cross receive a crown
When the food is low and failing
And the children bare for clothes
I look up to father’s healing
For I know my savior knows
Any cost, a fire is burning
And its coming draweth nigh
But I’m happy, always happy
Though in prison I must die

I want to thank Jesus for the way that I feel
I’m so full of religion I just can’t be still
I want to sing it and shout it and let the people know
That I’m saved by his mercy and I’m ready to go
   (That’s why I’m Happy) Yes I’m happy happy on my way
   (Rejoicing and singing) His praises everyday
   For Jesus is near me and there he will stay
   (That’s why I’m happy) Yes I’m happy happy on my way
I just can’t see why you sinners go on
Livin’ in sorrow doin’ so wrong
Hidin’ your face from the savior above
Denying yourself his wonderful love
What a wonderful feeling just to know I am saved
And the Savior will guide me ’til I enter the grave
And then he will greet me at heaven’s open door
And I’ll live in glory with Him forever more

Come back to me in my dreaming
Come back to me once more
Come with the love light beaming
Like in the days of yore
I wonder if you still love me
And if your heart is still true
When the spring roses are blooming
Then I’ll come back to you
   Somewhere a heart is breaking
   Calling me back to you
   Memories of loved ones waiting
   Each happy home and you
   
   Absence makes my heart fonder
   Is it the same with you
   Are you still happy I wonder
   Or do you feel lonesome too
When the sun is sinking
In the golden west
And the birds and flowers
They have gone to rest
Come tell me that you still love me
And that your heart is still true
When the spring roses are blooming
Then I’ll come back to you

There’s a sunny side where no ills betide
There’s a road that we must go
There is pleasant vales verdant hills and dales
Where sweet flowers ever grow
   Oh the happy (happy) sunny (sunny) pretty rolling dales
   Where the sweetest gladness ever there prevails
    (sweetest joy and gladness ever there prevails)
   Where the sunshine lingers on the hill
    (sunshine ever lingers on the grand majestic hills)
   On the sunny side of life
    (on the happy sunny side of life)
There’s shady dells where no gladness dwells
And the clouds obstruct the view
But a brighter way like the light of day
Is awaiting now for you
Let us sing a song as we go along
Let us banish care and strife
That the world might know as we onward go
There’s a sunny side of life

There’s coming a time on the great judgement morning
When the Savior will welcome you home
Will you be prepared for the journey to heaven
On the great ship that carries God’s chosen ones home
   Oh the waters’ so deep on the river of Jordan
   And the lite shines so bright from heaven above
   And the midnite is past a new day is dawning (from heaven on high)
   Oh the great ship will anchor in the harbor of love.
If you’re wandering in sin away from God’s teaching
Won’t you ask him to show you the way
Fall down on your knees in the chapel next Sunday
And meet all your friends in heaven some day

First time I seen my true love
He was walkin’ by my door
The last time I saw his false hearted smile
Dead on his coolin’ board
It’s hard and it’s hard ain’t it hard
To love one that never did love you
Hard and it’s hard ain’t it hard great God
To love one that never will be true
There is a house in this old town
That’s where my true love lays around
Takes other women right down on his knee
Tells them a tale that he won’t tell me
Don’t go to drinkin’ and to gambling
Don’t go there your sorrows to down
This hard-liquor place is a low-down disgrace
The meanest damn place in this town

In the hard game of love I’m the last one to fall
But I gave it my heart and I gave it my all
I didn’t know that she played a game with no rules
So I climbed aboard the old ship of fools
 And it’s a lonesome old world, my sweetheart is gone
I can’t sleep at all. And I pray for the dawn
It’s the last time I’ll hurt, it’s the last time I’ll cry
When I lay down tonight, gonna lay down and die
In the still of the night as the lonesome wind blows
My sanity wanes; it comes and it goes
I feel like a child in a house all alone
Whose mother and dad will never come home

   Hard hearted heart breaker
   Dream stealer, love maker
   Hard hearted heart breaker
   How many hearts have you broken today
How many hearts have you broken today
How many lives have you caused to go wrong
How many hearts have you broken in two
Just because your heart has proved untrue
How many lies have you told other guys
Just like the ones you told to me
Honey, someday you’ll learn that the tide will have to turn
Just keep on breaking hearts and you will see

While on this old earth Lord I’ve suffered I’ve cried
Things don’t work out Lord as hard as I’ve tried
I’ll have up in glory a crown for my prize
But knowin’ my luck Lord it’ll be the wrong size
    Hard luck in Heaven please say it ain’t so
    Cause down here on earth Lord it’s all that I know
    When I’m in my mansion will the roof leak there too
    Hard luck in Heaven please say it ain’t true
I’ve always been hard luck it’s always been true
So I’m not expecting any different from you
When I get my wings Lord they won’t fit me right
I’ll be flappin’ in circles o’er the city of light
Now Lord please forgive me for thinkin’ this way
But hard times just haunt me each night and each day
When the angels start singing and they hand out the harps
Knowing my luck Lord mine’ll be tuned too sharp

Oh darling I can’t stay here
Oh darling I can’t stay here
For there’s nothing here but a hard rocking chair
Oh darling I can’t stay here
I wish I had her tied to my side
I wish I had her tied to my side
If I had her by my side
we’d run away and hide
I wish I had her tied to my side
I wish I was a birdie in the spring
I wish I was a birdie in the spring
Like a birdie in the spring
I could hear my darling sing
I wish I was a birdie in the spring
So darling you know you done me wrong
So darling you know you done me wrong
You done me wrong
I’m leaving you this song
So darling you know you done me wrong
I wish I was a little turtle dove
I wish I was a little turtle dove
Like a little turtle dove
I’d fly to the one I love
I wish I was a little turtle dove

Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count the many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times come again no more
   It’s a song a sigh of the weary
   Hard times hard times come again no more
   Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
   Oh hard times come again no more
Though we seek mirth and beauty and music bright and gay
They are frail forms a-waiting by our door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading seems to say
Oh, hard times come again no more
It’s a sigh that is wafted across the lowly plains
It’s a wail that is heard upon the shore
It’s a dirge that is murmured across the lonely grave
Oh hard times come again no more

I’ve been doing some hard travelingI thought you knowed
I’ve been doing some hard traveling way down the road
I’ve been doing some hard traveling hard drinking hard gambling
I’ve been doing some hard traveling Lord
I’ve been doing some hard rock mining I thought you knowed
I’ve been leaning on a pressure drill way down the road
Well the hammer flying and the air hose sucking
And six feet of mud and I sure been a ducking
And I’ve been doing some hard traveling Lord
I’ve been riding them fast passengers I thought you knowed
I’ve been hitting them flat wheelers way down the road
I’ve been ridin’ them blind passengers dead enders
kickin’ up cindersI’ve been doing some hard traveling Lord
I’ve been layin’ in a hard rock jail I thought you knowed
I’ve been layin’ out ninety days way down the road
Darned old judge he said to me it’s ninety days
for vagrancy And I’ve been doing some hard traveling Lord
I’ve been doing some hard harvesting I thought you knowed
From North Dakota to Kansas City way down the road
Cutting that wheat and stacking that hay trying to make a dollar a day
And I’ve been doing some hard traveling Lord
I’ve been walking that Lincoln highway I thought you knowed
I’ve been hitchin’ on sixty six way down the road
Got a heavy load got a worried mind looking for a woman that’s hard to find
And I’ve been doing some hard traveling Lord

There’s a rabbit in the log and I ain’t got my dog
How will I get him I know
I’ll get me a briar and twist it in his hair
That way I’ll get him I know
I know ( yes I know )
I know ( I surely know )
That’s how I’ll get him I know
I’ll get me a briar and twist in his hair
That way I’ll get him I know
I’ll build me a fire and I’ll cook that old hare
Roll him in the flames and make him brown
Have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
And find me a place to lie down
To lie down ( to lie down )
To lay down ( to lay down )
Find me a place to lie down
Have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
And find me a place to lie down
I’m going down the track and my coat ripped up my back
Soles on my shoes are nearly gone
A little ways ahead there’s an old farmer’s shed
That’s where I’ll rest my weary bones
Weary bones ( weary bones )
Lazy bones ( lazy bones )
That’s where I’ll rest my weary bones
A little way’s ahead there’s an old farmer’s shed
That’s where I’ll rest my weary bones

Have you come to say goodbye my darling
Was the love you promised just a lie
Why go on pretending any longer
Tell me have you come to say goodbye
Now as I gaze into your eyes tonight dear
You act so cold and strange i wander why
Could it be that you know longer want me

An old Jane about 49 came in to view the town
She registered up at Smith’s Hotel as Miss Ada Brown
She said she was just 25 and that she was in love
With a young lad about 16, she called him her turtledove
The wedding day at last arrived, the birds did merrily sing
He touched her up for a hundred to go out and buy the ring
   He never came back, no, he never came back
   He’s been gone for a year or more
   That sassy young thing better have that ring
   When we meet on that beautiful shore
I went down to a restaurant as hungry as a bear
And a raving thief I did, I grabbed the bill of fare
The waiter said, now what for you, a piece of steak, I said
He taken my order and bowed his head and slowly walked away

   Oh Willie my darling come back
   I will ever be faithful and true
   Oh Willie my darling come back
   I’ll forever be faithful to you
I remember once that he said
He loved me better than his life
He called me his darling his wife
Then asked me to be his own bride
Oh darling he said I am sure
Your heart is made of a stone
He took a white rose from my hair
Then left me a standing alone
 The next fateful day Willie was dead
He was found in the pond near the mill
Oh the clear precious waters so fair
That flows from the branch of the hills
His blue eyes were forever closed
And damp was his golden hair
And close to his pale lips was found
The white rose he took from my hair

Upon the rugged cross of Calvary
Was there my blessed Savior cried
Forgive them for they know not what they do
Oh, sinner friend, for thee he died
   His hands are gently knocking on your door
   Outside he’s pleading to come in
   His heart is breaking as he waits for you
   To wash you free from every sin
Someday he’s coming back to claim his own
We’ll fly to Heaven’s golden shore
A crown of life he gives on that glad day
With him we’ll live forever more
Those cruel thorns they pierced my Savior’s head
The blood was flowing down his face
In shame, forsaken there he hung and died
Oh, sinner friend, he took you place

There’s a call that rings from the throne it springs
To those now gone astray
Saying “Come ye men from your load of sin
There at the altar lay”
Many do not heed that the chains of greed
that their conscience never tire
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire
Now if you don’t from sin retire
He will set your fields on fire
You have heard Jesus’ call
And in death your soul must fall
Now my friend if you desire
You may join the heavenly choir
And rejoice with him free from every sin
When He sets this world on fire
You have heard his voice seen His soul rejoice
That trusted in his grace
You have blushed with sin as He knocked within
But still you hide your face
From the blessed Lord and His own true word
But still you say retire
Leave the downward path kindle not His wrath
Or He’ll set your fields on fire

Let not your heart be troubled for He will take you in
His invitation stand forever more
He’s right there where you let Him to take you by the hand
And lead you to that everlasting shore
   He’ll take you in He’ll take you in and give you shelter from the storm
   He’ll take you in He’ll take you in and there your mortal life transform
   How can you be so down and out you should jump right up and shout
   He’ll take you in He’ll take you in He’ll take you in
Let not your soul be weary for He will strengthen you
Even in the weakest times you’ll find
Him reaching out his arms to lift you up again
You know He’ll take you in every time
You’ll be walking on the water with your feet on hallowed ground
If you have the faith to follow in His will
You’ll be one with the Spirit the Father and the Son
He’ll deliver you sanctified and sealed

Have you ever been to the head or the holler
That’s where the big dogs romp and waller
The women there are long and lean
And some I fear are apt to be mean
Roll on head out
You’ll like it there’s no doubt
There ain’t no better place to be
Than the head of the holler in Kentucky
The first time I went to the head of the holler
I wore a bow tie and a snow white collar
When daylight came come crawlin’ in
And the best thing I wore was a silly grin
The next time I went to the head of the holler
I saw more moon that I could swaller
I flew like a bird and a tryin to sing
‘Til I fell from a tree and broke one wing
Now my gal lives in the head of the holler
Her love shines like a silver dollar
She feeds me butter staight from the churn
And her ma and pa don’t give a durn
I’m a going back to the head of the holler
You can go too if you want to follow
But don’t you fool with that gal of mine
I’ll cut you down like a lonesome pine

I think I’ll go across the ocean
If I don’t change my notion
I’ve just got to forget you if I can 
   I’m feeling so blue
   I don’t know what to do
   Because I’m
   head over heels in love with you 
Every day is sad and lonely
For I’m thinking of you only
I just can’t sleep when I lay down 
Oh I’d like to be forgiven
But this life ain’t worth living
If have to sit and worry over you 
Oh the nights are long and dreary
All I do is sit and worry
I just can’t bear the thought of losing you

Pretty girls that treat you nice
Headin’ back to Arkansas
Kiss ’em once they’ll kiss you twice
Headin’ back to Arkansas
Had a place to sleep at night
Headin’ back to Arkansas
I had shoes that fit me right
Headin’ back to Arkansas
    Cross the mountains like a crow
    Where I’ll fly she’d never know
    Where my frozen heart will thaw
    Headin’ back to Arkansas
    Headin’ back to Arkansas
Goin down the railroad track
Got a biscuit in my pack
You can hear a mountain song
You’ll go dancin’ all night long
Peaches growin on the trees
Melons taller than your knees
Singin’ while you do your chores
Neach the oak and sycamore

Well I got a home on the other shore
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
I know I’ll live there forever more
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
    Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan, don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
    Thank God there’s a Heaven and a ringin’ in my soul
    and my soul set free
    Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
Well now Sister Mary she wears a chain
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
And on every link is a Jesus’ name
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
The devil wears a hypocrite shoe
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
you don’t watch out he’s gonna step ’em on you
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
Now the Methodist preacher is a mighty fine man
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan
Showin’ us the way to the promised land
Don’t you hear Jerusalem moan

    Heart and soul mind and body
    We were as close as close can be
    Heart and soul mind and body
    Now I feel pain in every part of me
We found love and whirlwind romance
The feeling was right and the passion strong
Love was a thrill and satisfying
How could we know it would somehow end
Your feelings changed you found another
Some things about me you can’t accept
I tried to change but I can’t forget her
We grew apart and then love soon left
 

There came from the skies
In the days long ago
The Lord with a message of love
The world knew Him not
He was treated with scorn
This wonderful Gift from above
   They crowned Him with thorns
   He was beaten with straps
   He was wounded and nailed to the tree
   But the pain in His heart
   Was the hardest to bear
   The heart that was broken for me
He came to His own
To his owners He loved
The sheep that had wandered astray
They heard not His voice
But the Friend of mankind
Was halted and driven away
I will take up my cross
I will walk by His side
For the pathway of duty I see
I will follow my Lord
And abide in His heart
The heart that was broken for me

Way up north where the snow flies and the sun don’t hardly shine
If it weren’t for my true love
I’d a long a go lost my mind
I’d long a go lost my mind
There are good folks here and good folks there most everywhere I go
But the land of my heart is down
Where the snow white cotton grows
Where the snow white cotton grows
   When the river runs over from meltin’ snow
   We will take to the higher ground
   When the water goes down again
   We’ll saddle our old Paint
   We’ll be homeward bound
   Me and my love will be homeward bound
Heartstrings hang tighter than the roots of a live oak tree
Holdin’ thru tornado winds
Tougher than timber stronger than steel
They’ll guide me back southward again
They’ll guide me back southward again

There’s a wonderful invention called the radio
You can hear it every where you chance to go
But the static in the air sometimes makes it hard to hear
But it is not so with heaven’s radio
   Heaven’s radio on the other shore
   For my precious savior always listens in
   It’s the same old radio that was used long time ago
   For my precious savior always listens in
Daniel in the lions den with this power should surely win
For my precious savior always listens in
And I know without a doubt honest prayers will bring you out
For my precious savior always listens in
Well He set the Hebrews three from the fiery furnace free
For my precious savior always listens in
He will rescue you today in that same old fashioned way
For my precious savior always listens in

On Saturday night when our work is done
We load our music up on the run
   Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
   We got to ramble ramble there’s heavy traffic ahead
We pull out of Nashville right on time
The Blue Grass special heads down the line
We traveled around from state to state
The Bluegrass boys are never late
Late in the evening about sundown
You know we’ve come from some other town
We do our work with a good will
On Friday night we head for Nashville

That we’re sad without her here
   Hello central give me heaven

Kiss me through the telephone

   Hello, city limits, I see your sign
   Left all my worries way behind
   Left all my troubles and heartaches there too
   Hello, city limits, I’m starting out brand new
I need a change of scenery, I need it real bad
To help me forget all the hard times I’ve had
I’ve got a feeling I’ll find a love that’s true
Well, hello city limits, I’m starting out brand new
I haven’t told a soul just where I’m gonna be
Cause I don’t want the blues to catch up with me
I may decide to change my name too
Hello city limits, I’m starting out brand new

Now hello stranger put your loving hand in mine
Hello stranger put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger
But you’re a pal of mine
Now get up rounder let a working may lay down
Get up rounder let a working man lay down
You are a rounder
But you’re all out and down
Every time I ride that six and fourth street car
Every time I ride that six and fourth street car
I can see my baby
From here behind these bars
She bowed her head she waved both hands at me
She bowed her head she waved both hands at me
I’m prison bound
I’m longing to be free
Oh I’ll see you when your troubles are like mine
Oh I’ll see you when your troubles are like mine
Oh I’ll see you
When you haven’t got a dime
Weeping like a willow and mourning like a dove
Weeping like a willow and mourning like a dove
There’s a girl in the country
That I really love

Thinking of you while out for a ramble
Down by a cold frosty stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
And gently I fell into a dream
I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty I’d never saw before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So green was the mantel she wore
Her hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was as ivory so white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Or stars than shine on a cold frosty night
I drew her near then I awakened
With two empty arms and you on my mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to know you left me behind

Thirty days now I’ve been gone out here in this world alone
But I can hear her sweet love’s calling me
We’re a thousand miles apart but she’s here in my heart
Cause I can hear her sweet love’s calling me
Her sweet love’s calling me
And her lonely arms keep reaching for someone that she needs
The teardrops are falling on my cheeks
Cause I can hear her sweet love’s calling me
I remember how she cried the day I said good-bye
Now I can hear her sweet love’s callling me
I don’t know why I ever roamed leaving love like her’s at home
But I can hear her sweet love’s calling me

Here today and gone tomorrow
Our love will always be a hit and run affair
I know you love me but you’re just a wanderer
Today I love you but tomorrow I may not care
   For absence never makes the heart grow fonder
   I get lonesome for someones company
   Here today and gone tomorrow
   And my loving you is just a fantasy
When you’re gone I wish we’d never met
For your memory remains within my heart
Here today and gone tomorrow
We can’t be happy so I guess it’s best we part

Hey hey hey bartender
come and set me up another round
Hey hey hey bartender
got a lot of troubles I must drown
Well I guess you guess it’s love
it’s love it’s love it’s love it’s love bartender
Yes I guess you guess this love has got me down
I tried I tried bartender Lordy Lordy Lordy how I tried
She Lied she lied bartender
Lordy how that woman went and lied
Well I guess it’s best somehow but now I’m alone
I’m alone I’m alone bartender and I see you see it hurts to be alone
Del McCoury; I wonder Where You Are Tonight

I saw you last night in my dreams love
I awoke as the clock was strikin’ four
But I didn’t think that I’d meet you
And now as you walk through the door
   Come sit here with me, little darlin’
   And allow me to say
   I love you sweetheart I love you
   Hey hey hey hey
As you stood there before me I wondered
If I’d ever get you off of my mind
And the tears filled my eyes when you vanished
With your golden curls that hung down behind
Won’t you come back to me in my dreams love
Some dark night when I’m here all alone
Would you tell me sweetheart that you love me
Some dark night when I’m here all alone
 

Oh thy blessed rock of ages
Trusting now dear Lord in thee
Keep me til my journey’s ended
Til they blessed face I’ll see
    Hide me oh blessed rock of ages
    Til they face I’ll see
    When the storms around me

I can see the sad expression you were trying to disguise
You gave away your secrets with that look that’s in your eyes
You don’t have to tell me what you did it comes as no surprise
You don’t have to give your heart to hideaway
   Hideaway, hideaway
   In my arms you’ll find a safer place to stay
   If you’re looking for a refuge where you can hold the world at bay
   Come to me if you just need a hideaway
It seems each time you’d meet somebody you were sure your dreams came true
You never stopped to think she might not be so good for you
You make the same mistakes but I’ll be here to tell your troubles to
When it’s over come to me and hideaway

When ever my soul is lonely
When ever I’m feeling blue
I start thinkin’ ’bout my blue-eyed darlin’
My heart starts pinin’ for you
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound
‘Cause my sweet baby ain’t around
When my life’s got me down
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound
When I’m lost in this ocean of darkness
Not knowing which way I should turn
And my eyes are filled with the sadness
Of knowing you’ll never return
Vince Gill; High Lonesome Sound

High on a hilltop overlooking a city
I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you’re dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream
High on a hilltop my heart cries oh Lord
Forgive her she know not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we’ll pray
I can vision a rounder with a life so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you’re silly with booze
And high on a hilltop I see a devil win you

As I looked at the valleys down below
They were green just as far as I could see
As my memory returned oh how my heart did yearn
For you and the day that used to be
   High on a mountain top wind blowing free
   Wondering about the days that used to be
   High on a mountain top standing all alone
   Wondering where the years of my life have flown
Oh I wonder if you ever think of me
Or if time has blotted out your memory
As I listen to the breeze blow gently through the trees
I’ll always cherish what you meant to me

With these Highway 40 blues
I’ve walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I’ve been gone
And I’d love to see the lights of home
Wasted time and money too
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I’d have to lose
Lord above, I’ve paid my dues
I’ve got them Highway 40 blues. 
 The highway called when I was young
It told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead
That’s what the billboard light had said
Shattered dreams my mind is numb
Money’s gone stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain’t been home in years
I got them Highway 40 blues. 
 You know I rambled all around
Like a rolling stone from town to town
Met pretty girls I’d have to say
But none of them could make me stay
I’ve played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
Things a country boy can’t use
Dixie land I sure miss you
I’ve got them Highway 40 blues.

   Ain’t talking, just walking
   Down that highway of regret
   Heart’s burning, still yearning
   For the best girl this poor boy’s ever met
I never thought this thing could happen
I never thought you’d be untrue
Or go away with another
And break a heart that worshipped you
It makes no difference where I wander
You never seem to leave my mind
Your face is always there before me
I think about you all the time

I once had a darling wife kind, true and sweet
Life was so bright and gay everything complete
But I fell for another who led my life astray
So I’ll live in sorrow till my dying day
   Down the highway of sorrow I’m traveling alone
   I’ve lost all my true friends I’ve lost a happy home
   I’m heading for destruction I’m on the wrong track
   Down the highway of sorrow there’s no turning back
I went back to my darling I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
So I’ll live in sorrow as I long as I live

Headin back to the hills and home
This old country never more to roam
This travellin’ life is not for me
I’m heading back to the hills and home
Like many other wanderin lads
I went away my fortune to see
It’s all the same but now I know
My fortune’s here among the hills and home
I can smell the mountain laurels bloomin’
Along the road that leads up to my home
That stand of oak out behind the shed
Makes me long for the hills and home
There’s a light shining from the window
The smoke is curlin from the chimney top
Mom and dad about their evening chores
I’ll soon be back among the hills and home
 

There ain’t much that’s left here that ain’t all run down
Gone are the echoes of old familiar sounds
Families have scattered parted and gone
Left a lot of good things to wither away back home
Can’t you feel those hills around you
Can’t you feel that touch of home
Don’t you wish you’d never gone
There are some things memories can’t bring home
Hills of home hills of home
Families scattered off and gone
These old hills that have been passed by
Well they’ve seen their share of leavin’ in their time
Old familiar dirt roads winds through the piney glade
Where all the longings of childhood dreams were made
Where we passed the mossy mounds where I could run and play
Never a care to cross my mind all the livelong day

In the beautiful hills, way back in Roane Country
There’s where I roamed for many long years
There’s where my heart’s been tending most ever
That’s where the first step of misfortune I made
I was about thirty years when I courted and married
Amanda Gilbraith I then called my wife
But her brother stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three months later I’d taken Tom’s life
For twenty five years this whole world I rambled
I went to old England to France and to Spain
But I thought of my home way back in Roan Country
I boarded a steamer and came back again
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in the county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next morning
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor mother stood weepin
And sister she sat alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was Willie God bless you
Was Willie God bless you, God bless you, good bye
Sweet Martha was grave but Corey was better
There’s better and worse, although you can see
Boys when you write home from the prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for me

From what I’ve been a hearing dear you’ve really got it made
You’ve got a lot of fellers on your lover’s hit parade
If I can’t be your number one I don’t know what I’ll do
Gonna be plumb up to the top I’m so in love with you
   On the hit parade of love I know I’ll never stop
   I’ve got a long long way to climb before I reach top
   But if I do get there soon I’d really have it made
   Then I’ll know I’m number one your lover’s hit parade
Now it’s your heart I’m after ’cause it’s so nice and kind
Another one to take your place would sure be hard to find
So put your arms around me dear and be my turtle dove
Then I’ll feel like I’m number one on your hit parade of love
Now if we work together like all good lovers should
We can make a go of it everything will turn out good
We will can so much fun we’ll really have it made
Then I’ll know I’m number one on your lover’s hit parade

Riding on an east bound freight train speeding thru the night
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold
No warm lights flicker ’round him no blankets there to fold
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreary kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay
Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcare door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped thru the darkness and the raging storm outside
No-one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride
It was early in the morning when they raised the Hobo’s head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother’s longing to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold

I got a hole in my pocket
I done packed my old knapsack
I got a train to catch a mile on down the track
Well I been hanging around this old town way too many days
I got to ramble on and I must be on my way
I got the hobo blues
I gotta go gotta go God I got the hobo blues
When I hear that whistle blow some
I gotta move gotta move God
I got the hobo blues
Some women try to hold me but I keep on movin’ on
My hat don’t hang in nowhere for too long
‘Cause I’m caught up in the feeling of the singin’ brakemans song
I got the hobo blues deep down in my bones
When I die oh won’t you bury me in an old box car
With a coffee can and my old guitar
But make sure that I’m close enough to hear that passin’ train
I got the freight train fever chuggin’ through my veins

Kneel down by the side of your mother, my boy
You have only a moment I know
But stay till I give you this parting advice
It is all that I have to be stow 
   Hold fast to the right, hold fast to the right
   Wherever your footsteps may roam
   Oh forsake not the way of a salvation my boy
   That you learn’d from your mother at home 
You leave us to seek your employment, my boy
By the world you have yet to be tried
But in the temptations and trials you meet
May your heart to the Savior confide 
I gave you to God in your cradle, my boy
And I’ve taught you the best that I knew
And as long as His mercies permit me to live
And I shall never cease praying for you 
You will find in your satchel, a Bible, my boy
It’s the book of all others the best
It will help you to levee and prepare you to die
And will lead to the gates of the blest

Time is filled with swift transition
Naught of earth unmoved can stand
Build you hopes on things eternal
Hold to God’s unchanging hand
   Hold to God’s unchanging hand
   Hold to God’s unchanging hand
   Build you hopes on things eternal
   Hold to God’s unchanging hand
Trust in Him who will not leave you
What so ever years may bring
If by earthly friends forsaken
Still, more closely to Him cling
When your journey is completed
When the valley you pass through
Fair and bright the home in glory
Your enraptured soul will view

   Hold whatcha got, I’m a-coming home baby
   Hold whatcha got, and I don’t mean maybe
   Been a-thinking about you and I’m on my way
   Don’t sell the house, and don’t wreck the car
   Stay there, honey, right where you are
   Hold whatcha got, I’m a coming home to stay
Well… in my mind I can see
That’s a pretty good sign that I need you
That’s why I can’t wait to get back home
So squeeze yourself real good and tight
I’ll be there before daylight
If you hold whatcha got, I’m a coming home to stay
Well… when I get back, honey, I ain’t leaving
I been too long, a little too much grieving
When I get back this time I’m going to stay
Well we won’t fuss and we won’t fight
This time things is gonna be all right
If you hold whatcha got, I’m a-coming home to stay

Home still rocks my soul
Steals my dreams each night
I never thought I’d be turnin back
To a light that burns so bright
   I’m goin back where my heart still lives
   Back to my dear old friends
   When they reach out with welcome arms
   It’ll be my journey’s end
I still remember the night
We sang sweet country songs
We laughed at the good times, cried at the bad
And life just rolled along

There’s a lonely cottage by the sea side
Where the water lillies through the shore
It was there I passed my happy childhood
With a loved one that’s gone before
   Then give me back my dear old home
   That old home by the sea
   And I never will wander far away
   From my home my dear old cottage home
   Yodel
Many years have passed since there I wandered
But the old cottage has been forgot
And my heart in fancy oft returned
To that dear old familiar spot
Yes my heart is like the humming sea shell
That tells of its birth where ere it roams
I will sing of my cottage by the sea shore
Of my home my dear old cottage home

   Oh lord have mercy on this weary soul of mine
   May I walk in your light everyday
   And when I’ve crossed that deep silent river
   I’ll be happy in that home far away
I wandered away from the straight and the narrow
Driftin’ like a ship lost at sea
No lighthouse to guide my weary footsteps
Til Jesus answered my plea
The lights are bright no longer I’m blinded
From the bondage of sin I’m free
He lifted me up to join salvation
I’ll live on eternally

All the neon lights were flashin’ and the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes and the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red his hopes were dead and the wine was runnin’ low
Then the old man came home from the forest
His tears fell on the sidewalk as he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare but no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway and a bottle his only friend
And the old man stumbled in from the forest
Up a dark and dingy staircase the old man made his way
His ragged coat around him as upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened that he ended up this way
Gettin’ lost like a fool in the forest
And as he lay there sleepin’ a vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining the face of one so dear
Who’d loved him in the springtime of a long forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom in the forest
She touched his grizzled fingers and she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside in some forgotten town
Where the river runs down from the forest
With a mighty roar the big jets soar above the canyon streets
And the common con but life goes on for the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier the dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home from the forest

   Oh yes I’m going back to my home in Tennessee
   Back to the girl that’s waiting in the cotton fields to see
   There’s a mother and a dad that’s waiting patiently
   And the place I’m longing for tonight’s my home in Tennessee
I’ll sail the skies in airplane to a place called Bunkers Hill
I’ll drop from the clouds in a parachute and oh boys what a thrill
My song shall fall in no mans land and I’m in the great prairie
But the place I’m longing for tonight’s my home in Tennessee
I’ve been to Frisco’s Golden Gate also Bangor, Maine
I’ve been to the Rocky Mountains and back down again
And up to old New York saw the Statue of Liberty
But the place I’m longing for tonight’s my home in Tennessee

When I was young I couldn’t see
How much the old town had meant to me
But it’s too late to mourn and cry
As long as I live this old town will never die
It ain’t fair in our home town
When people tear our buildings down
This old town won’t be the same
Seems as tho it’s an awful shame
The family church house is torn down too
And we’ve all been wondering what will we do
To find another would be kind of hard
But we will all cherish pleasant memories serving God

Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
I wonder if they miss me while I roam
I wonder if they pray for the boy who went away
And left his dear old parents all alone
   Now you can hear the cattle lowing in the lane
   You can see the fields of bluegrass where I’d roam
   You can almost hear them cry as they kiss their boy goodbye
   I wonder how the old folks are at home
Just a village and a homestead on the farm
And a mother’s love to shield you from all harm
A mother’s love so dear and a sweetheart brave and true
Just a village and a homestead on the farm

   Well I ain’t got no honey baby now
   I guess she didn’t love me anyhow
   Well it’s oh me and oh my
   Ain’t got no honey baby now
Well she left me on that early morning train
I’ll never see my girl again
Well it’s oh me and oh my
Ain’t got no honey baby now
Now good girl you ain’t no gal of mine
My honey babe done traveled down the line
Well it’s oh me and oh my
Ain’t got no honey baby now
I’ll see you when your troubles are like mine
When you haven’t got a nickel or a dime
Well it’s oh me and oh my
Ain’t got no honey baby now

Oh my brother, do you know the Savior
Who is wondrous kind and true?
He’s the Rock of your salvation
There is honey in the Rock for you
   Oh, honey in the Rock (oh, honey in the Rock)
   Sweet honey in the Rock (sweet honey in the Rock)
   Oh it tastes just like honey in the Rock
   Oh taste and see if the Lord is good
   Oh it tastes just like honey in the Rock
Have you tasted that the Lord is gracious?
Do you walk in the way that’s new?
have you drank from the living fountain?
There is honey in the Rock for you
Oh, there’s honey in the Rock my brother
There is honey in the Rock for you
Leave your sins fur the Blood to cover
There is honey in the Rock for you

Honey you don’t know my mind I’m lonesome all the time
Born to lose a drifter that’s me
You can travel for so long then a rambler’s heart goes wrong
Baby you don’t know my mind today
Heard the music of a rail slept in every old dirty jail
And life’s too short for you to worry me
When I find I can’t win I’ll be checking out again
Baby you don’t know my mind today
I’ve been a hobo and a tramp my soul has done been stamped
Lord things I know I learned the hard hard way
I ain’t here to judge or plea but to give my poor heart ease
Baby you don’t know my mind today
Honey you don’t know my mind I’m lonesome all the time
Born to lose a drifter that’s me
You say I’m sweet and kind I can love you a thousand times
Baby you don’t know my mind today

Where did you get them high top shoes
And the dress that you wear so fine
Got my shoes from a railroad man
And the dress is from a driver in the mine
    Oh hop high hop high
    Hop high my lula gal
I’ll pawn you my watch and I’ll pawn you my chain
I’ll pawn you gold wedding ring
To pay my little lulu’s fine
I’ll pawn you my wagon and my team
Where have you been my pretty little girl
Where have you been so long
I’ve been in the pen with those rough and rowdy men
And honey I’m goin’ back again

Every minute of the day I’m thinking about you
And without you life is just a crazy dream
Every breath I take I’m hoping that you’re hoping
That I’m hoping you’ll return to me
Can you remember dear when you said
If I ever stopped loving you you’d rather be dead
Well dear I don’t know what on earth changed your mind
No matter whose holding you your heart is still mine
Every time I think about the way you cuddled up and spuddled up
And thrilled me with your charm
I get dizzy in the head and when it’s seeming that I’m dreaming
I’m locked in your loving arms

   Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
   Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
   Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
   Fare thee well Uncle Bill see you in the morning yes sir
Well it’s upstairs downstairs out in the kitchen (3x)
See you Uncle Bill just a raring and a pitching yes sir
Well it’s old Aunt Peggy won’t you fill ’em up again (3x)
Ain’t had a drink since the lord knows when yes sir
Well yonder comes the preacher and the children are a crying (3x)
Chickens a running and the toenails a flying yes sir

People steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don’t they know on judgement day
That gold and silver will melt away
I’d rather be in a dark grave
And to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not pure and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

I dreamed you were lying close beside me
And I dreamed no one else had your heart
In this dream you said you loved me
And told me that we’d never part
Oh how could I dream such a dream
How peaceful there while I sleep
But I awoke how strange it did seem
I was lost in a world so deep
You’ll never know just how much I love you
And that you’re in my prayers every night
But tonight you’re in the arms of another
And I know what I’m feeling ain’t right

In my memory there’s a little mountain homestead
And the flowers are still growing on the lawn
Now each time I go back home the tears start falling
How I miss my darling since she’s gone
She’s gone to join a happy band of angels
To sing for endless ages at God’s throne
The best friend I ever had is now with Jesus
How I miss my darling Mother since she’s gone
There’ll never be another friend like Mother
No one can do the things for me she done
Nor can fill the vacant place she left here
How I miss my darling mother since she’s gone

You only wanted me for your pastime
Someone to tell your troubles to
I tried so hard to make you happy
It made no difference dear to you
Now you don’t want to love me anymore
I’ve tried so many times before
I’ve tried and tried, oh how Ie’ve tried
I’ve tried you were never satisfied
It hurt me so when you left me
I never thought you’d be untrue
Or go away with another
And leave me lonsome and blue

Have you ever been so lonely so blue you could die
When the one you love no longer cares for you
When your trouble mind keeps bothering you won’t leave you alone
When you know its all over love’s grown cold
How lonely oh how lonely how lonely can you get
I’d give this wide world over If we had never met
I woudn’t have these lonely night days of sad regret
Don’t mind being lonely but how lonely can you get
I’ve tried to tell me my troubled mind to live and just forget
But I don’t find that so easy and never will I guess
I’m locked up in a dream world with dreams and loneliness
And every day I ask myself how lonely can you get

Long ol’ train cruel engineer
They took my baby and left me here
And how long will I keep these lonesome blues
How long how long
Has that evening train been gone
How long how long baby how long
Mean ol’ blues come down on me
They’re all around me they’re all I see
But how long will I keep these lonesome blues
Cruel engineer can’t you see
I need my baby back with me
Then I’d be rid of these mean ol’ lonesome blues

   How many times must we fight
   It goes on ‘til past midnight
   Day after day night after night
   How many times must we fight
You always say that I’m to blame
But you should hang your head in shame
Just because you’ve got the upper hand
This life I live is hard to stand
Your heart is surely made of stone
People like you should live alone
Oh you’ve kicked this old heart of mine around
A thousand times you let it down

   Get down boys, go back home
   Back to the girl you love
   Treat her right, never wrong
   How mountain girls can love 
Riding the night in the high cold winds
On the trail of the old lonesome pine
Thinking of you, feeling so blue
Wondering why you left me behind 
Remember the night we strolled down the lane
Our hearts were gay and happy then
You whispered to me as I held your close
You hoped this night would never end

You left me, my darling to travel alone
My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you’re not around
How will I explain about you
   How will I explain about you
   They know I’ve been faithful and true
   So when they start asking why you’re not around
   How will I explain about you
They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I loved you so true
But now that you’ve gone and I’m left all alone
How will I explain about you
   How will I explain about you
   I can’t let them know that we’re through
   They wouldn’t believe it could ever be true
   How will I explain about you
   How will I explain about you
   I’m leaving it all up to you
   And if you insist that our pathway must part
   How will I explain about you

I’ve had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There’s no hope for tomorrow
How’s the world treating you
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How’s the world treating you
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you’re away
Tho’ our pathways have parted
To your memory I’m true
Guess I’ll stay broken hearted
How’s the world treating you
Do you wonder about me
Like I’m hoping you do
Are you lonesome without me
Have you found someone new
Are you burning and yearning
Do you ever get blue
Do you think of returning
How’s the world treating you

Hush little baby don’t say a word
Mama gonna buy you a mocking bird
If that mocking bird don’t sing
Mama gonna buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond ring turn brass
Mama gonna buy you a lookin’ glass
If that lookin’ glass gets broke
Mama gonna buy you a billy goat
If that billy goat don’t pull
Mama gonna buy you a cart and bull
If that cart and bull turn over
Mama gonna buy you a dog named Rover
It that dog named Rover don’t bark
Mama gonna buy you a horse and cart
If that horse and cart fall down
You’ll be sweetest little baby in town

I’m goin’ back to the country, I can’t pay the rent
Though I’m not exactly broke, brother I’m sure bent
Can’t understand where my money went
I ain’t broke but I’m badly bent. 
Well, I had a lot of money, but to the city went
I met too many good looking girls and that’s where my money went
Yeah I know just where it went
No I ain’t broke but I’m badly bent. 
When I get back to the country I’ll be livin’ in a tent
Ma and Pa will sure be mad about all the money I spent
Can’t understand just where it went
No I ain’t broke but I’m badly bent 
Yeah I know just where it went
No I ain’t broke, but brother I’m badly bent.

I’m a’going to leave this country
I a’going around this world
I’m going to leave this country
For the sake of one little girl
Well she told me that she loved me
And it caused my poor heart grief
Now she’s got her back turned on me
And she’s courting whoever she please
Well I lost my money at gambling
And I lost my name you see
I am nobody’s darling
And nobody cares for me
Don’t you hear my banjo a’ringing
Don’t you hear it’s mournful sound
Don’t you hear those pretty girls laughing
Standing on the cold frosty ground
Well I’ll hang my head in sorrow
I will hang my head and cry
I’ll hang my head in sorrow
As my darling passes by
I ain’t gonna work tomorrow
And I may not work next day
I ain’t gonna work tomorrow
For it be a wet rainy day

Well I ain’t holding on any longer
Holding on to memories of the past
Well I ain’t holding on any longer
I know I just ain’t gonna last
    I can’t go on the way I’m livin
    Can’t stand the pain that I’ve gone through
    So I ain’t holdin’ on any longer
    Cause little gal I see I’m through with you
Well now you can get just what you wanted
And maybe just a little extra too
Take the money in the bank I don’t need it
For it’s gone like the love we once knew
    So I’ll take this and you take that baby
    You take that and I’ll take this that’s fine
    Ain’t no use to hold on I know it’s over
    So you go your way I’ll go mine

Tonight I’m all alone with all my memories
And this old heart of mine miust bear the pain
Now I can hear the raindrops softly falling
And I always get lonesome when it rains.
There’s something about the rain that makes me blue
‘Cuz when the raindrops fall I think of you
Now I can hear the patter on the pane
And I always get lonesome when it rains.
I’m glad there’s no one ’round to hear me cry
Nor to see me walk the floor like I’m insane
Now I can’t hide my sorrow no need trying
‘Cuz I always get lonesome when it rains.

   I am a pilgrim and a stranger
   Traveling through this wearisome land
   And I’ve got a home in that yonder city, good Lord
   And it’s not (good Lordy it’s not) not made by hand
I got a mother, a sister and a brother
Who have gone to that sweet home
And I am determined to go and see them, good Lord
Over on (good Lordy over on) that distant shore
As I go down to that river Jordan
Just to bathe my weary soul
If I could touch but just the hem of His garment, good Lord
I believe (good Lordy I believe) that it would make me whole
Now when I’m dead, laying in my coffin
All of my friends all gather round
They can say that he’s just laying there sleeping, good Lord
Sweet peace (Lordy sweet peace) his soul is found

    I am going in the morning
    And in glory I shall dwell
    In that home that’s free from sadness
    Where we’ll never say farewell
Friends this day I hope to meet you
In that home bye and bye
Then we’ll live up there forever
In that home beyond the sky
If you live for the Savior
He will walk by your side
And you’ll be with him forever
In that happy home on high

   Oh, I am the Man, Thomas, I am the Man
   Look at these nail scars here in my hands
They pierced me in the side, Thomas, I am the Man
They made me bear the cross, Thomas, I am the Man 
They laid me in the tomb, Thomas, I am the Man
In three days I arose, Thomas, I am the Man
They pierced me in the Side, Thomas, I am the Man
They made me bear the cross, Thomas, I am the Man

   Kiss me mother kiss your darling
   Lay my head upon your breast
   Fold your loving arms around me
   I am weary let me rest
Through the years you’ve always loved me
And my life you’ve tried to save
But now I will slumber sweetly
In a cold and lonely grave
Now the light is swiftly fading
Brighter scenes they now do show
I am standing by the river
Angels wait to take me home

Oh you said that you loved me that your heart would be true
But now you’ve gone and left me, I’m so blue
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you’ve gone and left me, I’m so blue
   Our vows have been broken, you have proven untrue
   Another has my sweetheart and the love that I once knew
   I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
   But now you’ve gone and left me I’m so blue
Oh the nights are so lonely, dreams of you haunt me so
What’s happened little darling I don’t know
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you’ve gone and left me I’m so blue

I can hear the angels singing
As I walk this rocky road
For my thoughts are all of heaven
And my Savior’s blest abode
I can hear the angels singing
I can hear my Savior’s voice
And I’ll soon be singing with them
Through endless ages we’ll rejoice
I can hear the angels singing
Of my Savior’s blessed love
How he died to build a mansion
For his children up above

This world is not my home I’m just-a-passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from Heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore
Oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If Heaven’s not my home oh Lord what would I do
The angels beckon me from Heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore
They’re all expecting me that’s one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago
I know he’ll take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore
Just over in the gloryland there’ll be no dying there
The saints all shouting victory and singing everywhere
I hear the voice of those that’s gone on before
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore

The flame of love to ash has burned
My faded love will not return
You want me back I know it’s true
But I can’t go on loving you
    I can’t go on loving you
    Can’t stand the pain you put me through
    Torturing my mind with the things you do
    No I can’t go on loving you
I wish you happiness sweetheart
It hurts to know we have to part
I’ll think of you and the love we knew
Oh I can’t go on loving you

When you left me you said you’d return dear
You said that you’d be back someday
Oh please let me hear from you darlin’
I just can’t go on this ol’ way
   I know you never did love me
   But I thought that you would dear someday
   Oh please let me hear from you darlin’
   I just can’t go on this ol’ way
Remember the good times together
You said that you loved me so true
As I sit here these thoughts hover o’er me
There’s a love in my heart dear for you

I used to get so restless when I stayed at home
Couldn’t stand the sight of me alone
And to stay the same was moving backwards more than standing still
To ramble ’round was my greatest thrill. 
    I can’t stand to ramble no more
    I’d rather count the flowers growin’ at my door
    I’d rather sit and think of places I have been before
    I can’t stand to ramble no more. 
 I used to have this driving desire to be out on the road
Now it’s just another weary load
And the wanderlust that used to burn is faded to a glow
In a longing for the sweet things that I know. 
 This life’s got me goin’ places I have been before
I hear the wolves howlin’ at my door
I’d like to settle down with the best man that I know
And make some sweet old memories of our own.

I don’t drink as much as I used to
I’ve learned when to get out of the rain
I don’t sleep anymore since you left me my dear
And I can’t stop calling your name.
   I call your name in the middle of the night
   I sit up in my bed wanting to hold you so tight
   But when I realize that things are not the same
   Maybe then I’ll stop calling your name.
Our house don’t seem to be empty
Oh the laughter and scent of you remain
Everything in our room reminds me of you
That’s why I keep calling your name.

Last night I told my heart’s love
All under the pale blue sky
Eagerly waiting an answer
I plainly could read in her eyes
I love you sweetheart I love
And ask you to be my bride
Her face turned pale and she trembled
And sadly to me she replied
   I cannot be your sweetheart
   I cannot stay by your side
   One is waiting up yonder
   One that’s claiming his bride
   
   My heart is almost broken
   Your vows only add to my pain
   I love you sweetheart I love you
   Though we may never meet again
We said goodbye in the moonlight
My heart was turned to stone
One blissful hour was made happy
But now I’m sad and alone
In this my sorrows forever
Though you may go far away
Where ever you go I’ll love you
But still I can hear you say

Dear when I think about you I could cry
Knowing I have let love go by
I’ll just stay at home and always wonder why
Every time I see your picture I could cry
I could cry an ocean of tears
But what good would it do
I’ll just keep your memory as years go gy
But when your name’s mentioned darling I could cry
I don’t know what this cruel world holds for me
But it really doesn’t matter now you see
For when day is done and twilight hovers night
Then I miss your arms around me I could cry

I couldn’t win because she did not love me
She just pretended as she kissed me then
And then about the time I really loved her
She left me and I knew I couldn’t win
I’m thankful for the happiness she gave me
I wish that I could fall in love again
I don’t blame her I guess I’m just unlucky
But from the start I knew I couldn’t win
Tonight I sit here drinking in this tavern
And as I order up the drinks again
I see her smiling sweetly at another
If only he just knew that he can’t win
A broken heart she must have had in childhood
Now she’s afraid it might happen again
She’s really not to blame for all my heartaches
But from the start I knew I couldn’t win

Teardrops fell the night you said
I love you dear and you were wed
I watched you while you held his hand
Then bowed my head and cried again
   I cried again when I reached home
   There set your picture all alone
   I thought of things that might have been
   And bowed my head and cried again
I took your letters from the shelf
Then read them aloud just to myself
And just before I reached the end
I turned away and cried again
I thought of love I’d been denied
And how to hold it I had tried
And of dreams that we had shared
And days gone by when you cared
   Now here’s the reason why I say
   That I must throw your things away
   For they would always bring my pain
   And then I’d have to cry again
   And then I’d only cry again

Love it’s not I who didn’t try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I’m saying goodbye
I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough 
    Love you don’t see
    The pain in me
    It’s plain enough, plain enough
    You’re never here to catch the tears
    I cried for us, I cried for us. 
I’ll take my share,
But I’ll be fair
There’s not much stuff, easy enough
And if you choose, I’ll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough 
I’ve tried and tried to put aside
A time to talk, but without luck
So I’ll just pin this within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked 
And this is why I’m saying goodbye
I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough.

   I don’t know why it is that I love you
   I don’t know why it is that I cry
   You have gone and now you love another
   That’s why I cry I don’t know why.
There was a day a sunny day
When you declared your love for me
But now you’ve turned from me away
Your childish vows no more I’ll see.
When summertime has come and gone
You’ll need a friend who’s heart is true
You’ll find yourself so all alone
And then you’ll know what I’ve gone through.

Well I don’t nobody nobody loves me
All they want’s my money they don’t care for me
I want to live single happy and carefree
I don’t love nobody nobody loves me
One day I went out walking walking down Johnson street
I met a little old lady she smiled at me so sweet
Said hello my honey how are you today
Just as I started to kiss her these words I heard her say
One day I went out walking walking down Johnson street
I met the same little lady she was dressed up so near
She smiled at me and said hello how are you today
Tipped my hat and said hello and journeyed on my way

   I don’t want your rambling letters
   Don’t want your picture in a frame
   All I want is you in person
   Won’t you let me change your name
Mama said you’d come home soon
Papa warned me not to wait
Sister thinks that you still love me
Hurry home right away
I’m so tired of long distance kisses
Love by mail is all so cold
I just want you in my arms dear
Then our love just can’t grow ol

Just like old times you were here last night
And gone were my sorrows and cares
Just like old times you were gone and I
Had a dream of an old love affair
   I was alone in the darkness my dear
   Many dreams ago you left me there
   Sunlight told me you were gone and I
   Had a dream of an old love affair
Life’s been so empty since you’ve been gone
I love you with all of my heart
Heaven was mine when you smiled last night
And said we could make a new start

Like many times before when I awoke this morning
It seemed that all the world had turned it’s back on me
I couldn’t find nobody who wore a friendly smile
My burdens finally got me on my knees
    But I feel I better now since I stole away to Jesus
    I feel better now way down in my soul
    When I awoke this morning the skies looked mighty gray
    But I feel better now since I prayed
Sometimes I get the feeling I never should be tempted
When I think this old world should be a friendly place
But then when I get careless or cold and unconcerned
My Savior lets me know its time to pray
So when your heart is troubled and burdened down with care
And when temptations rise that seem to hard to bear
Just put your trust in Jesus He won’t turn you away
You’ll come out smiling every time you pray

Though the miles are between us, I thought our love would strengthen
As it had, so many times before
But something has happened, I can see it in your writing
I can tell my world is crumbling and the blues are at my door
   The last letter that you wrote was on a blue piece of paper
   That old feelings back, the clouds are moving in
   The beginning of the end is near I feel your love is fading
   In the darkness, it seems I have no friend
   I feel the blues moving in
Oh it’s not the words you wrote that left me sad and broken hearted
Or put me in this sad shape I’m in
Between the lines and mixed emotions are the teardrops on the paper
You said that’s all I write you now I’ll close for now old friend
My state of mind is desperate as the hole that I’m sinking in
Gets deeper while I’m digging to get out
Oh please give me the right answer to the question I’m asking
Tell me you still love me it would turn my world around

Once again dear it’s rose time it’s June time
All the flowers they bloom as of you
And the robin’s sweet song is singing
As I walk here to greet you once more
A year has passed here since I came here
This old love of ours to renew
And I found you among the roses
The day I come back to you
   I found you among the roses
   The day I come back to you
   All my gladness was there in a garden so fair
   Was the happiest moment I knew
   
   Your lips were the color of roses
   I pray them as flowers pray the dew
   It is there dear in your rose garden
   Where I found you
I remember the kiss that you gave me
For your cheeks like the rose flushed red
Twas a kiss dear that meant two for me
For all the harsh words I have said
Red roses a blooming around me
I loved every one of them too
For it was there dear in your rose garden
Where I found you

You’ll own a part of me my dear forever
Some things you give can never be returned
The flame of love that once burned oh so brightly
Is growing dim and how my poor heart yearns
Maybe it will break into tomorrow
But I’ll remember only yesterday
And if my life is filled with pain and sorrow
I guess it’s only right that I should pay

Last night while I lay sleeping
Last night while in a dream
I saw my dear old mother
Down by a misting stream
   Don’t ask me why I’m weeping
   Don’t ask me why I pray
   For I’ve an aged mother
   Ten thousand miles away
A letter here from sister dear
Come home we’re all alone
Dear mother’s slowly fading
She cant be living long
Yodel
Out in the cold world
Long ways from home
I’m drawing near the old home
Dear sister’s at the gate
She’s leading me through the doorway
Oh brother you’ve come to late
   Oh lead me to the casket
   Through back the linen so fine
   That I may kiss her pale white lips
   For I know they’ll never kiss mine
I see the pale moon shining
On mother’s whitened stone
The rose buds round them twining
Are just me all alone
Yodel
Out in the cold world
Left all alone

I hear the low winds sweeping
Through every bush and tree
Where my dear mother’s sleeping
Away from home and me
    Cold in the grave she’s lying
    And sorrow shapes my brow
    She’s gone from me to Heaven
    I have no mother now
I see the pale moon shining
On mother’s white tombstone
With roses o’er entwining
They’re just like me and her
    They’re just me a weeping
    As sorrow shapes my brow
    She’s gone from me to heaven
    I have no mother now
Sad was the hour of parting
In a voice so low and sweet
She said loved ones I’m dying
We must in Heaven meet
    Oh yes we’ll meet dear mother   
    On that eternal shore
    And dwell as one in Heaven   
    Where parting comes no more
    Oh yes we’ll meet dear mother   
    On that eternal shore
    And dwell as one in Heaven   
    Where parting comes no more

It was on last Sunday evening
Just about the hour of three
When my darling started to leave me
And sail on the deep blue sea 
He promised to write me a letter,
He promised to write to me;
And I haven’t heard from my darling,
Who is sailing on the deep blue sea 
My mother is dead and buried
My father’s forsaken me
And I have no one to love me
But the sailor on the deep blue sea 
“Oh, captain, can you tell me,
Can you tell me where he may be?”
“Oh yes, my little maiden,
He’s drownded in the deep blue sea” 
Farewell to friends and relations
This is the last you’ll see of me,
I’m going to end my troubles
By drowning in the deep blue sea

While walking one day in the country
I saw a gathering crowd
And as my footsteps drew me closer
I smelled the sweet fragrance of flowers
It looking like a family reunion
had my eyes not counted the tears
And an old man sat by a graveyard
I haven’t seen Mary in years
Hold to my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary
I haven’t seen Mary in years
When Mary and I were first married
we had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started rambling
and like the four winds I just went wild
If I could live my life over
I would bring Mary such cheer
Now she’s gone where she’ll never meet me
I haven’t seen Mary in years
Then the old man left the graveyard
and I walked right by his side
I called his name but through all his shame
his son he did not recognize
Hold to my hand and lead me
lead me away from here
How could I know it was Mama
I haven’t seen Mary in years

   I hear a choo choo coming
   It’s coming down the track
   It’s taking away my darling
   Never to bring her back
My darling left me this morning
She left me feeling so blue
I’m a going to roll, rock, and ramble
Try to forget all about you
I know I can’t forget her
So I won’t ever try
I’ll go through life a wondering
Until the day I die

Our little girl taken sick one evening
As she walked home from school
And in her death bed soon lingered
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both then go
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in heaven on high
God has made room for you daughter
Oh mommy and daddy don’t cry
Take care of my little brother
Tell him I’ve gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He’s all that you have left
Then she closed her eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darling
On that bright and peaceful shore

   I hear a voice calling
   It must be our Lord (it must be our Lord)
   Its coming from heaven on high
   I hear a voice calling
   I’ve gained a reward (I’ve gained a reward)
   For the land where we never shall die
The savior who died, on cruel Calvary
He shed His life blood that the world might be free
So follow His footsteps, up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day
The savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I’ll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
I’ll pay my debt on the great judgment day
Then she closed her eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darling
On that bright and peaceful shore

My friends have gathered here around me
They know I’ll soon be on my way
To live up there with Christ forever
That love-ly land far away
I hear my savior now a callin’
He bids me now to come home
I’ll stead-ly follow in his footsteps
I know he’ll guide me safely home
In this world we’re only strangers
We have sinned and all done wrong
But if you’ll kneel in prayer my brother
At jour-ney’s end he’ll call you home
I’m rea-dy now for the journey
I know I’ll soon be on my way
Sweet an-gels voices now will guide me
Oh hea-ven can’t be far away

While kneeling by her bedside in a cottage on the hill
My mother prayed her blessings on me there
She was talking there to Jesus while everything was still
and I heard my mother call my name in prayer
   Yes I heard my mother call my name in prayer
   She was pourin out her heart to Jesus there
   Then I Gave my heart to him and he saved my soul from sin
   For he heard my mother call my name in prayer
She was anxious for her boy to be just what he ought to be
And she asked the Lord to take him in his care
Just the words I can’t remember but I know she prayed for me
For I heard my mother call my name in prayer
So I gave my heart to Jesus and I’m livin now for him
And someday I’ll go and meet him in the air
For he heard my mother praying and he saved my soul from sin
Yes he heard my mother call my name in prayer

I’ve been away for just a year
Have you forgotten me my dear
The judge said I must pay the cost
I never knew how much I lost
Until they send me far away
Where each minute seems a day
But maybe someday I’ll be free
Will you be waiting there for me
I’m in this cell because of you
The crime I did you drove me too
My jealous heart just could not stand
To see you with another man
I hope someday that you will learn
And broken hearted you return
But listen darlin’ please don’t wait
For maybe then will be too late

When you left me you said you’d return dear
You said you would be back some day
Oh please let me hear from you darling
I just can’t go on this old way
I know you never did love me
But I thought that you would dear someday
Oh please let me hear from you darling
I just can’t go on this old way
Remember the good times together
When you said that you loved me so true
As I sit here the stars hover o’er me
There’s a love in my heart dear for you

   Oh how I once longed for your loving
   Your cheating I couldn’t realize
   But now that I’ve found out you’re stepping
   I’m through with you baby I’ve got wise
I know now you never cared about me
I think you’ve been lying all the time
Go back to that wild crowd your used to
You go your way and I’ll go mine
You asked me to meet you on the corner
You told me that we had things to do
And after I stood there and waited
You never showed up and I’m so blue

It makes no difference where I wander
No matter what I say or do
I can’t outlive this memory of you
I cry dear when I think of you
   Somehow you wouldn’t let me love you
   The plans we’ve made have gone astray
   Instead of being blue and lonely
   I just think I’ll go away
It seems we both could have been happy
If things had only turned out right
From now on each day I’ll think about you
I’ll dream of you dear every night

   I know what it means to be lonesome
   And I know what it means to be blue
   I know what it means to be lonesome in dreams
   When there is no one at home for you
Well my baby left me this morning
As the clock was striking four
The sweet smiling face of my darling
I may never see any more
Well I’ve cried and I’ve cried since we parted
No one knows what I have been through
You know I’d give all I own just to have you back home
I’m lonesome, lonesome for you

I left my gal in the mountains left her standing in the rain
Went down to the railroad caught myself a midnight train
I beat my way into Georgia landed in a gambling town
Got myself into trouble shot a county sheriff down
The jury read the verdict murder in the first degree
The judge said take this prisoner to the penitentiary
They put the handcuffs on me put me on a pullman tain
Took me to Atlanta boys and tied me to a ball and chain
I left my gal in the mountains left her standing all alone
Last night I dreamed I got a letter saying honey won’t you come back home
She said she was sad and lonely told me that her love was true
Then I dreamed I wrote her a letter saying honey I’m coming back to you
When I woke up this morning lying in Atlanta jail
No one here to love me no one to go my bail
Them prison bars all around me a guard walking by my door
My heart is sad and lonely boys cause I’ll never see my gal no more

My buddies tell me that I should have waited
They say I’m missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the christian life
I won’t lose a friends by heeding God’s call
For what is a friend who’d want me to fall
Otheres find pleasure in things I despise
I like the christian life
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I am happy though it burdens my soul
And I’ll try to lead them to walk in the night
I like the christian life

The day’s are so lonely the night are so long
Our home is a prison since you are gone
And I’ll always wonder why our love didn’t last
With no hope for tomorrow I’ll live in the past
A door that won’t knock a phone that don’t ring
The postman goes by and he don’t leave a thing
A pain in my heart and tears in my eyes
My sweetheart has gone I’m left here to cry
I’m the biggest pretender you ever could see
I pretend you still love me false love couldn’t be
And then I remember and I know that its true
For your with another and I know I’ve lost you
I’ll just go on dreaming sweet dreams of the past
Of when you still love me and I thought it would last
But life is so short and time moves so fast
I’ll never forget you as I live in the past

I saw a man a – walkin’
His hands were in his pocket
His head was hangin’, lookin’ at his feet 
Well he looked up and saw me
And asked me for a quarter
Or if I knew a good cheap place to eat 
Well I just shrugged my shoulders
Said, “If I could help you brother
I wouldn’t be out walkin’ on the street 
With nothin’ more to say
Just turned and walked away
Hopin’ for a richer man to meet. 
   I long for the old home
   I long for the hills
   Swingin’ on the front porch
   Lord knows I ain’t had my fill. 
Well I left home at fifteen
With a guitar and a dream
And a heart that needs learnin’ more of life 
I never had a job long
I never was the kind
To settle down forever with a wife 
I may have met some men
That you read about in books
And there were times that I was livin’ right 
But I ain’t got much to show
Here livin’ on skid row
No one to help this old man through the night.

Now tonight as I write this note to you
There’s sorrow in my heart
I hate to say goodbye my dear
But it’s better that we part
   Don’t think that I’ve grown tired of you
   Or found somebody new
   For you were all I’ve ever had
   And I love no one but you
Now when you read this note my dear
I hope you’ll understand
And think of the one that loves you best
This broken hearted man
Now that I have loved and lost
I hope you’re satisfied
It’ll be so hard to go through this world
With a broken heart inside

Our hands are clasped while as forever
Perhaps we’ll never meet again
I loved you as I loved no other
This parting fills my heart with pain
   As through this weary world I wander
   My thoughts alone will be of you
   In memory I will see you ever
   I loved you better than you knew
You asked and freely I’ll forgive you
The happy past I must forget
And while I wander lone in silence
I hope that you’ll be happy yet
Perhaps when I am gone forever
You’ll sometimes sit and think of me
And wonder if I’m dead or living
Perhaps I’ll think the same of you

   Go now don’t wait
   Please don’t hesitate
   Lovin’ you was my great sin
   And I might take you back again
For a long time the world stood still
I loved you then and I always will
But to me you’ve been untrue
There is nothing I can do
Well here you are you’re back again
I know that I just can’t win
You broke my heart most every day
And now you best be on you’re way

I needed you when I met you
You were just playing around
While I painted dreams of our everlasting love
You were just painting the town
Then when you said it was over
I found the heart good and true
Now that it’s too late you’ve discovered
You needed me like I needed you

I never knew how much I miss you
I never knew all the tears that I’d cry
Day after day I learn my lesson
You meant forever when you said good-bye
Last night I went out walkin’
By the café where I first met you
I sat there in the shadows
Watching young lovers do what we used to do
I keep a letter you wrote me
Sayin’ that we’d never part
One day when I find another
I’ll tear it to pieces like you did my heart

Onward to the eastern skies
With blueing effort kiss the seas
I sigh in place for those blue eyes
That have hope and love for me
   For they obey have stolen away
   That heart that truly once was mine
   Like some lone bird without a mate
   My weary heart is desolate
   I look around but cannot trace
   One welcome word or smiling face
   In gazing crowds I am alone
   Because I never loved but one
Come up closer to me now
Your chestnut hair’s been touched with snow
But still it is the same dear face
I loved so well long years ago
   The same as on that winter night
   You bent to me and kissed my brow
   Happy hours of trusting love
   Oh well they’re all over now
   
   And I must sail the whitening foam
   Till I can see the foreign home
   Til I forget that lasting face
   I ne’re can find a resting place
   
   I look around but cannot trace
   One welcome word or smiling face
   In gazing crowds I am alone
   Because I never loved but one

One morning as I rambled all down the seashore
The wind it did whistle, and the waters did roar
I heard a fair damsel make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around 
   I never will marry, or be no man’s wife
   I expect to live single all the days of my life
   The shells in the ocean shall be my death bed
   The fish in deep water swim over my head 
She plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her blue eyes in the waters to sleep
My love’s gone and left me, the one I adore
She’s gone where I never will see her anymore

   No I’m not living I only exist
   How much longer can I go on like this
   You broke my heart and tortured my mind
   I’ve lost you darling you’re long gone this time
My home is broken you wrecked my young life
You left me here alone to cry
These tears that are flowing will soon dry away
And some day darling I know you will pay
I knew you were no good right from the start
My friends all told me you’d break my heart
When your roaming and rambling days are through
You’ll pray for a love like I had for you

I saw a man at the close of day
standing by a grocery door
His eyes were sunken his lips were parched
And I viewed him o’er and o’er
His little son stood by his side
And unto him he said
Oh father mother is sick at home
And sister cries for bread
He turned around went in at the door
He staggered up to the bar
And faltering on to the landlord sayin’
Just give me one dram more
A year or so I passed thereby
And a crowd stood round the door
When I asked the reason one replied
The drunkard is no more
Just then a hearse moved slowly by
No wife nor children near
They had gone before this foul murder
And left this world of care
Come all you jolly dram drinkers
By this a warning take
And quit the overflowing bowl
Before it is too late

I wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
I wouldn’t let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
   I saw the light I saw the light
   No more darkness no more night
   Now I’m so happy no sorrow in sight
   Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw your face in the moon honey
You threw a smile at me
You pretended that you were happy
But in those loving eyes I could see
You were having blue thoughts of by gone
Days you and I once knew
But I could see you smile
And you faded with the blue
When I saw your face in the moon honey
When I saw your face in the moon

At my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind will come
sweethearts walk by together
and I still miss someone
   Tho I never got over those blue eyes
   I see them everywhere
   I miss those arms that held me
   When all the love was there
I go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but I find a darkened corner
cause I still miss someone
I wonder if she’s sorry
for leaving what we’d begun
there’s someone for me somewhere
and I still miss someone

You said goodbye to me this morning
With only these few words to explain
You said you found someone you loved better
But I still hear your voice call my name
    I thought I heard you calling my name
    Funny how it still feels this way
    Your voice seemed so close but I knew
    That by now you were many miles away
I walk through the streets of the city
People passing by think it’s so strange
I’m talking but there’s no on beside me
But I still hear your voice call my name

You said goodbye to me this morning

   I thought I heard you call my name
   Funny how it still feels this way
   Your voice seems so close but I knew
   That by now you were many miles away
I’ll walk through the streets of the city
People passing by think it’s so strange
I’m talking but there’s no one beside me
But I still hear your voice call my name

Well I wanna be a Christian soldier
In the army of our Lord
I’m gonna tell the love of Jesus
Till my life down here is o’er
I’m gonna tell the world he died for me
Tell em how he died in shame
Yes I wanna be a Christian soldier
And fight in my Savior’s name
I love my Savior
He loves me too
I’ll be His soldier
‘Til my life’s work is through
Well I wanna March through the valleys
Then I wanna March up the hill
And I wanna sing about the love of God
And do his blessed will
I wanna drink from the fountain
Be baptised in his love
And I wanna be there when the roll is called
On the home coming day above

I want the lord to protect my soul
Down lifes highway alone I’ve trod
I’ve always put my trust in god
But you’ll find out that you’re silver and gold
Won’t pay the price to protect your soul
I want the lord to protect my soul
To lead me on to heavens door
My life down here will soon be o’er
And I want the lord to protect my soul
There’s many a church down life’s highway
Where people sing rejoice and pray
I’ll stop at one and join the fold
And ask the lord to protect my soul
When this old world is doomed in sin
You’ll cry oh lord please lest me in
It will be to late to make it o’er
To ask the lord to protect your soul

   I want to be kissed but only by your lips dear
   For you’re the only one who’ll ever do
   I want someone to hug and call me honey
   I want to be loved but only by you
I want someone to help me in my sorrow
And someone whose heart is always true
Somebody who will stay with me forever
I want to be loved but only by you
If ever you decide to love me darlin’
And will tell me that your love for me is true
Then we’ll be happy in our home together
I want to be loved but only by you

I wasted my tears when I cried over you
But I should have known you could never be true
Well I loved and I lost you and now I’m so blue
Oh I wasted my tears when I cried over you.
   You said that you loved me and would always be true
   But now you’ve gone and left me oh what will I do?
   Oh why did you leave me for somebody new?
   Oh I wasted my tears when I cried over you.
I wasted my time when I spent it with you
But one is so blind when love is so new
And now all of my fears they all have come true
Oh I wasted my tears when I cried over you.

It’s been many weeks my dear since you told me
That you loved me so dearly and true
But today it seems to me you have changed dear
Are you telling me that our love is through
   When you’re far far away from me darlin’
   If you’re sad and you don’t know what to do
   And you feel that no one cares about you
   I will always be waiting for you
Oh, I can’t forget the day that you told me
That you’d love me and be my sweetheart
But it looks like my dear you’ve forgotten
For you say now that we have to part
All the days seem so lonesome and dreary
And the nights are so lonely and blue
Since you left me alone here without you
Oh, please come back I’m waiting for you

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call forth songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount i’m fixed upon it
Songs of thy redeeming love
I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms
In the arms of my dear Savior
Oh there are ten thousand charms
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood
Here I’ll raise my song in praising
Hither by Thy help I’ve come
And I know by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms
In the arms of my dear Savior
Oh there are ten thousand charms

   I wish you knew how hard I’ve tried to tell you
   How hard I’ve tried to get you off my mind
   I wish you knew how hard I’ve tried to sleep at night
   Since I know that you’re no longer mine
   Since you let another beat my time
If only half the things were true you say about my heart
Then I would have forgotten you since we’ve been apart
You said I forced my lips to kiss you when we said goodbye
You even said I forced the tears that came into my eyes
There’s not a thought that could be worse than knowing that you’re gone
But in the picture in your mind I’m never all alone
You see me in another’s arms just like I’ve been with you
By the way I cry for you each night I only wish you knew

Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
I wonder if they miss me while I roam
I wonder if they pray for the boy who went away
And left his dear old parents all alone
You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
You could see the fields of blue grass where I’ve grown
You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their boy goodbye
Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
Just a village and a homestead on the farm
And a mother’s love to shield you from all harm
A mother’s love so true a sweetheart that loves you
A village and a homestead on the farm

Tonight I’m sad my heart is weary
Wondering if I’m wrong or right
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
   The rain is cold and slowly falling
   Upon my window pane tonight
   And though your love seems even colder
   I wonder where you are tonight
Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you’ve gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight

Your letter came this very day
And it wiped all my dreams away
I’ve read it o’er a thousand times
You left me with a worried mind
    I wonder why you said goodbye
    And did you mean to make me cry
    I guess until the day I die
    That I will still be wondering why.
I dread the thought that we are through
And that you’ve found somebody new
I love you now and always will
I’d rather die than say farewell
I hope and pray before my time
That you’ll come back and say you’re mine
Bring back the love you took away
And mend the heart you broke today

I worship you and the things you do
Still you’re not satisified
I paid the cost I’ve loved and lost
But still I worship you
When we first met and loved we were always side by side
Never then did I think you’d go wrong
But you started goin’ round with the wrong kind of crowd
To my sorrow I’ve found you’ve gone wrong
I go back to our home and I lie awake ’til dawn
Still I can’t get you out of my life
And my friends say next day what a price you must pay
Last night I saw someone with your wife

By and by we’re going to see the king
By and by we’re going to see the king
By and by we’re going to see the king
Well I wouldn’t mind dying if dying was all
Wouldn’t mind dying but I got to go myself
Wouldn’t mind dying but I got to go myself
Wouldn’t mind dying but I got to go myself
Well I wouldn’t mind dying if dying was all
After death we’re going to stand a test
After death we’re going to stand a test
After death we’re going to stand a test
Well I wouldn’t mind dying if dying was all
Ezekiel saw a wheel a wheel in a wheel
Ezekiel saw a wheel a wheel in a wheel
Ezekiel saw a wheel a wheel in a wheel
Well I wouldn’t mind dying if dying was all

If I could be what I’d like to be
I’d like to be a train
Cause trains don’t have no heart to break
And they don’t feel no pain
If love was wine a sweet red wine
I drink away my pain
I’d drink until my heart was filled
With love instead of shame
Why can’t love be like a hickory tree
That stands so strong and tall
Why can’t I find a heart that’s true
Who’ll never say goodbye
Oh what a shame you’ll never change
I guess I always knew
But there’s no girl in the whole wide world
I’d love as much as you

I’d rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than have you say you’re sorry that we are apart
I’d rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than to be in your arms but never in your heart
Well I’ve just received your letter you asked me to come home
You say you’re sorry that you went away
This is an old old story and I’ve heard it all before
So darlin’ this is all that I can say
I tried so hard my darlin’ to make you love me then
‘Cause you would always leave me here alone
And although I could forgive you things would be the same
Nothing could ever change your heart of stone
The Bluegrass Album; California Connection

I’d rather be lonely than be unhappy
I can’t take the life that you lead
Your wild kind of life is not my way of livin’
And I’d rather have it this way
You promised to love me and that’s all that matters
But now you’ve broken those vows
Your night life and bright lights were your kind of choosin’
So I’ll say goodbye to you now

I’ll deck my brow with roses the loved ones may be there
And gems that others gave me will shine within my hair
And even those who know me will think my heart in light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smiles tonight 
   I’ll be all smiles tonight, Love, I’ll be all smiles tonight
   Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smiles tonight 
Oh when the dance commences, Oh how I will rejoice
I’ll sing the songs he taught me without a faulting voice
When the flattering ones come around me they’ll think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smile tonight 
And when the room he entered with a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him as though he was a charm
And once he smiled upon her as once he’d smiled at me
They knew not what I suffered, they found no change in me 
And when the dance is over and all have gone to rest
I’ll think of him, dear Mother, the one that I love best
He once did love me dearly and ne’er from me would part
He sought not to deceive me, false friends have changed his heart

I may be a little bit tight tonight
But I’ll be alright tomorrow
Be alright tomorrow, be alright tomorrow
I may be a a little bit tight tonight
But I’ll be alright tomorrow
Cause my baby’s coming home
Ever since she left me
Things ain’t been right
I’ve been out drinking every night
I got a letter just today
She’s coming home to stay
Said she’d never leave my arms again

I was standing by the bedside of a neighbor
Who was just about to cross the swelling tide
I asked if she would do me a favor
Just take a message to the other side
If you see my savior tell Him that you saw me
When you saw me I was on my way
You may meet some old friends who may ask about me
Just tell them I’ll be home some day
Now you’ll have to take this journey on without me
It’s a debt that soon or later must be paid
If you see my savior don’t forget to tell Him
Don’t forget to tell him what I say
You may chance to see my father or my mother
Or some friends who have gone before
You may chance to see my sister or my brother
But try to see my savior first of all

When my soul is singing in that promised land above
I’ll be satisfied
Praising Christ the Savior for redeeming grace and love
I’ll be satisfied
I’ll be satisfied ( satisfied )
I’ll be satisfied ( satisfied )
When my soul is resting in the presence of the Lord
I’ll be satisfied
Living in a city where the soul shall never die
I’ll be satisfied
There to meet with loved ones never more to say good-bye
I’ll be satisfied
When I meet the ransomed over on the golden shore
I’ll be satisfied
There I’ll join the angels singing praises ever more
I’ll be satisfied

Slowly the long day turns to night
Soon they’ll switch off the prison lights
And in my cell I’m making plans
To be at home with you again
   These walls and bars can’t hold a dreaming man
   So I’ll be home to tuck the babies in
   They can chain my body but not my mind
   So I’ll break out again tonight
The warden thinks I’m in for life
All he’s ever seen me wear is stripes
He don’t know about my blue suit and my tie
That I wear when I’m with you at night

Tonight as I write you I pray you will find
You’re driving me crazy plum out of my mind
If you’ll come back darling I’ll treat you so kind
I’ll buy you fine clothes and I’ll drink no more wine
   I’m waiting I’m waiting for you to return
   The longer I wait the more my heart burns
   If you’ll come home darling I’ll treat you so kind
   I’ll never mistreat you I’ll drink no more wine
It’s been one year darling since you told me goodbye
And the pillow stays wet with tears from my eyes
If you’ll come back darling I’ll treat you so kind
I love you I love you I’ll drink no more wine
The day that you left me I thought it was grand
I was a happy-go-lucky man
But tonight dear it’s different as I write these lines
My happiness has folded, luck’s left me behind

I’ll find another woman go find you another man
One that you can show that you’re the leader of the band
Perhaps you’ll love the only life you’ll ever understand
I’ll find another woman go find you another man
You said that you’re not happy with a baby on your knee
So you leave it all alone and go stepping out on me
Well every night you’re on your way to that wild side of life
You can’t stand the thought to be a mother or a wife
It seems you don’t care about the kind of life you choose
You know that if you ramble some day you’re gonna lose
This big world around you will tumble in your hand
I’ll have me another woman
you’ll need another man
Down this highway of sorrow I’ll leave to you alone
For I know you’ll always feel that same old tumbling stone
Another man will see you and than he’ll stumble on
He’ll be a victum of a woman that’s gone away
*Refrain

Some bright morning when this life is over
I’ll fly away
To that home on God’s celestial shore
I’ll fly away 
   I’ll fly away oh glory
   I’ll fly away (in the morning)
   When I die hallelujah by and by
   I’ll fly away 
When the shadows of this life have gone
I’ll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls I’ll fly
I’ll fly away 
Oh how glad and happy when we meet
I’ll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet
I’ll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
I’ll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I’ll fly away

Don’t feel blue when I tell you I’m leavin
Please don’t cry now when I set you free
Though I know that my heart will be breakin
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
   When that cold rain is fallin outside dear
   And you’re happy far over the sea
   Don’t be thinkin of me in my sorrow
   I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
No don’t shed any tears they’d be wasted
Our love it was never meant to be
That’s why I don’t want you to worry
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
I knew all the time you weren’t happy
That someday I’d have to set you free
So forget about me and my troubles
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me

Don’t think I’ll be hanging around while you’re having fun
I won’t sit here crying over you
From now on when you step out I’ll tell you what I’ll do
I’ll lock the door, put out the cat and I’ll go stepping too
   Yes, I’ll go stepping too, my honey
   I’ll go stepping too
   I’ll lock the door, put out the cat
   And I’ll go stepping too
Now every time you come in late we begin to fight
You tell me there are more fish in the sea
But the bait ain’t what it used to be and I’ve got news for you
Now after this when you step out then I’ll go stepping too
From now on when you come in and you won’t tell where you been
With your hair mussed up and your clothes don’t fit you right
Don’t start to yell if you find I look the same way too
Then you will know that I have been stepping just like you

You spurned the love I gave you darling
A love you once was proud to own
Your found someone who you love better
And in my dreams I walk alone
   I’ll just pretend that I don’t love you
   I’ll just pretend that I don’t care
   And when I meet you face to face dear
   I’ll turn my head I’ll just pretend
Those happy hours we spent together
Forever in my heart will live
That’s all I have for each tomorrow
For we will never meet again
I’ll try my best to forget you
To love you now is such a sin
And as I’m facing all my fears, dear
They’ll understand I won’t pretend

    Go and leave me if you wish to
    ANd I hope you’re satisfied
    When I my heart starts a breakin’
    I’ll just take this train and ride
Standin by this lonesome railroad
Thinking of the days gone by
How you left me little darlin
And I hung my head and cried
This very spot that I’m now standing
I once held you as my own
But the whine of that old freight train
Broke apart our happy home

   I’ll never love anybody but you, baby, baby
   I’ll never love anybody but you if you’ll be my girl
   Oh yes believe me it’s true
   Oh yes, I’ll love nobody but you
I’ll always be true to you, baby, baby
I’ll always be true to you if you’ll be my girl
Oh yes believe me it’s true
Oh yes, I’ll love nobody but you
I’ll take you out every night, baby, baby
I’ll take you out if you’ll be my girl
Oh yes believe me it’s true
Oh yes, I’ll love nobody but you

Now tonight as I write this note to you
There’s sorrow in my heart
I hate to say goodbye my dear
But it’s better that we part
   Don’t think that I’ve grown tired of you
   Or found somebody new
   For you were all I’ve ever had
   And I love no one but you
Now when your read this note my dear
I hope you’ll understand
And think of the one that loves you best
This broken hearted man
Now that I have loved and lost
I hope your satisfied
It’ll be so hard to go through this world
With a broken heart inside

Though a roamer in life I’ve rambled
For riches my life’s been denied
But in love I find wealth flowing freely
With its help I’ll keep troubles in stride
Love knows no boundaries or pathways
It has no clinging or ties
Too precious to live here without it
I’ll love you ’til the day I die
Though the trials and troubles are many
At times I stand woefully bent
Still I long for each moment of living
My heart poureth o’er ’til the end

On Sunday when the church bells start ringin’
They’re ringin’ for you and for me
Let’s all gather ’round at the altar
And pray that our souls may be free
I’ll meet you in the church Sunday mornin’
And we’ll all kneel down and pray
We’ll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way
It’s a place where we all meet on Sunday
To worship our Lord up above
And let all our sins be forgiven
And meet with our loved ones above
In heaven I hear a voice callin’
From the land where there’s no endless days
Let’s all be prepared to meet Jesus
the path is narrow too at home far away

I’ll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
I’ll be standin’ at the portals when the gates open wide
At the close of life’s long weary day
I’ll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
And we’ll sit down by the river and when all the rapture is renewed
You’ll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning In the city that is built four square
I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
In that land when life’s sun goeth down

I am so happy that you love no other but me
All of my life I’ve tried to win your love you see
And I still wonder if you will be happy with me
When we are married and I’ve taken you my wife to be
I have waited so long for the words you just said
I always thought that you loved another instead
But you have told me with your own sweet lips so red
And I am waiting for the day when we shall wed
If you should ever forsake me my love I would pray
Take me my maker up in heaven where white angels stay
Cause I could never go on living without you this way
If we are to part I’d rather you take me today
No no I’ll never forsake you I’ll always be true
And we’ll be happy together because I love you
And when I think of us parting sweetheart it runs through my head
If we cant be happy together my love I would rather be dead

It’s been a long time since you drifted away
Now there’s nothin’ to live for it seems
But darlin’ no matter where you are tonight
You’ll be here with me inmy dreams
I ‘ll nevergrow tired of you sweetheart
No mat-ter what you may do
They tell me lately you’re livin’ so wrong
But I’ll never grow tired of you
I see your two blue eyes each night in my dreams
But when I awake you’re not thee
Come back to me and let’s start life anew
Losin’ you’s so hard to bare
I still wonder why you’ve drifted away
From the happiness that may have been
I can vision the time you’d someday be mine
Cherish the love I can’t win

I’ll never love another now that you’ve gone away
And left me here to grieve dear all alone
It seems I always lose my dear no matter how I try
I’ll never love another, ‘til the day I die
   I’ll never love another now that you’ve proved untrue
   Without your loving darling, what am I to do
   I’ve spent my life for you dear now you’ve left me blue
   I’ll never love another if I can’t have you
Our castle now has tumbled down that I had built for you
And all my dreams have vanished dear with you
I’ll find no one to take you place so I’ll not even try
I’ll never love another, ‘til the day I die
Now you don’t even know the heartache that you caused me to bear
Or you would never stole my love from me
I’ll have to live my life alone and think of days gone by
I’ll never love another, ‘til the day I die

Since you went away the skies have turned to gray
I nev-er knew I loved you this way
I can’t live without you and if you come back soon
Darlin’ I’ll never make you blue
I’ll nev-er make you blue darlin’ I’ll promise you
To be forever honest and true
The things I used to do I’ll quit them all for you
Darlin’ I’ll never make you blue
Darl-in’ I’m to blame but I won’t be the same
All I ask is one more chance
To prove what I can do dar-lin’ for you
I’ll prove that I can make your heart be true
Please come back to me don’t leave me here to grieve
My life will wait for your memory
Just let me alone and say you’ll come back home
Darlin’ I can’t live alone

How many times have I seen you with a tear upon your check
And that beautiful attempt at a smile
You wave good-bye and wish me well and don’t forget to write
Once again I have you counting the miles
The pained expression in your face
The frailty of your form
As you slowly faded from my sight
It’s a picture in my memory I never will forget
Though I haven’t seen your face in a while
Always looking toward the next horizon
Never looking back on where I’ve been
Tomorrow is another day you know that I’ll be back someday
I guess that’s just the way the story ends
For I find myself alone without a friend
You know for every fond farewell there always was hello
And I hoped that it would help to ease your pain
And now I stand in these new shoes
the tears are rollin’ down
For I know I’ll never see your face again

I used to sit alone at night and worry little darling
For I thought you meant the world to me
But now things have changed and those days are gone forever
So I’ll never shed another tear
   I’ll never shed another tear now I don’t care what happens
   You have proved your love untrue to me
   There’s nothing you can do that will ever change my feelings
   So I’ll never shed another tear
With a broken heart I’ll never forget the vows we made together
The many times you told me not to fear
But now you’ve forgotten and you’ve left me here forever
So I’ll never shed another tear
Now you should have told me dear that you were only fooling
Then I’d never learn to love you so
Then I wouldn’t have all these heartaches my darling
Dreading the day I see you go

I’ll not be a stranger when I get to that city
I’m acquainted with folks over there
There’ll be friends there to greet me
There’ll be loved ones to meet me
At the gates of that city four square
   
    Through the years, through the tears, they’ve gone one by one
    But they’ll wait at the gate until my race is run
    I’ll not be a stranger when I get to that city
    I’m acquainted with folks over there
I’ll not be a stranger when I get to that city
I’ve a home on the streets paved with gold
I’ll feel right at home there
In that beautiful somewhere
With the loved ones whose memory I hold
I’ll not be a stranger when I get to that city
There’ll be no lonely days over there
There’ll be no stormy weather
But a great time together
On the streets of that city four square

When the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars
And the beautiful moon sweeps the sky
When the dew drops of heaven are kissing the rose
It is then that my memory flies
Upon the wings of some beautiful dove
To hasten the message of cheer
I’ll send you a kiss of affection and say
I’ll remember you, Love, in my prayers
When the angels of heaven are guarding the good
As God has ordained them to do
In answer to prayers that I offered to Him
I know there’s one waiting for you
Go where you will on land or on sea
I’ll share all your sorrows and cares
And at night when I kneel by my bedside to pray
I’ll remember you, Love, in my prayers
May the angels be with you and guard you through life
And guide you up Heaven’s bright stairs
And know that I love you wherever you roam
I’ll remember you, Love, in my prayers

Now you just told me that you’re leaving
On the next train coming down
I love you dear but I won’t follow
I just think I’ll stay around
   For I know someday you’ll want me
   When your true love can’t be found
   But if you go dear I won’t follow
   I just think I’ll stay around
You know my dear I’ll always love you
And I’d never let you down
But if you go dear I won’t follow
I just think I’ll stay around
Someday you’ll hear that whistle blowing
On the special coming down
You’ll be looking for me baby
But I may not be around

I’ve slipped around, dear, two-timing you
Having fun now, like some guys do
But now I’m sorry and now I’m true
Forgive me, darling, its up to you
   Well I don’t blame you if you two-time, too
   Because I’m guilty for the things I do
   I’ve slipped around, love, played every game
   And if you leave me I’ll take the blame
I ain’t got much money, I’m just a pauper guy
Trying to go on, dear without your love, I’ll die
So please don’t leave me, whatever you do
Just squeeze me, darling, while I’m loving you

I’m gonna sit down and rest gently lean on His breast
I’ll talk it all over with Him
I’ll see my mother and dad truest friends I ever had
I’ll talk it all over with Him
   I’m gonna sit I’m gonna stand up gonna walk all around
   I’ll talk it all over with Him
   I’ll meet old’ Peter and Paul but the best of it all
   I’ll talk it all over with Him
Up in that land of sweet rest with the good and the blessed
I’ll talk it all over with Him
And by my Savior’s dear side I will ever abide
I’ll talk it all over with Him
So many things in this land I shall ne’er understand
I’ll talk it all over with Him
I’ll still be true to my Lord as we live in accord
I’ll talk it all over with Him

I once had a sweetheart to love me
But now she has proven untrue
She’s found a new love to treasure
That’s why I’m walking round blue
The lies you told me are over
The heart you broke is gone
And friends they tell me I’m lucky
I’m better off now that you’re gone
You broke my heart when you loved me
I’ve always counted on you
But now you’ve strayed with another
LIttle girl what more could I do
Some day I know you’ll be sorry
You led my poor heart astray
You seemed to think it was funny
But some say darling you’ll pay
I’m better off now that you’re gone

The lonesome sigh of a train going by
Makes me want to stop and cry
I recall the day it took you away
I’m blue I’m lonesome too
   When I hear that whistle blow
   I want to pack my suitcase and go
   The lonesome sound of a train going by
   Makes me want to stop and cry
In the still of the night in the pale moonlight
The wind, it moans and cry
These lonesome blues I just can’t lose
I’m blue I’m lonesome too

   I’m going down this lonesome road
   To see my fate or victory
   God must help us there to win
   I’m coming back but I don’t know when
I hate to leave my mother dear
My father who is old and gray
But my true love I know you’ll wait
For me to come back to me to stay
Will you be here when I come home
Or will your love fade like a rose
I could never come back should you be gone
My love for you nobody knows

I’m going across the sea stay forever more
Left my little darlin’ standing in the door
Won’t you come and go come and go with me
Fly to me my pretty little Miss I’m going across the sea
Wind is howling low wind is howling high
Go with me my pretty little love ’til the day I die.
Won’t you come and go come and go with me
Fly to me my pretty little Miss I’m going across the sea.
Wouldn’t you give a nickel wouldn’t you give a dime
Wouldn’t you give one dollar bill to call your name as mine?
Won’t you come and go come and go with me
Fly to me my pretty little Miss I’m going across the sea.
Donie Donie Donie what makes your face so red
Working out in the crops son fever in my head
Won’t you come and go come and go with me
Fly to me my pretty little Miss I’m going across the sea.

   I’m going back to old Kentucky
   There to see my Linda Lou
   I’m going back to old Kentucky
   Where the skies are always blue
When my left old Kentucky
Linda kissed me and she cried
I told her that I would not linger
I’d be back by and by
Linda Lou is she is a beauty
Those pretty brown eyes I loved so well
I’m going back to old Kentucky
Never more to say farewell
Linda Lou you know I love you
I long for you each night and day
When the roses bloom in old Kentucky
I’ll be coming back to stay

I left my old home in the mountains
And the only friends I ever had
And while I rambled this world over
My heart felt so lonely and sad
   I’m going back to the old home
   Back to the place I love so well
   Where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
   Back to the old home on the hill
I know that dear old mother’s waiting
Waiting alone on that hill
With the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
In the old cabin home on the hill
Years have gone by since I saw her
I’ve traveled many a mile
But tonight there’s a light in the window
And she’s waiting at the door with a smile

For six long years I’ve been here in this prison
livin my life behind bars in this dirty cell
tomorrow they’re goin to take me down to nashville
and send my soul to heaven or to hell
 But I’m goin to love you like there’s no tomorrow
I’m gonna love you like there’s no yesterday
I’m gonna hug and kiss away your sorrow
I’m gonna love you like there’s no tomorrow
the warden said my last request was granted
you could come and stay with me tonight
you’re the only one who ever really loved me
so hold me in your arms hold me tight
i know that my life will soon be over
and the life of our baby child is just begun
there’s only one thought thats left to haunt me
just to think that what i’ve lost i might have won

    I’m gonna love you one more time
    And give you a chance to be true
    If you leave me again we’ll no longer be friends
    For I’m tired of playing hide and seek with you
Oh I just read the letter you wrote me
And these tear stains you cannot deny
I can see that you’re tired of your new love
I will answer in just a few lines
After searching this wild world all over
I’m surprised to have found you again
I had made up my mind to forget you
But my heart was too broken to mend
Once you’ve been in the arms of another
But now you are trying to flee
From the cold empty world he left you
Now you’re ready to come back to me

I just found out today the little game you play
I’ve been sleeping all my life away
You’ve been stepping so they say between midnight and day
So I’m gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
 From now on (from now on) all night long (all night long)
You won’t have a chance to treat your daddy wrong
You’ve been stepping so they say between midnight and day
So I’m gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
There’s honky tonk down the road just a mile or so
I understand that’s where you spend your time
Baby I got news for you your little game is through
From now on baby you’re gonna toe the line
You thought you were being wise running around with other guys
And leaving me to spend my time alone
But you’ll find out today it don’t work out that way
You started a little game that two can play

I don’t pick up the mail I don’t pick up the phone
I don’t answer the door I just ‘ soon be alone
I don’t keep this place up I just keep the lights out
I don’t live in this room I just rattle around
I’m just a ghost in this house I’m just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I hold this home I’m just a whisper of smoke
I’m all that’s left of two hearts on fire That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul I’m just a ghost in this house
I don’t care if it rains I don’t care if it’s clear
I don’t mind staying in there’s another ghost here
He sits down in your chair and he shines with your light
And he lays down his head on your pillow at night

When we were young and loved each other
More than anyone will know
Until that day you found a new love
Then you said I’d have to go.
    Oh the Road is rough and rocky
   Since the day I last saw you
   Another’s won your heart forever
   And I’m lonesome without you.
On down this lonesome road I wander
There’s nothing left for me to do
For I’ve still got this memory of you
And the love that we once knew.
My hope is now that you’ll be happy
With the new love that you’ve found
But should you ever change your mind dear
Remember me I’ll be around.

   Lonesome, lonesome, pining away
   Now you say its best to part
   Even though it breaks my heart
   I’m lost and I’ll never find the way
Since you said we must part darling you have broke my heart
I am drifting like a ship lost at sea
In a world of despair its so lonesome there
Why don’t you come back to me
You said you’d be true no one else would ever do
I believed you with all my heart and soul
But you broke every vow and its all over now
I’m left in this world lone and cold

Back in the days of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills
     I’m on my way back to the old home
    The road winds on up the hill
    But there’s no light in the window
    That shined long ago where I live
Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mother were called to heaven
I’s left in this world all alone
High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot in my memory
I’m on my way back to the old home
The light in the window I long to see

When Louisville was eight more miles away my old heart sung a song
Well I thought I’d hug kiss my gal before so very long
But when I got to Louisville I found she wasn’t true
So I’ll tell you all about it now that’s why I feel so blue
When I got to Louisville my gal she wasn’t there
They sais she’d gone with someone else it was more than I could bear
So I’m heading out of this old town where to I don’t much care
Louisville is eight miles back and I’m on my way somewhere
I always dreamed of some sweet day when she could be my wife
And we would settle down somewhere and lead a happy life
But now I know just how things are and how they’d always be
So I know now Louisville just ain’t the place for me
Right now I’m traveling down this road to get her off my mind
The thing I want to do is leave old Louisville behind
Who knows I may find happiness and one who fills the bill
A girl that’s true and not like her that lives in Louisville

I’m only human you see but you told me goodbye
I’ll keep the tears in my heart yes I’ll try and I’ll try
I’ve shared your sorrow and joys now I know it’s goodbye
I’m only human but I’ll try not to cry
    I was happy with you by my side
    Though my life I kept shadowed with pride
    You asked if I’d be your true love and I said til I die
    Now you tell me a new love you’ve found

I wish I was in the Southland sitting in a chair
With one arm around my old guitar
And the other one around my dear
   I’m rolling on (I’m rolling on)
   I’m rolling on (I’m rolling on)
   I’m rolling on through life just rolling on
Sitting in the moonlight blue as blue can be
Strumming on my old guitar
To give my poor heart ease
Whether I’m in the country whether I’m in the town
My old guitar is near me
Whether I’m up or down
Maybe I will marry if I can find a girl
But I’ll always love my guitar
As much as I love her

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I’m so lonesome I could cry
I’ve never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That mean’s he’s lost his will to live
I’m so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I’m so lonesome I could cry

I didn’t know
You’d be in this place tonight
Then again I thought you might
Now I don’t know what to do 
Does it show
When my poor heart skips a beat
Each and every time we meet
‘Cause I’m still in love with you 
There you are
Right across the room from me
Just the way I knew you’d be
Lookin’ lonesome wild and blue 
I’m alright so far
Just as long as you don’t speak
That’s what makes my knees go weak
‘Cause I’m still in love with you 
    I’ve done everything I know
    To get you off my mind
    But sometimes I can’t help but hope
    That you won’t walk away this time 
Then I
Wouldn’t have to watch you go
Wouldn’t have to miss you so
‘Cause I’m still in love with you 
If I knew what I know now
I’d never let you leave
I’d make it up to you somehow
And darlin’ you’d come back to me

When I say front I want you hop
When I start talking then I want you to stop
Cause Baby (I’m a telling you baby)
I’m the boss of this here house
When I want a kiss give me all you got
Don’t give ‘em to me cold, give ‘em to me hot
Cause Baby (I’m a telling you baby)
I’m the boss of this here house
   Now hun you learn you can only speak
   when you’ve been spoken to
   I’m telling you now, I’ll let you know
   when I want to hear from you
When I say rooster, you can’t crow
When I say get, you better go
Cause Baby (I’m a telling you baby)
I’m the boss of this here house

I’m thinking about you and hoping you’re true
There long weary nights I’m going thru
I’m never glad I’m always sad
Darling you know I’m thinking about you
Darling you know what we’ve been thru
Darling you know we can’t be untrue
I’m doing my part I’m trusting your heart
Sweetheart you know I’m thinking about you
When you were a little girl and I a little boy
We promised our love to share and enjoy
But the time has come when I’m far away
Thinking about you both night and day
I’ll say my love you must do the same
To make all our dreams we promise come true
I’m doing my part I’m trusting your heart
Darling you know I’m thinking about you
* Refrain

‘Twould been better for us both had we never
In this wide and wicked world had never met,
But the pleasure we both seemed to gather
I’m sure, love, I’ll never forget
   Oh, I’m thinking tonight of my blue eyes
   Who is sailing far over the sea
   I’m thinking tonight of my blue eyes
   And I wonder if he ever thinks of me
Oh, you told me once, dear, that you loved me;
You vowed that we never would part
But a link in the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad and aching heart
When the cold, cold grave shall enclose me
Will you come near and shed just one tear?
Will you say to the strangers around you
A poor heart you have broken lies here?

Oh I was lost in the darkness and I wandered astray
With no one to help me see along on my way
Until I heard Jesus calling saying
Come unto me and I’m traveling on and on
Oh Lord I’m traveling on by my Savior
And I can never stray for Jesus leads the way
And I’ll get off the wagon at the end of my journey
Oh Lord I’m traveling on and on
Oh I can hear Jesus calling and His voice sounds so sweet
And I know that the time had come to kneel at His feet
But my troubles are over for He bid me come home
And I’m traveling on and on
Oh the on Lord is my Savior and my hope it will stay
He will help me and protect me to the end of the way
My journey will soon be over and I’ll join the happy band
And I’m traveling on and on

   I’m troubled I’m troubled
   I’m troubled in mind
   If trouble don’t kill me
   I’ll live a long time
Now meeting is pleasure and parting is grief
And a false-hearted lover is worse than a thief
A thief can but rob you and take what you’ve saved
But a false-hearted lover’ll take you to your grave
The grave will detain you and turn you to dust
Ain’t a girl in a million a poor boy can trust
They’ll hug you, they’ll kiss you they’ll tell you more lies
Then the cross ties on a railroad or the stars in the skies
I’m going to Georgia I’m going to roam
I’m going to Georgia gonna make it my home
Gonna build me a cabin in the mountains so high
Where the wild birds and the turtle doves can’t hear my sad cry

I’m waiting at the gate looking for my ride
Soon to take me to my home on high
Angel bands a coming From the other side
I don’t want to be late I’m waiting at the gate
   I can hear the thunder the time’s at hand
   Joybells are ringing in the promised land
   Jesus is a coming my soul to take
   Yes my Lord sees me waiting at the gate
I’m a’ leaving the world no more to do
All of my work on earth is through
I’ve fought the fight I’ve kept the faith
Well I’m ready to go I’m waiting at the gate

I’m beggin’ to you and I want to go with you
You’re breakin’ my heart as you say goodbye
I hope and I pray we’ll soon be together
My heart is so full it’s hard not to cry
What will I do when the leaves start fallin’
The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Soon the flowers will die don’t let love die with them
And with you gone dear what will I do
Your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
And your mournful eyes they keep haunting me
But to know that you’re mine it makes life worth livin’
Oh the times gone by are sweet memories
I’m trusting in you but each hour seems longer
I’m counting the days when I’ll be with you
Our hearts are entwined they’re blessed with the future
A safe journey home I’m waiting for you

   I’m waiting to hear you call me darling
   I’m waiting to hear you call me dear
   You know that I have always loved you
   Don’t make me lonely all these years
Two years ago when I first met you
You smiled at me and looked so sweet
You made me think you cared about me
But you never said that you loved me
Oh maybe I took too much for granted
To think you’d ever love me
Please oh please don’t try to fool me
‘Cause all you’d cause is misery

   I’m a working on building
   I’m a working on building
   I’m a working on building
   For my lord for my lord
   
   It’s a holy ghost building
   It’s a holy ghost building
   It’s a holy ghost building
   For my lord for my lord
If I was a liar I tell you what I would do
I’d quit my lying and work on a building too
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I’d quit my drinking and work on a building too
If I was a gambler I tell you what I would do
I’d quit my gambling and work on a building too
If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching and work on a building too

The things dear that I say they don’t mean much anyway
Cause I’m a rambler dear thats how it’s got to stay
I tried dear to be true but I told them lies on you
And for those lies I’ll forever have to pay
    Oh I tried to make love happen
    Didn’t mean to shut you down
    For I’ve always been a rambler
    It’s for rambling that I’m bound
When the train comes down the track and it’s bringing my baby back
Hear the rails rumbling through the town
Well I’ll be on that train reapin heartache and pain
And yours is the heart that I’m after now

   Hang me, oh, hang me and I’ll be dead and gone
   Hang me, oh, hang me and I’ll be dead and gone
   I wouldn’t mind the hanging Lord it’s laying in jail so long boys
   I’ve been all around this world
Working on the new railroad, mud up to my knees
Working on the new railroad, mud up to my knees
Working for John Henry, and he’s mighty hard to please
Been all around this world
Went up on the mountain, there I took my stand
Went up on the mountain, there I took my stand
Rifle on my shoulder, six shooter in my hand
Been all around this world
Lulu, oh Lulu, come and open that door
Lulu, oh Lulu, come and open that door
Before I have to open it with my old forty-four
Been all around this world
Mama and papa and baby sister makes three
Mama and papa and baby sister makes three
Take me down to the gallows boys that’s the last they’ll see of me
Been all around this world
Now if you meet a rich girl, boys, send her down the line
Now if you meet a rich girl, boys, send her down the line
If you meet a poor girl, bet she’s a friend of mine
Been all around this world

Born in the mountains fifty years ago
I’ve trod the hills and valleys through the rain and snow
I’ve seen the lightning flashing I’ve heard the thunder roll
I’ve Endured I’ve Endured how long can one endure
Barefoot in the summer on into the fail
Too many mouths to feed they couldn’t clothe us all
Sent to church on Sunday to learn the golden rule
I’ve Endured I’ve Endured how long can one endured
I’ve worked for the rich I’ve lived with the poor
I’ve see many a heartache there’ll be many a more
Lived loved and sorrowed been to success’s door
I’ve Endured I’ve Endured how long can one endured
Del McCoury; And The Dixie Pals Live In Japan

High on that lonesome road to heaven’s blessed abode
For many years I was burdened with care
So often lightening flashed and raging billows dashed
My sorrow then was so heavy to bear
But since my Jesus came I praise his holy name
He sheds the light of his wonderful grace
And every night and day to him I steal away
I found a blessed hiding place
   I found a hiding place a blessed hiding place
   I said a hiding a blessed hiding place
   There’s glory in my soul my hallelujah rolls
   But since my Jesus came I’m under his control
   He keeps me night and day He answers when I pray
   And from the raging storm to Him I steal away
   I hear those temptors knock I feel no temply shock
   Oh in the solid rock I found a hinding place
Just like a wandering Jew that had no place to choose
Each day I had to keep travelin’ on
But now I’ve found the way that leads to endless days
No more in darkness I wander alone
When Satan would alarm I climb in God’s strong arm
And hide away in his loving embrace
For in the solid rock the blessed solid rock
I found a blessed hidin’ place

I’ve got a bulldog he cost five hundred
I’ve got a bulldog he cost five hundred
I’ve got a bulldog he cost five hundred
In my back yard babe in my back yard
When he barks he roars like thunder
When he barks he roars like thunder
When he barks he roars like thunder
Bite you baby gonna bite you bad
Take this hammer and give it to the captain
Take this hammer and give it to the captain
Take this hammer and give it to the captain
Tell him I’m gone babe tell him I’m gone
When you pass by oh say good morning
When you pass by oh say good morning
When you pass by oh say good morning
But I’ll be gone like a turkey through the corn
When you see my long haired buddy
When you see my long haired buddy
When you see my long haired buddy
Tell him I’m gone babe tell him I’m gone

I’ve got bluegrass on my mind heading back to old Kentucky
Where the mountains look so pretty in the spring
When the dew is on the bluegrass sparkling with the sun’s good morning
I’ve got good old bluegrass on my mind again
Let me hear the fox hounds running High at night among the mountains
And then later when the fox horn blows them in
Let me hear the roosters crowing Smell the ham and bacon frying
I’ve got good old bluegrass on my mind again
In a little cabin home where your neighbor was your neighbor
And the bluegrass started growing every spring
There we danced on Saturday night to fiddle and a banjo
I’ve got old bluegrass on my mind again

No matter what I say or do
I just can’t seem to get inside your heart
What have I done wrong
Lately you’re so far away
You just don’t seem to hold me like you use to
Somethin’s goin’ on
   I’ve got that ol’ feelin’ you’re leavin’
   I’m so tired of good-bye
   I can’t wait on your love forever
   While you change your mind
Mornin’ finds us face to face
I feel you starin’ through me while I’m talkin’
What’s come over you
Familiar looks I recognize
The same ol’ looks that said good-bye the last time
Somethin’ I’m use to

Oh, I was standing by the bedside
Where my fevered mother lay
When she called me close beside her
And I thought I heard her say
   
   I’ve just seen the rock of ages
   Jacob’s ladder hanging down
   I’ve just crossed the river of Jordan
   Now, my son, I’m homeward bound
Oh, as we gathered by her bedside
Tears begin to fill our eyes
Then she called me close beside her
And whispered softly her good-byes
Pine trees blowing cross the mountain
Where forever she will lay
There she’ll rest beside the fountain
There she’ll sleep beneath the clay

Friends tell me that told you wed another
They say you look so happy all the time
I just can’t realize that I have lost you
Somehow I thought you always would be mine
I’ve love you since the day that I first met you
I thought no one could ever come between
Those promises you made have all been broken
And all I have to live for now is grief
Somehow I can’t believe that you’ll be happy
With memories to haunt you night and day
But only time can make you learn your lesson
I’m sure you think you’ve reached your goal today
I never thought someday that I would lose you
You’re just the kind that never could be true
You only wanted me just for a while dear
Just long enough to break my heart in two

And each lonely night I still wait for you
At the same old Place like I used to do
I know it’s no use I’ve Lost you forever
You can’t conceal a heart that is broken
And a love like mine will never die
I can’t explain how I felt when you left me
All I know is I wanted to die

Everything I ever loved is gone I lost my wife I lost my home
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
The moon has even lost it’s glow the sun don’t shine anymore
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
   Since you’ve gone I’ve cried to myself
   Told my heart there’s nothing left
   I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
   I’ve walked the floor the streets of town
   Guess I’ll never live it down
   I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
I heard that lonesome whistle blow seen lonesome midnights come and go
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
Seen days I thought would never end when only blues come creeping in
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
My love for her will linger on even though she’s done me wrong
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life
So I’ll just live my life alone maybe some day she’ll come home
I’ve never been so lonesome in my life

As I sat down to a gambling game I could hardly play my hand
For thinking about that woman I love run away with another man
Run away with another man poor boy run away with another man
I’m thinking about that woman I love run away with another man
I bought her everything she needs I dressed her up so fine
She caused me to work for forty years I’ve still got ninety nine
I’ve still got ninety nine poor boy I’ve still got ninety nine
She caused me to work for forty years I’ve still got ninety nine
I stroll down to the old depot just to watch the train roll by
I looked in the window saw the woman I loved hung down my head and cried
Hung down my head and cried poor boy hung down my head and cried
I looked in the window saw the woman I loved hung down my head and cried
They took me down to the old jailhouse the door they slammed on me
Said if you’ll report that moonshine still I’ll see that you got free
I’ll see that you go free poor boy I’ll see that you go free
If you’ll report that moonshine still I’ll see that you go free
I told my age was twenty one the truth I told that time
Before I’ll report that moonshine still I’ll go and serve my time
I’ll go and serve my time poor boy I’ll go and serve my time
Before I’ll report that moonshine still I’ll go and serve my time

I’ve waited for you and I’ve always been true
But this waiting no longer I can stand
I know you’ve had time dear to make up your mind
I’ve waited as long as I can
   I’m waiting to hear you say you love me
   And long for the day you take my hand
   I asked again last night for your love so divine
   I’ve waited as long as I can
Done all I can do said all I can say
Oh why can’t I make you understand
I wanted you for mine but I’m wasting my time
I’ve waited as long as I can
Now I’ll just say goodbye the tears fall from my eyes
For you have made it plain that I can’t win
No one will ever know the pain that I’ve been through
I’ve waited as long as I can

    Love me now while I’m livin
    Please don’t wait until I’m gone
    And then chisel it in marble
    Warm love words on an ice cold stone
If you have these thoughts about me
Why not tell them to me now
Don’t you know they’d make me happy
Whisper them as you kiss my brow
If you wait until I’m sleepin
Never to wake here again
There’ll be walls of earth between us
And I could not hear you then
So my dear if you love me
If only just a little bit
Let me know now while I’m living
So I can hold and treasure it

If blue is the colour of lonesome
Then paint me a deep shade of blue
Blue’s the way that I’m feelin’
Blue because I lost you 
 eems there’s been changes in colour
But not a great change in me
If blue is the colour of lonesome
Then blue is the colour for me 
Red is the colour of the flaming love
But the flame has gone cold
You went with another and left me
Left me to cry all alone

How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what repture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
So happy I would be twould mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again
She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love I seek that home above
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day
Within the old home place her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear
My work on earth is done the life crown has been won
And she will be at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and love

   If I could only go back home again
   To see the hills and feel the wind
   I’d walk the road to where it all began
   And find the man I lost back home again.
It’s been awhile since I’ve been home
I miss the place I come from and the smell of the old wood smoke
I close my eyes I can see all of my favorite memories
How I wish I could go back home again.
The lamp is dim time moves slow
The night owl sings a song I know the darkness seems an old familiar friend
The falling rain and gentle winds rock my soul to sleep again
A quiet place this peaceful dream of home.

If I could only win your love
I’d make he most of everything
I’d proudly wear your wedding ring
My heart would never stray one dream away 
   Oh how can I ever say
   How I crave your love when you’re gone away
   Oh how can I ever show
   How I burn inside when you hold me tight 
 If I could only win your love
I’d give my all to make it live
You’ll never know how much I’d give
If I could only win your love 
 If I could only win your love
I’d give my all tomake it live
You’ll never know how much I’d give
If I could only win your love.

Well I packed up my old clothes and drove on down the road
Four hunderd miles or more until I reached my next show.
The wind was blowing cold and brother don’t you know
This pain inside my heart just won’t let go.
I never was one to follow a straight and narrow path
But I would now if it would lead me to my past.
Back to her loving arms is where I want to go
To the one who left me out in the cold.
   If I could turn back the hands of time
   To the day when she was mine
   If she’d take me back right now
   I would walk the line
   If I could turn back the hands of time.
She never wanted me to leave her all alone
She needed someone there to keep her warm at home
Her words now are so clear in my mind
If I had only read between the lines.
I’ll play another smoke filled bar for tips in a jar
Another lonely night just me and my guitar
But if she would open up her heart to me again
I’d stop running down this road that has no end.

There a little log hut down in old Caroline
All the doors are shut and its covered with vine
That’s where I lived when just a lad
I was happy there with Mother and Dad
Now I’m alone and oh so lonely
I know my heart would be so sad
But if I had my to live over
I’d stay at home with Mother and Dad
I left my home down in old Caroline
I rambled round from time to time
I waited too long to start back home
For the ones I loved had done passed on
Now I’ve got no parents no place to call home
I’m out in this world and I’m on my own
My heart is broke my heart is sad
For I’ve got no home no Mother or Dad

I never thought I’d need you but now I found I’m wrong
Come on back sweet mama back where you belong
I’ve gambled all over town find that I can’t win
So come on back and pick me up again
   Now if I lose let me lose
   I don’t care how much I lose
   If I lose a hundred dollars while I’m trying to win a dime
   My baby she’s got money all the time
Of all the other gals I know no one can take your place
Cause when I get into a jam they just ain’t in the race
So now that you’re back dear let’s take another round
With you here by my side dear the deal just can’t go down

   If I needed you, would you come to me
   Would you come to me for to ease my pain
   If you needed me I could come to you
   I would swim the seas for to ease your pain 
Well the night’s forlorn and the morning’s born
And the morning’s born with the lights of love
And you’ll mis sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two 
Baby’s with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Who could ill agree she’s a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to find

For many years I’ve been a rolling stone, my darling
Like a gypsy I have roamed from place to place
Fortune never came to me
But how happy I would be
Just to look again upon your smiling face
   Now if I should wander back tonight would you be waiting
   Would your eyes be filled with love’s own tender light
   Would your arms be empty, dear would you thrill to find me near
   Would you love me if I’d wander back tonight
When budding flowers lend their fragrance in the springtime
I recall the roses twining round your door
Fancy then I homeward stay and I seem to hear you say
That you love me as you did in days of yore
Last night I dreamed that you and I were back together
I held your hand so gently in my own
Heard you say we’d never part as I pressed you to my heart
Then I woke in tears to find myself alone

It’s true that I love you it’s true you’re not free
I’m trusting in tomorrow that someday you may be
So I’ll go on hoping and trusting in fate
If it takes me a lifetime then I’ll just wait
I’ll cherish the say you and I met
Sweet memories of you I’ll never forget
You lifted me up when I was down
And gave me a smile in place of a frown
I’ll always be waiting it’s never too late
If it takes me a lifetime then I’ll just wait
This waiting is awful but still you are tied
I’m trying my best my feeling to hide
Though people are talking but still I must state
If it takes me a lifetime then I’ll just wait

I went one Sunday evening my true love for to see
I asked her to marry and she would not answer me
The night is almost ended tis near the break of day
I’m waiting for an answer oh what will you say
Dear sir if I must tell you I choose the single life
I never thought it soothing for me to be your wife
Then take this for your answer and for yourself provide
I have another lover and you must be denied
In the course of six weeks later this lady’s mind did change
She wrote me a letter kind sir I feel ashamed
I feel as though I slighted you I cannot hear you mourn
So here’s my heart come take it and claim it as your own
I wrote her back an answer I sent it back in speed
I only once did love you I loved you dear indeed
But since my mind has changed me I seek another way
Upon some pretty fair maiden my heart will have its place
Upon some pretty fair maiden my heart shall have its fill
This world is wide and lonely if one wont another one will

I don’t blame you for I know you want him
That your love for me was never real
I could hold you but you’d be unhappy
But it’s alright if that’s the way you feel
   I know that I will always go on caring
   And my feelings now I must conceal
   I still need you and I want you with me
   But it’s alright if that’s the way you feel
I always knew some day I would lose you
When those lies about me were revealed
Its plain to see sweetheart you believe them
But its alright if that’s the way you feel

Soon we’ll come to the end of life’s journey
And perhaps we’ll never meet anymore
‘Til we gather in heaven’s bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There’s another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet again

Darling I can tell were through
That leavin’ looks all over you
I’ll do anything no matter what you do
Call me if you need a fool
They just aren’t makin’ fools the way that they used to
They don’t come back for more the way I always do
So if you ever change your mind I’m not very hard to find
You can find me in the phone book under blue
Call me if you need a fool
Go and find another guy
And if he don’t believe your lies
You know who will swear every word is true
Call me if you need a fool
Girl it won’t cost you a dime
To break my heart just one last time
Call collect and I’ll just tell um put her through
Call me if you need a fool

   If you’re ever gonna love me well I wanna know it
   There’s just one way that you can show it
   If you don’t start treating me better you see
   I’m gonna do away with me
I’m gonna go down where the water’s little deeper
I’m taking no chances now you’ll see
If you don’t start treating me a little bit better
Well I’m gonna do away with me
Why won’t you tell me how you feel about it
You’re driving me crazy can’t you see
If you don’t start treating me a little bit better
Well I’m gonna do away with me

In a little village churchyard
There I see a grassy mound
There my sweetheart lies a-sleeping
In the cold and silent ground
Gently waves the weeping willow
Birds they warble sweet and low
And there’s no one left to love me
Since my sweetheart had to go
In that little village churchyard
There I stray with a broken heart
There is no one left to love me
Since the day we had to part
That sad day will I remember
When she called me to her side
How I watched her spirit fading
And the tears did blind my sight
Then she said, ‘Goodbye my darling
Dry those teardrops from your eyes
Promise me, my little darling
That you’ll meet me up on high’
In that little village churchyard
There I stray with a broken heart
There is no one left to love me
Since the day we had to part
Oft I’ve wandered to the graveyard
Flowers to plant with tender care
O’er the grave of my dear darling
Darkness finds me weeping there

You made me love you, you made me want you
And now I need you all the time
My heart is sad and I’m so lonely
Each night and day you’re on my mind
   You broke me heart my little darling
   When I called for you, you had another there
   But a broken heart will keep on crying
   I know you know, I’m in despair
You made me forget of all the others
You made me forget of all the past
And I thought sweetheart you really loved me
My friends told me it would never last

In a far away land I’m living in dreams
So often at times I’m with you it seems
But I know I am dreaming when I think of you
In foggy old London across the deep blue
   Deep blue in the ocean it’s so deep and wide
   And I’ve got a notion I’ll cross it tonight
   And I’ll fly like a bluebird up there in the sky
   In foggy old London I’ll find my blue eyes
When your letter came I opened to find
You had been crying while writing each line
But you never mentioned no reason for tears
And foggy old London is so far from here

In my dear old home
I was happy as I could be
Where the mocking birds sang every night while I rest
In that little old log cabin by the sea
There is Mother and dear old Dad
Where I left I know it made them sad
So I’m going back to that dear old shack
Where I spent my happy days as a lad
Goodbye friends I’m leaving today
Goodbye friends I’m going far away
I’ll be happy as can be on my dear old Mother’s knee
In that little old log cabin by the sea

Sittin’ on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straight back chair on two legs, leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playin’ with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin’ fireflies when evening shadows fall.
    In my Tennessee mountain home, life is peaceful as a baby’s sigh
    In my Tennessee mountain home, crickets sing in the fields nearby. 
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence upon the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings
And a songbird on a fencepost sings a melody 
Walking home from church on sunday with the one you love
Just laughin’, talkin’, making future plans
And when the folks aren’t looking you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin’ in the porch swing holdin’ hands.

   In the gravel yard, with a number for my name
   Making little rocks out of big rocks all day
   Oh, the work is mighty hard in the gravel yard
   I’ll never be a free man, so they say
Warden hear my plea, listen now to me
I killed a man that I caught with my wife
You’d probably done the same, so I am not to blame
Sentenced to the rest of my life
In the driven rain with a ball and chain
My hammer rings a low mournful sound
It sings a little song for the ones who done me wrong
Who lie beneath the cold, cold ground

In the highways in the hedges
In the highways in the hedges
In the highways in the hedges
I’ll be somewhere a workin for my Lord
   I’ll be somewhere a workin
   I’ll be somewhere a workin
   I’ll be somewhere a workin
   I’ll be somewhere a workin for my Lord
When he calls me I will answer
When he calls me I will answer
When he calls me I will answer
I’ll be somewhere a workin for my Lord
In the highways in the hedges
In the highways in the hedges
In the highways in the hedges
I’ll be somewhere a workin for my Lord

I had a friend named Ramblin Bob
He used to steal gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy around
Well I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They’ve got him in the jailhouse way downtown
   He’s in the jailhouse now
   He’s in the jailhouse now
   Well, I told him once or twice to
   stop playin cards and shootin dice
   He’s in the jailhouse now
Bob liked to play his poker
Pinochle whist and euchre
But shootin dice was his favorite game
He got throw’d in jail with nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he refused to the fine
Well I went out last Tuesday
I met a girl named Suzie
I said I was the swellest guy around
Well we got to spendin my money
And she started to callin me honey
We took in every cabaret in town
We’re in the jailhouse now

The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o’clock
And the cab passed by at nine
   In the pines, in the pines
   Where the sun never shines
   And we shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I’m on my way back home
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home
My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
But his body was never found

We pass in the hallway almost everyday
Though I’ve never really met him we don’t have too much to say
Though I feel that I know him for every night about this time
When he’s a walkin and a talkin in the room over mine
   He may be thinking of things that might have been
   Or of his family and how he’s missing them
   Oh it’s hard to know what’s going on in a troubled man’s mind
   But I can hear him walking and talking in the room over mine
Well its plain to see he’s had a troubled mind by the lines across
his face
And the sadness that dims his eyes search for a better place
Well I know just how he really feels every night about this time
When he’s a walking and a talking I’ll be in that room of mine

I grew up on the side of Clinch Mountain
With the beauties and the music of the woods
The sweet song of the bright bubbling fountain
and the warble of the birds I understood 
   When I’ve sung my last song in the evening
   And the sun sets in the golden west
   All the scenes of this world I’ll be leaving
   In the shadow of Clinch Mountain I will rest
Long ago said the oak and the cedar
Singing deeply in a whisper of the past
Stood not then this great towering leader
nor the fountain where the crystal gems are kept (passed?)
Then I asked how this green lofty mountain
in the caldron the lonely desert stood
Said this song of the bright sunny fountain
We were given by the waters of the flood 
Out that gate I have passed since my childhood
O’er the railway through the tunnel to the west
singing songs of the Clinch Mountain wildwoods
Song that people found and birds loved the best

We had wandered in the shadow of the pines
The moon looked down on you and me
And a darkness stole across the summer sky
And a shadow came between my love and me
   Oh, darling, come love me as before
   Come back to leave me nevermore
   At that spot I’m sad and lonely
   And the sun no longer shines
   Come and meet me in the shadow of the pines
Oh, you went away and left me and my tears I could not hide
You went away and not a word was said
While my throbbing heart was breaking underneath its load of pride
And the pine trees sobbed in pity o’er my head
   
All our future is o’er shadowed by the darkness of despair
And across life’s path the sun no longer shines
Oh, I’d give this whole world gladly once again to meet her there
And reunite in the shadow of the pines

As we sit alone tonight
In the stillness of the night
I picture happy scenes of long ago
Of a maiden fair and bright
Who is sleeping there tonight
In the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
It was in the month of June
When the roses were in bloom
When I held her in my arms and softly said
Darling in the coming spring
I’ll be coming back again
To the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
When I left her all alone
In our Shenandoah home
She promised she’d be waiting there for me
But the angels came along
And took her from our home
From the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
When the evening shadows fall
In memory I recall
A pledge when giving her a ring
Darling in the coming spring
I’ll be coming back again
To the valley of the Shenandoah ridge

Gonna read the good book every day
Gonna let the Savior show me the way
Gonna let Him take me by the hand
As I walk along to the promised land
    Home home I’m goin home
    Goin down that innocent road
Gonna take a swim in the river wide
Gonna lay my burdens on the other side
Gonna take a walk down the Jerico road
Gonna lay down my heavy load
Goin to rejoice when the angels sing
Gonna take a ride on the speckled wing
Gonna see my friends and my loved ones there
All eternal joys we can share

There’s an iron curtain darlin’ That’s between your heart and mine
and it seems its getting stronger all the time
You don’t want me you don’t need me But I’ll keep on hangin’ ’round
And I know someday my love will tear that iron curtain down
    Don’t be afraid to love me for I know that it will last
   Darlin is it fair to judge me by someone in your past
   You don’t want me you don’t need me but I’ll keep on hangin’ ’round
   And I know someday my love will tear that iron curtain down
Someone’s hurt you in the past dear and the memory lingers on
But to live your life in darkness is a shame
If you’ll only let me love you soon your heartaches will be gone
Let my lovin arms become your iron curtain from now on

You lie in our bed and dream of another
You don’t even know you whisper his name
And now if your heart belongs to another
Oh what will I do, you’re driftin away
   Our once happy home is lonely and dark now
   Have you went astray and broken your vows
   I just can’t believe these things that I’m hearing
   You’re breakin my heart is it over now
I wish that I knew what happened to you dear
And I only hope we’ll make it somehow
But that doesn’t change the way that I’m feeling
It hurts me to say that it’s over now

   Is it too late now to tell you that I love you
   Or is there still a chance for me somehow
   Oh they tell me now that you have found another
   Darlin’ please don’t say it’s too late now
I know this heart of mine could never stand it
If I should have togive you up somehow
Oh won’t you say that you’ll give me one more chance dear
Darlin’ please don’t say it’s too late now
Well I confess I know I done you wrong, dear
Oh can’t you see my side again somehow
All I ask of you is to give me one more chance dear
Darlin’ please don’t say it’s too late now.

Is it true that you are leavin’
That you’re go-in’ far away
Is it true that you don’t love me
Is there nothin’ you can say
    Is it true that you love another
   That you just want to be free
   You know I’d never try to hold you
    If you no longer love me
Is it true the words you told me
Now are told to someone new
While my heart is slowly breakin’
Tell me dar-lin’ is it true
Is it true you’ll soon forget me
After we have said goodbye
Is it true that you’ll be happy
While I sit alone and cry

You rolled out of Rosine a dedicated man
You drove those country back roads to a thousand one-night stands
The music from your mandolin, spread like wildfire in the wind
And echoed through the hollows and the hills, so tell me, Bill
   Is the grass any bluer on the other side
   Did it look like gold Kentucky when the gates swung open wide
   Bet the good Lord’s got you playin’ somewhere up there every night
   Is the grass any bluer on the other side
I heard you on the Opry when I was just a kid
I tried my best to learn to sing and play the way you did
Just like me the day you died, the guitars and the fiddles cried
The music ain’t the same without you Bill, we miss you still
Just like me the day you died, the guitars and the fiddles cried
The music ain’t the same without you Bill, we miss you still-ill-ill

In this world of broken hearted
You can sing about my one and only pain
Now I cry my eyes and wonder
Will I walk this dark and lonely road again
Is there one more hope for this heartbreak
Is there one last chance or goodbye
If I had one wish I would end all this heartache
Oh I wonder how long I could cry
You could count the stars in heaven
You could count a million waves on the sea
You’ll never know how many teardrops
That I shed for somethin’ never meant to be
Without love in this lifetime
You can count on little boys bein’ blue
So don’t wait until tomorrow
You may never find yourself a love so true

Today I’m here thinking about you
It seems I don’t know what to do
No way turn nothing to love for
It hurts to know that I’ve lost you
It hurts to know you’re with another
After what you put me through
It hurts to start my life all over
To start all over without you
Someday my darling he will leave you
Just like the one he left before
And then you’ll know how much it hurts you
You’ll cry, can’t sleep and walk the floor

Little girl you stand out in the crowd
You’re laughing and talking much too loud
But I see a little tear peaking through
It takes one to know one and I know you
   It takes one to know one and I know you
   The little tear through your smiles I see through
   You’ve been hurt and your frightened you’re so blue
   It takes one to know one and I know you
 Little girl please take hold of my hand
Just go right on and cry I’ll understand
Pay no mind if start crying too
It takes one to know one and I know you

Woke up yesterday and you told me you were leavin’
Left a note sayin’ prob’ly wouldn’t be back
But you’ll come back again now and I got new for you dear
You won’t have a home and that’s a fact
   Don’t you come back on your knees Askin’ my forgiveness
   Pack your bags and move on down the line
   Don’t you roll those eyes at me tellin’ me you’re sorry
   It’s too late babe and it won’t work this time
I’ve always been around lord when you needed someone
I played the role tell I knew each line by heart
But now it’s time to change won’t you find another playmate
Someone who might want to play the part

   It’s a long long road to wander all alone.
   It’s a cold cold wind hear it moan.
    Crying like a lost child out in the night.
    Searching for the way and looking for the light.
Back in the days when we were happy
Our love was the warmth and the light.
But now the dark shadows are falling
And day is quickly fading into night.
When the sun goes down behind the mountain
And the chilly wind is blowing through the pines.
How often do I think about my darling
And the sunny garden where the roses twine.

   It’s good to see you, so good to see you
   Oh how I’ve missed you since I’ve been gone
   Cause I’ve crossed the ocean, travelled through many lands
   And it’s good to see you, to be in your home. 
There’s something in me that makes me wonder
There’s many a land I have to see
And when I’m far away in a land of strangers
I know my good friends think on me. 
Oh it’s a wonder when it comes to friendship
No matter how far, no matter how long
There’s a constant thread that’s never broken
And it ties me to my friends at home

You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall but it won’t fall
Kiss me when your dreamin no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you
You can send me pretty flowers
You can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won’t pay
Bend to my desires nothing else will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you
You can give me your affection
You can give me all your love
Give me all the things I crave but I’ll be brave
All the things you offer make me sad and blue
It’s goodbye and so long to you
You can call me your own darling
You can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won’t be home
Keep your old love letters I’m all through with you
It’s goodbye and so long to you

It’s grand to have someone to love you
Someone who knows your every care
Someone to cheer you when you’re lonely
Just call for her and she’ll be there
The kind of love that you can treasure
The kind of love that stands the test
It’s grand to have someone to love you
Someone to hold you to their breast
It’s grand to have someone to love you
Who thinks you’re king upon her throne
Then she’s the queen of all your treasures
Your castle is a happy home

Troubles come and I can’t find an answer
Lonely nights I spend in agony
I have no other friend that I can turn to
So here I am Lord back upon my knees
 
    It’s me again Lord I’ve got a prayer I need an answer
    It’s me again Lord I’ve got a problem I can’t solve
    Well I don’t mean to worry you but here I am facing something new
    And I need help that only comes from You it’s me again Lord
I know You’re mighty busy in Your Heaven
Forming worlds and hanging stars to shine
But You promised if I’d ask that I could see them
So here I am Lord asking one more time

   It’s mighty dark for me to travel
   For my sweetheart she is gone
   The road is rough and filled with gravel
   But I must journey on and on
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love
Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I’ll meet her there
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who’s gone
Knowing soon we’ll be together
She’s the only love I’ve known

Now darling I’ve loved I’ve never done wrong
I’ve been fair to you you know all along
Why treat me this way you’re breaking my heart
I’m lonesome for you we’re so far apart
   Its never too late to start over new
   I’ve loved you so long you know I’ve been true
   Please come back to me my heart is so blue
   It’s never to late to start over new
Now when you are tired your new love’s gone down
I hope you’ll return I’ll still be around
I love you so well you know I will wait
But remember these words it’s never too late

She would sit by her window and gaze out
Down the road where her children had gone
One by one they left seeking their fortune
And left their old mother alone
Sometime late at night she would call me
Sir did I here a knock at the door
I would say it was only the wind man
Just as I had told her before
It’s only the wind
Your children are not at the door
It’s only the wind
The wind restless wind nothing more
Sometime she would talk of her children
Of her son and her daughter so fair
She said they were much like the wild wind
They sometime neglected to care
One night I heard somebody knocking
But I saw as I went to the door
She was there in her chair by the window
Her eyes closesd in rest forever more

Oh it’s raining, raining, raining here this morning
As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they’ve given me a number for my name 
   Many a little raindrops are falling close to me
   Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be
   It’s raining, raining, raining here this morning
   As the Mississippi flows on to the sea 
How I wish that I could see my little darling
And hold her in my arms just as before
I used to tell her every day I loved her
But now she doesn’t love me anymore 
   She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime
   And said that she’d be waiting there for me
   But she has found somewhere else to wander
   Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 
Its raining, raining, raining here this morning
And I am just as weary as can be
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea 
   But there’s no way to prove that I’m not guilty
   So I will have to suffer all the shame
   Go and tell her for me little raindrops
   That they’ve given me a number for my name

You can send me pretty flowers you can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won’t pay
Leap to my desire, nothing else will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you
You can hang around and love me you can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall but I won’t fall
Kiss me when you’re dreaming, no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you
You can give me your affection you can give all your love
Give me all the things I’ll crave but I’ll be brave
All the things you offer, make me sad and blue
It’s goodbye and so long to you
You can call my your own darling you can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won’t be home
Keep your old love letters, I’m all through with you
It’s goodbye and so long to you

I’m gonna get my picture took
And then I’ll have it painted blue
To show you how I’m looking now
Because I loved and trusted you
I’m gonna get my picture took
Just a wee forget me not
A small reminder of the one
Who loved you true but you forgot
I’m gonna get my picture took
I’ll even put it in a frame
So you can see the harm you’ve done
Every time you hear my name

When were young we fell in love and married
That’s been so many moons ago
And through these years we’ve raised a family
I’ve cherished each moment with you Rose
But to my surprise last night you told me
You said that we would have to part
So you must know tonight my Rosie
That I’m too old to stand a broken heart
Now the children they have gone and left us
They all have families of their own
And we’re alone just like we started
In our peaceful little country home

   Hallelujah to Jesus who died on the tree
   To raise up his ladder of mercy for me
   Press onward climb upward the top is in view
   There’s a crown of bright glory awaiting for you
As Jacob was travellin was weary one day
His head on a stone for a pillow did lay
A vision appeared of a ladder so high
It stood on the earth while the top reached the sky
This ladder was tall and yet so well made
Stood thousands of years and never decayed
High winds from the heaven’s they reeled and they rocked
But the angels they guarded from bottom to top

Takes a rocking chair to rock takes a rubber tire to roll
Takes the man I love to satisfy my soul
Because I’m jealous jealous hearted me
I said I’m jealous jealous as I can be
Got a stove in the kitchen and it bakes nice and brown
But I need a poppa to turn the damper down
Because I’m jealous jealous hearted me
I said I’m jealous jealous as I can be
You can have my money you can have my home
But for goodness sake women leave my man alone
Because I’m jealous jealous hearted me
I said I’m jealous jealous as I can be
Gonna buy me a bulldog to watch him while I sleep
To watch that man of mine on his midnight creep
Because I’m jealous jealous hearted me
I said I’m jealous jealous as I can be

    Jesus is a rock hallelujah
    He is a rock amen
    He is a rock hallelujah
    He is a rock
    Jesus is a rock amen

There’s no future in building
A house upon the sinking sand
Why not build a home eternal
Forever on the rock we stand
There’s no harm can overtake you
While you’re holding to his hand
He will never ever leave you
He is the solid rock my friend

Jesus Savior pilot me
Over life’s tempestuous sea
Chart and compass come from thee
Jesus Savior pilot me
    Unknown waves before me roll
    Hiding rock and treacherous shoal
    Chart and compass come from thee
    Jesus Savior pilot me
When at last I near the shore
And the fearful breakers roar
May I hear thee say to me
Fear not I will pilot thee
    ‘twixt me and the peaceful rest
    Then while leaning on thy breast
    May I hear thee say to me
    Fear not I will pilot thee

Jim Blake your wife is dying
Went over the wires tonight
The message was brought to the depot
By a lad all trembling with fright
He entered the office crying
His face was terribly white
Send this message to dad and his engine
Mother is dying tonight
In something less than an hour
Jim’s message back to me flew
Tell wife I’ll be there at midnight
I’m praying for her too
I left my son in the office
Took the message to Jim’s wife
There I found the dying woman
Was scarce of breath and life
O’er hill and dale and valley
Thunders the heavy train
His engine is sobbing and throbbing
And under a terrible strain
But Jim hangs onto his throttle
Guiding her crazy flight
And his voice cries out in the darkness
God speed the express tonight
I telephoned the doctor
How is Jim’s wife I asked
About the hour of midnight
Is long as she can last
In something less than an hour
The train will be along
But here I have a message
Oh god there is something wrong
The message reads disaster
The train is in the ditch
The engineer is dying
Derailed by an open switch
And there is another message
To Jim’s wife it is addressed
I’ll meet you at midnight in heaven
Wait for the fast express

I sell the morning paper sir
My name is Jimmie Brown
Everybody knows me
I’m the newsboy of the town
You can hear me yelling “Morning Star”
Walking on the street
Got no hat upon my head
No shoes upon my feet
Never mind sir how I look
Don’t swear at me and frown
I sell the morning paper sir
My name is Jimmie Brown
I’m awful cold and hungry sir
My clothes are mighty thin
Wander about from place to place
My daily bread to win
My father was a drunkard sir
I’ve heard my mother say
I am helping mother sir
As I journey on my way
My mother always tells me sir
I’ve nothing in the world to lose
I’ll get a place in heaven sir
To sell the gospel news

Hey momma here’s a letter from your son

and it ain’t been three weeks since I came
Hey momma
I do remember what you said

and remember city women ain’t the same
    I’m like a John Deere tractor in a half acre field
    trying to plow a furrow where the soil is made of steel
    Oh I wish I was home Ma where the bluegrass is growin’
    and the sweet country girls don’t complain
Hey momma
so much perfume I thought I’d drown
and the Lord didn’t seem to be nowhere around
hey I fell like a flower from the vine
Ah she was pretty lord knows
I thought she would bring me joy
she laughed she called me country boy ma
and after she had been so kind
    I’m like a John Deere tractor in a half acre field
    trying to plow a furrow where the soil is made of steel
    oh I wish I was home ma where the bluegrass is growin’
    and the fire light shimmers and shines.

The tears running down from his eyes
He said I’ve been the death of many a poor boy
But my six-shooters never told a lie
No, my six-shooters never told a lie
The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue

John Henry was a little baby boy
You could hold him on the palm of your hand
And his Papa cried out this lonesome farewell
Son you’re gonna be a steel driving man lord, lord
Son you’re gonna be a steel driving man
John Henry went up on the mountain
Looked down on the other side
Lord the mountain was so tall John Henry was so small
He laid down his hammer and he cried poor boy
Laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry walked through the tunnel
Had his captain by his side
The last words that John Henry said was bring me
Cool drink of what ‘for I die lord, lord
Cool drink of what ‘for I die
Talk about John Henry as much as you please
Say and do all that you can
There never was born in these United States
No such a steel driving man lord, lord
No such a steel driving man
John Henry told his captain
I want to go to bed
Lord fix me a pallet, I want to lay down
Got a mighty roaring in my head lord, lord
Mighty roaring in my head

John Henry was a little bitty boy
No bigger than the palm of your hand
He picked up a hammer and little piece of stell
Johnny gonna make a steel drivin man, Lord Lord
Johnny gonna make a steel drivin man
John Henry told his captain
The next time you go to town
Can you bring John back a nine pound hammer
I’m gonna beat that steam drill down, Lord Lord
I’m gonna beat that steam drill down
John Henry he told his shaker
Shaker you better pray
For if I miss that old little piece of steel
Tomorrow’ll be your buryin’ day, Lord Lord
Tomorrow’ll be your buryin’ day
When they invented that old steam drill
They thought that they had ’em somethin’ fine
John Henry sank her fourteen feet
Steam drill only made her nine, Lord Lord
Steam drill only made her nine
John Henry was on the right hand side
The steam drill was on the left
Said before I will let that drill beat me down
I’ll hammer my old fool self to death, Lord Lord

You can talk about John Henry as much as you want
Sing and do all that you can
But there was never born in the United States
No such a steel drivin’ man, Lord Lord
No such a steel drivin’ man

Johnson boys raised in the ashes
Didn’t know how to court a maid
Turn their backs and hide their faces
Sight of a pretty girl makes ’em afraid
Sight of a pretty girl makes ’em afraid
Sight of a pretty girl makes ’em afraid

Johnson boys went a-huntin’
Took two dogs and went astray
Tore their clothes and scratched their faces
Didn’t come home ’til the break of day
Didn’t come home ’til the break of day
Didn’t come home ’til the break of day

Johnson boys went a-courtin’
Coon creek girls so pretty and sweet
They couldn’t make no conversation
Didn’t know where to put their feet
Didn’t know where to put their feet
Didn’t know where to put their feet

God sent Jonah to the Ninevah land
To preach the gospel to the wicked men
Tell them to repent of their wicked ways
Or I’ll overthrow the city in forty days
   God moves in a windstorm
   He rode in a windstorm
   God moves in a windstorm
   And he troubled everybody in their mind
Jonah went down to the seashore
To make up his mind which way to go
He boarded the ship and paid his fare
And God got angry with Jonah down there
Jonah went down from the side of man
And he called on Jesus to be his friend
Disobeyed God and he had to pray
The Lord sent a storm on the water that day
They cast poor Jonah overboard
God sent a whale and swallowed him whole
Went on down to the Ninevah land
And laid poor Jonah on a bed of sand
Jonah rose up from the sand
Went on walking to the Ninevah land
He preached the gospel at His command
Repent, repent you wicked men

Oh come and as you tread life’s journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and safely
Without him walkin by your side
But when you come to make the crossing
At the ending of your pilgrim way
If you ever will need our Savior
You’ll surely need him on that day
   (Now look at that) cold Jordan
   (Look at its) deep waters
   (Look at that) wide river
   Oh hear the mighty billows roll
   (You better take) Jesus with you
   (He’s a) true companion
   (For I’m) sure without him
   That you never will make it o’er
That awful day of judgment
Is comin’ in the by and by
We’ll see our Lord descending
In Glory from on high
Oh let us keep in touch with Jesus
And in his place a love of God
We may be ever call ready
When he calls us over Jordan’s tide
   (Oh what) oh what you gonna do
   (Oh what) oh what you gonna say
   (Oh how) oh how you gonna feel
   When you come to the end of the way

I’m gonna sing you a brand new song
It’s all the truth for certain
We can’t live high if we get by
And get on the other side of Jordan
   Oh pull off your overcoat and roll up your sleeves
   Jordan is a hard road to travel
   Pull off your overcoat and roll up your sleeves
   Jordan is a hard road to travel I believe.
The public schools and the highways
are causing quite an alarm
Get a country boy educated just a little
and he won’t work on the farm
Now I don’t know but I believe I’m right
the auto’s ruined the country
Let’s get back to the horse and buggy
and try to save some money.
I know a man an evangelist
his tabernacle’s always full
The people come from miles around
just to hear him shoot the bull
You can talk about your evangelists
you can talk about Mr. Ford too
But Henry’s shaking more hell out of the folks
than all the evangelists do.

My life was filled with such sorrow
A soul with no one to care
God heard my prayer and He called me
I’ll meet my Lord way up there
    A golden rainbow lights the way
    Up the path I will ascend
    To the kingdom up on high
    Is my home at journey’s end
His love was so sweet and so faithful
His life he gave for you and me
Trial and temptation seemed endless
But he rose over all eternity
There’s many here on this journey
So heavy the burdens they bear
As they reach up toward the heaven
He’ll hear their voices in prayer

Julianne what are you doing, making plans on leaving me?
Have I made your life unhappy, is this how it’s got to be?
Will you be here in the morning when the rooster starts to crow?
Will my tears be all that’s called for Julianne? I’ve got to know
   Dress yourself in silk and satin, put some ribbons in your hair
   But don’t say you’re gonna leave me, it’s more than I can bear
   Go and have your night of dancing if you like those country songs
   But when all the fun is over, Julianne, come on home
Julianne, you know I love you, I can’t live my life alone
Is there some way I can please you, tell me what could keep you home
I’ve got no gold and silver, got no diamonds for your hand
All I have is love, this love I’ll give you Oh, I need you, Julianne

Just a few more days of sorrow just a few more days of pain
Just a few more days of cloudiness Just a few more days of rain
Then I’m gonna live Jesus he has got a home prepared
Then I’ll join the Holy Angels mother will be waiting there
Not so long ago one morning mother called me to her bed
Then she put her arms around me listen to what she said
Darlin I am going to leave you but you’ll not be left alone
Jesus will protect and shield you after he has called me home
Sometimes I am sorely tempted sometimes I am sorely tried
But to overcome I’m trying taking Jesus for my guide
Though sometimes the path seems rugged but it only makes me pray
And I know if I keep trying I’ll see my mother some sweet day

I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
   Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
   Let us tell Him all about our troubles
   He will hear our faintest cry
   He will answer by and by
   Now when you feel a little prayerwheel turning
   And you know a little fire is burning
   You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path seems drear without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to Him in prayer He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Makes everything right

When time shall come for my leaving
When I bid you adieu
Don’t spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do
I’ll go to a beautiful garden
When my life’s work is through
Don’t spend your money for flowers
Just a rose will do
I want a good old-time preacher
To preach the gospel truth
I want no tales of my history
Then just a rose will do
I’ll need no organization
To make a big to-do
Just have some good old-time singing
Then just a rose will do

I ain’t gonna worry who’s kissin’ you
When you’re far away
Because I know when the tomcat’s gone
All the mice will play
I ain’t gonna worry what’s goin’ on when you’re
Out to paint the town
I ain’t gonna worry where you stay
When you’re out runnin’ ’round. 
 I just ain’t (just ain’t)
I just ain’t (just ain’t)
Just ain’t. 
 I ain’t gonna worry what’s goin’ on
When I’m home sleepin’ in bed.
I ain’t gonna watch for you to come in
And go to sleep instead.
I ain’t gonna follow you where you go
A walkin’ down the street
I ain’t gonna care about (who’s) the other guy
That you go to meet. 
 I ain’t gonna care if you don’t come back
I’ll get along all right.
I ain’t gonna mind this livin’ alone
I’ll still sleep at night.
I ain’t gonna worry where you go
And when you say goodbye
I’ll find someone else to love
I ain’t gonna sit and cry.

They stood on the beach one evening
Out in the moonlight fair
Twas a boy in the pride of manhood
And a girl in beauty rare
I never had thought that you loved me
An innocent look of surprise
Crept out from beneath her lashes
And into those deep brown eyes
   
   Oh sir I was only flirting
   Only a playing a part
   Just another boy’s life ruined
   Just another broken heart
Sir I’m to be married this winter
Farewell and she gave me her hand
And drawing a robe around her
She left me alone on the sand
He goes with a crowd of passers
Always bitter and cold
Just another boy grown weary
Just another boy grown old
There’s a rose grows in your garden
White rose is the symbol of peace
And when I am dead little darling
Plant that rose at my head and my feet
   Oh sir I was only flirting
   Only a playing a part
   Just another boy’s life ruined
   Just another broken heart

Just another day how can I stand it
Without my baby by my side
This empty feeling now inside me
Is bound to show but I can’t cry
Just make mine straight without a chaser
And let me drown my blues this way
The seat beside me now is empty
Nothing to live for just another day
A thief could rob and take my money
If death was pending I could pray
I’m helpless now what can my fate be
Everything is gone just another day

Love like this was never known
Though you search the whole world ’round
Jesus dying for his own
Just as the sun went down
Just as the evenin’ sun
Was sinkin’ in the golden west
Hanging between two thieves
They crucified the Son of God
Mocked by the multitudes
They placed on Him a thorny crown
Love like this was never known
Jesus dying for His own
Just as the sun went down
By Sanhedron He was tried
Have no use for Him they cried
By the mob He was crucified
Just as the sun went down

Well I’ve traveled around this world
I’ve seen lots of pretty girls
No one like you no one like you
For your love is warm and kind
And it eases a noisy mind
Lovin’ you just lovin’ you
The sweetest love I ever knew
Is the love I get from you
I always keep on lovin’ you
You hold the key to my heart
And I know we’ll never part
Forever I’ll be lovin’ you
Oh I know there is no doubt
You’re the one I can’t live without
I’m lovin’ you only you
My every dream now is real
And I know I always will
Be lovin’ you just lovin you
After travelin’ around this world
There is no other girl
To take the place of lovin’ you
We’ve known each other for so long
and our love is holding strong
I’ll always keep on lovin’ you

I saw you last night through the tears in my eyes
The dance floor was crowded and I realized
The thoughts you were having as you danced by my way
While I was one teardrop and one step away
    Just one teardrop and one step away
    My heart will be broken til my dyin day
    Your eyes told the story of the price I must pay
    While I was one teardrop and one step away
I know I will miss you and my heart will never mend
If we can’t live together at least lets part as friends
I know I will miss you every single day
While I was one teardrop and one step away

Well it’s Friday night at the Legion hall in some Alberta town
And from the stage I see you as you look me up and down
Later on you’ll ask me if I’ll share some time with you
I’ll say sorry honey not tonight I’m just a passin’ through
Now I may be a stranger to this little country town
But in your eyes I recognize a man who gets around
You say you want to be with me and make my dreams come true
But I pay no mind I know your kind and I’m just a passin’ through
They tell me that they’ve never heard a singer quite so sweet
And when I play the fast ones it just knocks them them off their feet
Well I don’t mind the compliment but I’m nobody’s fool
I don’t pay no mind they’re not my kind
and I’m a just a passin’ through
Well I don’t know how many times before I’ve met a man like you
Who thinks I’m something special on account of what I do
I can tell you I’m no different from the girl who cooks for you
I’m just cookin’ on this old guitar and I’m singin’ songs for you
Don’t think that you’re the only one it happens all the time
You cowboys think you’ll win my prize by handing me a line
Why don’t you let me sing my songs there’s other girls to woo
And I’ll make a bet you you won’t regret that I was just a passin’ through
Well nobody told me this is how I’d have to pay my dues
But I’ll be long gone before too long ’cause I’m just a passin’ through

Just when I needed you you left and went away
You made my life so blue both night and day
You left me here behind with a troubled worried mind
So broken hearted too just when I needed you
   I cried I cried I prayed I tried
   To forget you and never call your name
   What a shame what a shame you’re the one that was to blame
   You’re the one that proved untrue just when I needed you
You said it’s best to part and never love again
And though it broke my heart I won’t complain
You know I love you still and dear I always will
Although you proved untrue just when I needed you

Tonight I’m alone, I’m thinking of you dear
For yesterday you told me goodbye
Oh why did you leave and where are you going
I’m hear all alone, just wondering why 
   I can’t understand, sweetheart, why you left me
   You told me your love would never die
   Then you went away and left me so lonely
   Now I’m all alone, just wondering why
Wherever you go in this world my darling
I’ll never think of no one but you
When you went away, you left me so lonely
And that’s why today I’m feeling so blue

Oh Katie dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we’ll run away
 
Oh Willie dear there’s no use in asking
She’s in her room a takin’ rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best
 
Oh Katie dear go ask your father
If you can be a bride of mine
If he says yes come back and tell me
If he says no we’ll run away
 
Oh Willie dear, there’s no need in asking
He’s in his room a takin’ rest
And by his side is a golden dagger
To slay the one that I love best
 
So he picked up that golden dagger
And stove it through his troubled heart
Saying goodbye Katie goodbye darlin’
At last the time has come to part
 
So she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lily-white breast
Saying goodbye papa goodbye mama
I’ll die with the one that I love best

Well now, who does not know Katy Cline
She lives at the foot of the hill
By the shady nook of some old babbling brook
That runs by her dear old father’s mill
   Tell me that you love me Katy Cline
   Tell me that your love’s as true as mine
   Tell me that you love your own turtle dove
   Tell me that you love me Katy Cline
It’s way from my little cabin door
Oh it’s way from my little cabin home
There’s no one to weep and there’s no one to mourn
And there’s no one to see Katy Cline
If I was a little bird
I’d never build my nest on the ground
I’d build my nest in some high yonder tree
Where the wild boys couldn’t tear it down

With her old man she came from Tipperary
In the pioneering days of ’42
Her old man was shot in Tombstone City
For the making of his good old mountain dew
   Oh Come on down the mountain Katy Daley
   Come on down the mountain Katy do
   Can’t you hear us calling Katy Daley
   We want to drink your good old mountain dew
Wake up and pay attention Katy Daley
For I’m the judge that’s gonna sentence you
All the boys in court have drunk your whiskey
To tell the truth I like a little too
So to the jail they took poor Katy Daley
And pretty soon the gates were open wide
Angels came for poor old Katy Daley
Took her far across the great divide

Keep a memory of our love dear
Never ever let it stray
Why betray the heart you’ve broken
I’ll find happiness some way. 
   When I think about you darling
   I often hang my head and cry
   Words just can’t explain my feelings
   Just to know I’ve lived a lie 
When our old friends ask about you
Many times I can’t reply
Just the thought of your name darling
Makes me wish that I could die.

If you should wonder back this way when you are lonely too
Don’t look for me for I will be long gone
I told you once before you left that I was through with you
You can’t expect a man to linger on
You are old enough to know that a man’s love will not go
When you take up with some one who you think’s a little more fun
If you don’t find a welcome mat a-lying in your way
Just keep on going is all that I can say
I got your letter yesterday you wanted to come home
But I’ve been happy since you’ve been away
I told you once before you left that I was through with you
So keep on going is all that I can say

If you’re in the battle for the lord and right
Just keep on the firing line
If you win the battle then surely you must fight
So keep on the firing line
   Brother keep on the firing line
   Keep on the firing line
   Time is getting short Jesus coming soon
   Brother keep on the firing line
There are many dangers everyone must face
If you die fighting there is no disgrace
With the lord for coward you will find no place
So keep on the firing line
God can only use the soldier he can trust
To keep on the firing line
If you wear the crown bear the cross you must
So keep on the firing line

There’s a dark and a troubled side of life
There’s a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view
   Keep on the sunny side   always on the sunny side
   Keep on the sunny side of life
   It will help us every day it will brighten all our way
   If we keep on the sunny side of life
Oh the storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear
Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us every one in His care

Keep the lamp on Sadie let it shine
Leave it on so I can see
Keep the lamp on Sadie let it shine
So I can find may way from the fields back to you
I know we need to talk things over
I know things haven’t gone so good
Keep the lamp on Sadie let it shine
So I can find my way back home to you
It’s been a rough year for the things we are pullin’
And the banks is buggin’ us about what’s due
And I know it worries you because it’s so
But right now there’s not too much we can do
I’m gonna need you by my side
so Sadie lets survive
And fight this thing to the bitter end
And keep the lamp on Sadie let it shine
So I can find my way back home to you
I’ve got an uncle in St Louis who just might help us
Get over this dry spell we have now
We can sell a couple of things we have no need for
And that will help us get our feet back on the ground
But if you leave me I don’t think that I can manage
Sadie keep the lamp on if you can
So keep the lamp on Sadie let it shine
So I can find my way back home to you

Kentucky you are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky your laurels and your red bud trees
When I die I want to rest upon your graceful mountain so high
Kentucky that is where God will look for me
Kentucky I miss the voices singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky I miss the hound dog chasing coon
I know that my mother dad & sweetheart all are waiting for me
Kentucky I will be coming soon 
Kentucky you are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky I will be coming soon

   Kentucky girl are you lonesome tonight
   Kentucky girl do you miss me
   Does that old moon shine on the bluegrass as bright
   As it did on the night you first kissed me
In a valley ‘neath the mountains so high
The sweetest place in all the world
In a cabin with the vines o’er the door
That’s where I left my Kentucky girl
I’m far away from old Kentucky tonight
And the blue eyed girl that I love so
But I’m heading home in the silvery moonlight
With open arms she waits I know

How the sad wind moans on Kentucky Mountain
And the rain is falling in her face
And by her side in the lonely graveyard
I want to lie down and take my place
She sleeping on Kentucky Mountain
And the rain is falling in her face
And by her side when this life is over
I’ll lay me down and take my place
We fell in love there in the mountains
Our love was beautiful and free
She was so young when the maker called her
I guess she was not meant for me
I’m like a lonesome dove at twilight
As she flies around from tree to tree
My aching heart is full of sorrow
Since never more my love I’ll see

We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
‘Neath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz

They called old John from the island
And they put him in the kettle to boil
And the Lord came down from heaven above
And they tell me that the oil wouldn’t boil
    Oh he had the keys to the kingdom
    And the faith unlocked the door
    Oh he had the keys to the kingdom Lord
    And the world couldn’t do him no harm
The king said to the Hebrew
When they were about to sound
Before you worship that idol God
Get ready to bow down
Well they put old Paul and Silas
Down in the jail below
While one did sing and the other did shout
And the angel unlocked the door
Go get your trumpet Gabriel
And move down by the sea
But don’t you blow that trumpet
Until you hear from me
When you think that you’ve been living right
And serving God every day
Just fall down on our bended knees
He’ll hear every word you say

As I went down to the huckleberry picnic
Dinner all over the ground
Skeppers in the meat was nine foot deep
And the green flies walking all around
The biscuits in the oven was a-baking
Beefsteak frying in the pan
Pretty gal sitting in the parlour
Lord God A’mighty what a hand I stand
    Whoa there mule I tell you
   Miss Liza you keep cool
   I ain’t got time to kiss you now
   I’m busy with this mule
My uncle had an old mule
His name was Simon Slick
Love anything I ever did see
But how that mule could kick
Went to feed that mule one morning
And he met me at the door with a smile
He backed one ear and he winked one eye
And he kicked me half a mile

I know a little girl and I want her for my wife
She’s pretty and sweet neat little feet and never been kissed in her life
You can ask her for a kiss she said oh what a bore
Every time she bows and declares she’ll never do so anymore
   
   Born to be a better girl and never kiss again
   Afraid my ma might find it out and cause her great pain
   You may walk and talk and hold my hand but kissing is a crime
   I’ll not kiss you anymore until next time
I called at her house one night but I didn’t intend to stay
She laid her head on my shoulder and said the old folks are away
I kissed her a dozen times and someone came to the door
Every time she bowed and declared she’d never do so anymore
She’ll see you too the door kiss and then goodnight
Every time she bows and declares she’ll never do so any more

Waltz Kitty waltz let everybody waltz

I’ve just been thinkin’ things over
My heart is swollen with tears
My life just don’t seem worth livin’
And it’s been that way for years
     My skys above turned to gray now
    And I just walked the soles off my shoes
   I don’t have too much to say now
   I’m just knee deep in the blues
Don’t ask me why I’m cryin’
Cause I have lost about all I can lose
Well there’s just no use in tryin’
I’m just knee deep in the blues

Kneel at the cross, Christ will meet you there
Come while He waits for you
Listen to His voice, leave with Him your cares
And begin life anew
   Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
   Leave every care, leave every care
   Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
   Jesus will meet you there
Kneel at the cross, there’s room for all
Who will his glory share
Bliss there awaits, harm can nary fall
Those who are anchored there
Kneel at the cross, give your idols up
Look unto realms above
Turn not away, to life’s sparkling cup
Trust only in His love

I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every Sunday evening
Out in her home I’d dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
Oh Willie Dear don’t kill me here
I’m not prepared to die
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls
And dragged her round and round
Throwing her into the river
That flows through Knoxville Town

Oh there’s a lamp shining bright in the cabin
in a window that’s shining for me
And I know that my mother is praying
for the boy she is longing to see
   when it’s lamp lighting time in the valley
   in my dreams I go back to my home
   Oh I can see that old lamp in the window
   it will guide me wherever I roam.
By the lamplight tonight I can see her
as she rocks in her chair to and fro
Oh she’s praying that I’ll come back to see her
and I know that I never can go.

   Oh the wind blows cold
    On the trail of the buffalo
    Oh the wind blows cold
   In the land of the Navajo
    In the land of the Navajo
A hundred miles from nowhere out on the desert sand
One Eyed Jack the trader hold some turquoise in his hand
By his side sat Running Elk his longtime Indian friend
He vowed that he would stay by Jack until the bitter end
Jack had gambled everything he owned to leave this wondering life
He might have had a happy home and a tender loving wife
But his hunger was for trading trapper’s furs for turquoise stones
Anything that the Indians had Jack wanted for his own
Said Jack to Running Elk I’ll gamble all my precious stones
Before I leave my body here among these bleaching bones
Though now my time is drawing near and I’m filled with dark regrets
My spirit longs to journey as the sun begins to set
We raped and killed we stole your land
We rule with guns and knives add whiskey to your waters
While we stole away your wives
said Running Elk what’s done is done you white men rule this land
so lay the cards face up and play your last broken hearted hand
* Refrain
When your dealing cards with death the joker’s wild the ace is high
Jack bet the Mississippi River running Elk raised him the sky
Jack saw him with the sun and room and upped him with the stars
Running Elk bet the Rocky Mountains Jupiter and Mars
The sun was sinking in the west when Jack draw the ace of spades
Running Elk just rolled his eyes and smiled and passed away
Jack picked up his turquoise stones and cast them to the sky
He stared into the setting sun and made the mournful cry
* Refrain

Why do you treat me as if I was only a friend
What have I done that has made you so different and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you’ll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you’ll say that you forever long to be mine
Think of the heartaches, the sorrows and tears you will save
When you are lonely and tired of another man’s gold
When you are weary, remember this letter, my own
Don’t try to answer though I’ll suffer anguish unknown
If you don’t love me I wish you would leave me alone
While I am writing this letter I think of our past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this old world, I’ll soon say my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

I’ve been traveling for Jesus so much of my life
Been traveling o’er land and on sea
But I’m planning on taking a trip to the sky
That will be the last move for me
   When I move to the sky up in heaven so high
   What a wonderful time that will be
   I’m ready to go washed in Calvary’s flow
   That will be the last move for me
I’ve seen wonderful sights as I travelled afar
How little, how empty they seem
When I make my last move to that city of gold
That will be the last move for me
Here I’m bothered with packing each time that I move
And carry a load in each hand
But I’ll not need one thing that I’ve used in this world
When I move to that heavenly land
Everything that I’ll need will be furnished up there
Not even my song books I’ll bring
Or the precious old Bible that showed me the way
I’ll not need when I stand by my King

Well that last train done left town
The last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
But that last train done left town. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Now my sweet baby’s on that train
My sweet baby’s on that train
I wonder if I will see her again
But that last train’s done gone down. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Now the whistle’s moaning low
The whistle is moaning low
I begged my baby please don’t go
But that last train’s done gone down. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Now I’m sorry for what I’ve done
I’m sorry for what I’ve done
To leave behind your baby crying
But that last train’s done gone down. Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
Well that last train done left town
The last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
But that last train done left town. Hoo-hooo-hooo-hoo-hoo.

Well it was good one time everything was mighty fine
The coal tipples roared day and night
But things they got slow for no reason that I know
And ill winds they hove into sight
The mines all closed down everybody laid around
There wasn’t very much that you could do
Except stand in that line to get your ration script on time
And woman I could see it killin’ you
Now the soft new snows of December
Lightly fall my cabin ’round
So that last train from Poor Valley
Takin’ brown haired Becky Richmond bound
It’s been a comin’ on I knew soon you would be gone
Leavin’ crossed your mind every day
Then you said to me things are bad at home you see
I guess I’d better be on my way
I should blame you now but I never could somehow
A miner’s wife you weren’t cut out to be
It wasn’t what you thought just some dreams Lord that you’d bought
When you left your home and ran away with me

Darling, clasp me to your bosom
As you did in days of yore
Lay your hand upon my forehead
Ere I reach the golden shore
Life is from me fastly falling
Soon I’ll be in sweet repose
When I’m gone 1 ask this favor
Lay my head beneath the rose
Darling, first you said you loved me
When you gave me hand and heart
There were roses on your cheeks, love
As we vowed we ne’er would part
One more kiss for I am going
Far beyond all earthly woe
May your life be like your cheeks, love
Covered with the blossomed rose
He has crossed the shadowed valley
Where the living waters flow
Love has answered all his pleading
And he sleeps in sweet repose
Beneath a grassy mound he’s resting
Where the golden sunset glows
Love has answered all his pleading
And he sleeps in sweet repose

All your money won’t help you get through the great gates of heaven
All your power cannot help you over there
If you find you’ve been living here for the almighty dollar
You’ll never have a mansion over there
   Just like the rich man who wouldn’t give a crumb from his table
   He found in the end from God he couldn’t run
   He found himself in the depths of hell looking up at poor Lazarus
   Crying just a drop of water to cool my tongue
There’s been many a man who’s had it all in this life
Thought he had it under control
In the end he found himself begging for God’s mercy
In the end he found he’d lost his soul
There is victory ahead for those who hear and listen
Who trust in God in spite of great despair
For Jesus is our shield and our great high tower
And he promised to deliver us with prayer
   Just like when Lazarus reached heaven and he looked down at the rich man
   Who had no hope when his race was run
   He stood down there in the depths of hell looking up at poor Lazarus
   Crying just a drop of water to cool my tongue

Work all week in the noon day sun
Fifteen cents when Saturday comes
Goin to a dance to have some fun
Why don’t you get away lazy John
    Lazy John lazy John
    Why don’t you get your day’s work all done
    You’re in the shade and I’m in the sun
    Why don’t you get away lazy John
My gal lives at the end of the road
Her eyes are crossed and her legs are bowed
But We sure have a lot of fun
Why don’t you get away lazy John
Goin to a dance Saturday night
Ain’t coming home til the bald daylight
Then I’ll take my girl back home
Why don’t you get away lazy John

The leaf of love is slowly falling
Like winter storms with rain and snow
You broke a heart in one short moment
The leaf of love is falling low
How could you go and leave me lonely
I have no one to call my own
The tree that bore my love for you dear
Has shed its leaves my love is gone
Stormy roads I’m traveling on now
Where I’ll end God only knows
A beaten rock along the river
It’s quiet and peaceful where it flows

What a fellowship, what a joy divine
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine
Leaning on the everlasting arms 
   Leaning, leaning
   Safe and secure from all alarms
   Leaning, leaning
   Leaning on the everlasting arms 
O how sweet to walk in the pilgrim way
Leaning on the everlasting arms
O how bright the path grows from day to day
Leaning on the everlasting arms 
What have I to dread, what have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Now I was a stranger in love and in town
You set me up then you put me down
You had your way with me every time
But leaving would take that load off my mind
   You wanted love and you wanted more
   People and places like never before
   You ran around like you thought I was blind
   But leaving would take that load off my mind
Now you had me fooled from the day that we met
Sweet lies you told me I’ll never forget
But you can’t keep lying and love and you’ll find
Cause leaving will take that load off my mind
Now don’t you be waiting for my knock on your door
That kind of loving I don’t need no more
You had your day until it came time
For leaving will take that load off my mind

Many times I’ve thought about you
Many times I’ve wondered why
That you’d ever go and leave me
And this heart you taught to cry
   Darling wait until I see you
   Since you say it is the end
   Though I know that you don’t love me
   Won’t you let me be your friend
As I lay upon my pillow
Thinking of you in my dreams
Are you happy with another
I’m so lonesome here it seems
Do you ever think about me
Will you love again someday
Will you ever think my darling
Of this heart you stole away

Lay your head on my shoulder
Put your little hand in mine
We’ll walk down lovers lane together
Let me love you one more time
    Tomorrow you’ll be with another
    Things just didn’t turn out right
    But to my grave I’ll carry with me
    A memory of your love tonight

Let me rest at the end of my journey
I’m weary, tired, and old
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
   Old paint is tired, his feet are all sore
   We’ll ride the range no more
   Let me rest at the end of my journey
   Heaven is my home and my goal
A cowboy’s life on the old Texas trail
Herding doggies is all that he knows
A cowboy’s life on the old cattle trail
Leads from Texas to old Mexico

In a church on Sunday morning
Sat a man unwelcome there
Judged by men and not by Jesus
He lifted up his voice in prayer
   Steer me on the righteous pathway
   Help me humbly to abide
   Hold me to your precious bosom
   Let me walk lord by your side
Several silent moments followed
It seemed that no one was in that room
Then a voice it roared like thunder
Look for me I’m coming soon
Such a change I’ve never witnessed
Tear filled eyes were plainly shown
Gathered there around that stranger
Saying God bless you welcome home

Are you waiting just for me
With your promise to be true
Always in your memory
Let me whisper I love you
As twilight gathers and stars seem to sigh
Down by the river I stroll
Thinking of you now the days have gone by
When you were my darlin’ my own
As I walk alone where we two used to stroll
Close by the clear waters flow
It seems that the soft rippling water I hear
Echoes these words soft and low
Let me whisper I love you

   Let the church roll on (oh my lord)
   Let the church roll on (oh my lord)
   Let the church roll on (oh my lord)
   Let the church roll on 
There’s a deacon in the church (oh my lord)
And he won’t do right (oh my lord)
What shall we do (oh my lord)
Turn him out and kick him out
And let the church roll on
There a drunkards in the church (oh my lord)
And he won’t do right (oh my lord)
What shall we do, take the liquor pour it out
And let the church roll on
There’s women in the church (oh my lord)
Got paint on their face (oh my lord)
What shall we do take some water and wash it off
And let the church roll on

We plowed this field with a red mule we would rake and we would hoe
Clear away the rocks and weeds plant the seeds and watch ’em grow
Tend the crops until they’d blossom see the corn yellow and tall
If the summer rains were kindly we’d have a harvest in the fall
You have been my true companion since the day our love was young
Darling stand beside me and watch the setting sun
If I die before you do one request I ask you please
Pray Jesus take my soul let the harvest go to seed
Oh I feel like that old mountain standin’ lonesome in the sky
Where the cries of the wolf hungy winds mournful sigh
High above our little cabin lay my bones there to rest
Where the wild birds and critters still make their little nests
Oh who will reap the harvest when it ripens on the vine
Who will tend the vineyard who will drink the new wine
Darlin’ please remember let the harvest go to seed
So the wild birds and critters will have enough to eat

Today I feel so sad and weary
I want a love that cannot be
All I need to make me happy
Let those brown eyes smile at me
Let those brown eyes smile at me dear
That’s what I wish with all my soul
Let those brown eyes smile at me dear
Turn my blue moon back to gold
Now we’ve been sweetheart so long darling
Now you’re growin’ tired of me
The last time that we were together
Those brown eyes didn’t smile at me
Flatt and Skruggs; And The Foggy Mountain Boys

Jack and May sweethearts were they
They were engaged to be wed
Many a promise he made her
Many a love word he said
As most lovers do they quarreled one night
She bid him not come any more
She gave him his hat
Jack started away
But he lingered to say at the door
‘Tis up these broken cords and let us be lovers again
Darling you know I love you to part would give me pain
Let us forget the past and make up my pet
Make up and be lovers again
Years rolled by neither was wed
All of Jack’s pleading was vain
One quiet evening poor Jack was found dead
Two lives have been wrecked for she loved oh too late
She goes to his grave every day
All through life in dismay
She can’t tell you why but it seems to her cry
The wind seems to whisper and say

Come on boys let’s go to the fair
See the funny sights and the cool night air
Grasshopper kissing the old black crow
Road hog red do the dose-ee-doe
More funny things than you ever did see
Ringtail coons monkeys in the trees
Pussy cat combing the tomcat’s hair
Come on boys let’s go to the fair
Had a banjo picking rooster the cockiest of ’em all
Strutted on the stage in his bib overalls
Close behind was old fiddling bear
Bluegrass music by a rooster and a bear
Old mother goose wore fancy clothes
High heeled slippers and fancy clothes
An old bare possum in his underwear
Killed himself a laughing at the county fair

Let’s live for tonight dear and try to be gay
Tomorrow we might be apart
Let’s live for tonight dear let love have it’s way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Let’s cast all our worries and heartaches a side
Forget what the future might hold
Let’s live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let’s live for tonight dear and try to pretend
That we will never be alone
No matter what happens this night will be ours
What tomorrow holds nobody ever knows
Let’s live for tonight dear and try to be gay
Tomorrow we might be apart
Let’s live for tonight dear let love have it’s way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts

Each night I dream of you sweet heart
I can’t see why we had to part
But there’s no reason now to stay
For I was only in your way
Oh how I long to see your face
Tho’ there’s someone in my place
Or just to hear your voice again
Darling why not part the best of friends
I played the game of love and lost
My broken heart has paid the cost
And now that I am free to go
Somehow sweet heart I miss you so
You say that you are happy now
I’ll try to forget the past some how
But if your new love turns you down
Remember me I’m still around

Let’s say goodbye like we said in a friendly kind of way
There’s something wrong your love is gone I’ve no reason now to stay
We live and love we meet and part then broken hearts must pay
Let’s say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
Your love sweetheart I won’t forget you’re always on my mind
You’re all the happiness I knew so thoughtful sweet and kind
For old times sake I’m asking you to think of me someday
Let’s say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
I wish you happiness sweetheart in everything you do
May good luck always come your way and every dream come true
I’ll remember you and the love we knew the love of yesterday
Let’s say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
If I should meet some other dear and learn to love them too
I hope and pray somehow sweetheart they’ll make me think of you
A tender smile an old love song a heart so light and gay
Let’s say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way

I can’t answer her letter
For she left me no address
You should know my little darling
You left my poor heart in distress
   I got a letter from my darling
   She said she hated to go
   It broke my heart the words she wrote me
   She closed by saying I love you so
She wrote the words she knew would hurt me
She said I never could be true
I’ve tried I’ve tried my little darling
To prove my love was just for you
This letter meant goodbye forever
Though we’ll have each other’s hearts
Our love will fade away in sadness
Precious one why did we have to part

I got your letter dear sweetheart
And darlin I miss you oh so much
Your letter has cheered my but I’m lonesome
Lonesome just to feel your lovin touch
   Letters never bring me the touch of your hand
   Or none of your sweet lovin charm
   I get so lonesome for you darlin
   And you know that letters have no arms
Letters have no arms dear to hold me
Kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letters
I want to be with you dear with

After traveling through this world of sorrow
No one on earth to call my friend
I’m on my way to old Kentucky
Where I met and loved but could not win
I’ve always loved you little darlin
My heart will always feel the same
I could never do one thing to hurt you
I’d rather die than bring you shame
When that cold dark shroud is wrapped around me
They lay my weary head to rest
Will you stand around and gaze upon me
For I’m the one that loved you best
When your golden hair is turned to silver
The master calls your soul to Him
Where we can be free from all our troubles
I’ll meet you there at journey’s end

It’s a long straight road and my engines a wheeling
I can’t help but think about a good night’s sleep
And the long long road and my life are a callin’ me
These rough old hands are glued to the wheel
Five foot of fence from the way that they feel
And the lights coming over the hill are a blinding me
   There’s rain on the road and I can see the load start to shiftin’
   Too late to see the post and I haven’ got a ghost of a chance
   The windshield wipers are beatin’ in time
   The song they sing is a part of my mind
   And I can’t believe this is really happening to me
God I’m over the edge and down the mountain side
I know they’ll tell about the night I died
Between the rain and the lights on the hill are a blindin’ me
It’s a long tough road from a way down south
A mans gotta find a little food for his mouth
And a home for a girl as sweet as honey can be
So it’s down through the gears shes a startin to pull
The gage on the tank is a showin’ full
The lights comin’ over the hill are a blindin’ me

It’s not that love is dead and gone
Or that you didn’t try
That weight so heavy on my mind
It’s the thought that you might mean it
When you call me on the phone
Just to tell me that you want me one more time
I won’t be standing at your door
I stood there once before
I’ve known your hello and your good-bye
So why am I shaking like a child in the rain
When you tell me that you want me one more time
When you tell me that you want me one more time
Don’t talk about the midnights
That come down like a stone
Can’t you see that I already know
And after all the morning sun
Will burn away the dark
But even if you’re there I’ll be around
* Refrain
There’s part of me that laughs
There’s part of me that cries
There’s part of me that can’t make up it’s mind
But living would be easier
If you never call at all
To tell me that you want me one more time
* Refrain

Look outside the rain it pours
The lightning flashes and the thunder roars
I wonder if you’d stand a better chance to try to tame the elements
Rather than try to tame my soul
To think your love could ever hold
To the likes of me to the likes of me
It aint that I wouldn’t like to stay
Live my life in an ordinary way
9 to 5 a family a little bitty boy upon my knee
Woman I’d only break your heart
But that kind of life just ain’t in the cards
For the likes of the me the likes of me
The likes of me that knows no home
Or the town I’m in or the road I’m on
I’m a restless soul and I’ll never be still
So I’ll follow the sunrise over the hill
I can see the designs of the picture in your mind
You think that you could change my life
That you’d make me a perfect wife
Woman you’re sweet you’re lovin’ and kind
So don’t mess up your pretty little mind
On the likes of me on the likes of me

In the state of West Virginia among the peaceful rolling hills
There I met a mountain maid with eyes of blue
Golden hair so soft and curly and her lips were like the dew
She was the queen of West Virginia and her name was Linda Lou
   Linda Lou my Linda Lou can’t you hear me calling you
   Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
   When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
   Can’t you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou
I recall the night I met her how I held her hand in mine
I recall the night we kissed and bid adieu
Many miles may separate us if I should cross the ocean blue
My heart is still in West Virginia with my darling Linda Lou

I’m looking out the window at the rain
The night is driving me crazy
It’s just as cold inside
All the warms is gone without my baby
And in my mind something stirs
And my lips start crying out your name
While I’m a-sitting here and wondering where you are
And listening to the rain
The beating on the window can’t compare with the beating
That I’m taking
The window’s gone cold but look at me
I’m already breaking
Memories tugging at my heart
And it’s gonna crack beneath the strain
While I’m sitting here wondering where you are
And listening the rain
My mind has got you pictured
In the arms and in the heart of some new love
I’ve tried to black it out
But all my mind can see is him and you love
Knowing that it might be true
That’s the thing that’s causing all the pain
While I’m sitting here wondering where you are
And listening to the rain

Once more I must leave you little Annie
We must part at the end of the lane
But you promised me little Annie
You’d be waiting when the springtime comes again
   When the springtime comes o’er the mountains
   And the wild flowers scatter o’er the plains
   I will watch for the leaves to return to the trees
   And I’ll be waiting when the springtime comes again
When the sun shines down on the mountains
And the wild sheep are wandering all alone
And the birds and the bees are singing
Then it makes me think that springtime won’t be long
Now the springtime has come on the mountains
And I’m on my way back to the lane
For you promised me little Annie
You’d be waiting when the springtime comes again

One night as the stars were all shining
Little Benny knelt down by his bed
He asked the dear Lord to forgive him
For all the bad words he had said
   Please papa don’t whip little Benny
   Please papa don’t whip little Ben
   He’s little and wants you to love him
   Please papa don’t whip little Ben
You remember how Mama loved Benny
How she kissed him the morning ahe died
She told him to love and obey you
And I know little Benny has tried
Oh what if dear Mama in Heaven
Should be looking way down from the sky
And see you whip little Benny
I know it would make Mama cry
Those very bad words that he said
He learned from some old wicked men
He’s little and didn’t know better
Please papa don’t whip little Ben

Hug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
For I am cold and tired, dear mother
And I feel so strange tonight
Something hurts me here, dear mother
Like a stone upon my breast
Oh I wonder, wonder mother
Why it is I cannot rest
All the day as you were working
And I lay upon my bed
I was trying to be patient
And to think of what you said
How the King, Blessed Jesus
Loves His lambs to watch and keep
Oh, I wish He would come and take m
In His arms that I might sleep
Just before the lamps were lighted
Just before the children came
While the room was very quiet
I heard someone call my name
All at once a window opened
On a field of lambs and sheep
Some far out were in a brook drinking
Some were lying fast asleep
In a moment I was looking
On a world so bright and fair
Which was filled with little children
And they seemed so happy there
They were singing oh so sweetly
Sweetest songs I ever heard
They were singing sweeter mother
Than our own little birds
But I could not see the Savior
Though I strained my eyes to see
And I wonder if He saw me
Would He speak to such as me
All at once a window opened
One so bright upon me smiled
And I knew it must be Jesus
When He said come here, my child
Come up here, little Bessie
Come up here and live with me
Where little children never suffer
Suffer through eternity
Then I thought of all you told me
Of that bright and happy land
I was going when you called me
When you came and kissed my hand
And at first I felt so sorry
You had called, I would go
Oh, to sleep and never suffer
Mother, don’t be crying so 
Hug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
Oh how much I love you mother
And how strong I feel tonight
And her mother pressed her closer
To her own dear burdened breast
On the heart so near it’s breaking
Lay the heart so near it’s rest
At the solemn hour of midnight
In the darkness calm and deep
Laying on her mother’s bosom
Little Bessie fell asleep

   Little birdie, little birdie
   Come and sing me you song
   Got a short time to stay here
   And a long time to be gone
I’m a long way from old Dixie
And my old Kentucky home
Now my parents are both dead and gone
Have no place to call my home
Now I’d rather be a sailor
Way out upon the sea
Then to be at home a marred man
With a baby on my knee
For the married man he sees trouble
And the single boy sees none
I expect to live single
Til my days on earth are done
Now I’d rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don’t ever shine
Then to see you love another
When you promised to be mine

When I was a little boy I had no time
No time for ceremonies
All I wanted was to see the world
from the back of a little black pony
From the back of a little black pony.
Mr. Lee lived across the street
had a daughter my age named Joanie
In the summertime we’d build us a boat
We’d sail to the island Coney
We’d sail to the island Coney
There used to be a medicine man come around
everybody called him a phony
But I thought he was a king when I heard him ring
A big bell on the little black pony
He was riding on a little black pony.
I said oh mister what can I give you
I haven’t got much money
But I’ll do anything even try to sing
if you’ll let me have that pony
I gotta have that little black pony.
He said son learn to play the banjo
All the old tunes happy and lonely
And I’ll be back this way someday
And you can have that pony
you can have that little black pony.
Well the old man he never came back
But I never once thought he was a phony
I just guess he must have realized
he couldn’t do without that pony
He couldn’t live without that little black pony.
Mr. Lee moved away and got a job in the city
That’s the last I saw of Joanie
But I can’t forget the cardboard boats
and I still love little black ponies
I still love little black ponies.

   There’s a little black train a comin
   Set your business right
   There’s a little black train a comin
   And it may be here tonight
   Go tell that ball room lady
   All dressed in the worldly pride
   That death’s dark train is coming
   Prepare to take a ride
God sent to Hezikai
A message from on high
You better set your house in order
For you must surely die
He turned to the wall in weeping
We see and hear his tears
He got his business fixed all right
God spared him fifteen years
We see that train with engine
And one small baggage car
Your idle thoughts and wicked deeds
Will stop at the judgment bar
That poor young man in darkness
Cares not for the gospel light
Til suddenly he hears the whistle blow
And the little black train in site
Have mercy on me lord
Please come and set me right
Before he got his business fixed
The train rolled in that night

Tonight I’m alone without you my dear
It seems there’s a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
   Oh, someone has taken you from me
   And left me here all alone
   Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
   In our little cabin home on the hill
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there’s a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won’t be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there’s no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill

I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been there for many a day
In that little community church yard I heard the gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
    Oh I knelt down and prayed to my Savior
    That He might hear and would accept me
    Then I felt the Holy Spirit
    I knew my soul was saved in me 
In that little community church house that’s where we sing and pray
We pray to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life’s long journey we’ll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher saying ‘amen’
And a vision there before me it was my Savior’s face
I knew that I was saved by Grace

Little country preacher with his head bowed down in prayer
I know that he’s in conference with our Load away up there
He’s not hightened with his speech just plain like you and me
He reminds me of the prophets and the man of Galilee
He started out when just a lad to preach the gospel way
And when the path got hard to trod with mother he would stay
The money did not bother him for Christ he took his stand
His pay day will be paid to him at the gates of Glory Land
The little church he preaches at each Sunday for our aske
If you pass it by and don’t go in you’ve made a big mistake
His good old fashioned voice pleads stranger enter in
God’s pleading through good men to save us from our sins

In the night while you lay sleeping
Dreaming of your amber skies
Was a poor boy broken-hearted
Listening to the winds that sigh
My little darlin’ oh how I love you
How I love you none can tell
In your heart you love another
Little darlin’ pal of mine
Many a day with you I’ve rambled
Happiest hours with you I’ve spent
Thought I had your heart forever
Now I find it’s only lent
There is just three things I wish for
That’s my casket shroud and grave
When I’m dead don’t weep for me
Just kiss those lips that you betrayed

Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true
   Way down in the blue ridge mountains
   Way down where the tall pines grow
   Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
   She’s my little Georgia rose
Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn’t stand
We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart

Our darling wandered far away while she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn’t hear a sound
She was our darling girl the sweetest thing in all the world
We searched for her but she couldn’t be found
   I heard the screams of out little girl far away
   Hurry Daddy there’s and awful dreadful snake
   I ran as fast as I could through the dark and dreary woods
   But I reached our darling girl too late
Oh I began to cry I knew that soon she’d have to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake
It’s getting dark tell mommy goodbye
To all parents I must say don’t let your children stray away
They need your love to guide them along
Oh God I pray we’ll see our darling girl some day
It seems we still can hear her voice around our home

Oh, a long long time ago when I left my home to roam
Down in the hills of Tennessee
Was the sweetest little girl that was ever in this world
Down in the hills of Tennessee
   Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
   I know she’s waiting there for me
   Someday I’ll settle down in that little country town
   With that little girl of mine in Tennessee
Oh, she begged me not to go “You’ll be sorry dear I know”
For the way that you’ve been treating me
So I rambled all around but nothing could be found
To take the place of her in Tennessee
Oh, someday I’ll wander back to that little mountain shack
The little girl that’s waiting there for me
I can see her smiling face waiting for me at the gate
The little girl of mine in Tennessee

Many years have passed away and gone
Since I left my old native home
Since I left the scenes of my childhood there
Where the dark days seem to roam
I left my aged father there
And my mother so dear unto me
I left a brother and a sister fair
And a little girl that played upon my knee
Don’t Ginny remember, will she ever forget
Those many hours of pleasure to me
Does she sigh when she thinks of those many happy hours
When a little girl she played upon my knee
I am homeward bound with the thrills of joy
Of my wandering so far o’er the sea
I shall soon see my home, my old native home
And the little girl that played upon my knee
I am tired of life, I cannot live
In this dark world so weary unto me
Come bury me low by the one I love so well
By the little girl that played upon my knee

Come little girl let’s go get married
My love is so great, how can you slight me
I’ll work for you both late and early
At my wedding my little wife you’ll be
Oh Willie dear, let’s both consider
We’re both too young to be married now
When we’re married, we’re bound together
Let’s stay single just one more year
He went to the bar where she was dancing
A jealous thought came to his mind
I’ll kill that girl, my own true lover
Before I let another man beat my time
He went to the bar and called her to him
She said Willie dear, what you want with me
Come and drink wine with the one that loves you
More than anyone else you know, said he
While they were at the bar a-drinking
That same old thought came to his mind
He’d kill that girl, his own true lover
He gave her poison in a glass of wine
She laid her head over on his shoulder
Said Willie dear, please take me home
That glass of wine that I’ve just drinken
Has gone to my head and got me drunk
He laid his head over on the pillow
Let me read you the law let me tell you my mind
Molly dear, I’m sorry to tell you
We both drank poison in a glass of wine
They folded their arms around each other
They cast their eyes unto the sky
Oh God, oh God, Ain’t this a pity
That the both true lovers are bound to die

My father, he’s the king of the gypsies, it is true
My mother, she learned me some camping for to do
With my pack all on my back my friends all wished me well
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
As I was a-walking upon a London street
A handsome young squire was the first I chanced to meet
He view-ed my brown cheeks and he liked them so well
He said, “My little gypsy girl, will you my fortune tell?”
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
Oh yes sir, oh kind sir, please give to me your hand
It’s you that have fine fortune, both houses and good land
The fairer girls are dainty, but you must cast them by
For it is the little gypsy girl who is to be your bride
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
He took me to his castle, there were carpets on the floor
And servants there a-awaiting for to open every door
There were ladies there of honor and the music it did play
And all were there to celebrate the gypsy’s wedding day
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell
So it’s farewell to the gypsy life, to camping on the green
No more with my brothers and my sisters I’ll be seen
Oh, once I was a gypsy girl but now I’m a squire’s bride
With servants for to wait on me and in my carriage ride
Some fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell
As I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell

I am always dreaming of my little home
Back among the hills of Tennessee
I am always yearning, longing to return
To the place that means the world to me 
Just a little shack roof all turning black
Still it’s a place there to me
Song birds always singing round the kitchen door
Of my little home in Tennessee 
I can see my mother standing by the gate
As I drove the old horse up the lane
She would never scold me when I came home late
How I wish that I had never cause her pain 
Just a tender smile beaming all the while
No one could be half so kind to me
Now she’s gone to Heaven and she’ll never return
To my little home in Tennessee 
I can still remember many years ago
When my sweetheart wandered by my side
Down among the mountains where wild flowers grow
There she promised she would be my bride 
Then another man won her heart and hand
She always meant the world to me
I was broken hearted and I went away
From my little home in Tennessee

What will the birds do, mother, in the spring
Will they gather the crumbs around our door
Will they fly from the nest to the top of the tree
And ask why Joe wanders out no more
What will the kitten do, mother, all alone
Will she stray from her frolic for a day
Will she lie on the rug beside my bed
Like she did before I went away
What will Thomas, the old gardener do
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
The fairest one that lies around the tree
I saw the tears coming to his honest eyes
He said it was the wind that brought ’em there
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day
His hand trembled over my hair
Keep Tag, mother, my little dog
I know that he’ll mourn for me too
Keep him though blind and older he grows
To sleep in the whole summer through
Show him my coat, mother, so he may know
That his master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
And pat him on his brown shaggy head
And you, dearest mother, shall miss me for a while
But in heaven I shall no larger grow
And any kind angel you meet at the gate
Can take you to your darling Little Joe

There’s a house in Baltimore
Sixteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was full of chicken pie
Oh Liza poor girl
Oh Liza Jane
Oh Liza poor girl
She died on the train
I went up on the mountain
To give my horn a blow
And every girl in the countryside
Said yonder comes my beau
When I was a little boy
I liked to go in swimming
Now I am a bigger boy
I like to go with women
I wish I had a candy box
To put my sweetheart in
I’d take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again
One day I set a-courting
A girl as dear as life
When a woman she said to me
Mr.Jones
how is your wife

There is a precious volume of pages worn and old
In that little log cabin by the sea
It is the old old bible more precious now than gold
It’s the bible that my mother gave to me
   Tis the old precious bible blessed bible
   That she read in the cabin by the sea (by the sea)
   The precious precious bible the blessed blessed bible
   The bible that my mother gave to me
How often I have listened to the countless town and raves (?)
Round that little log cabin by the sea
While mother read of Jesus who walked upon the waves
How Jesus calmed the stormy Gallilee
How often oh how often she read of glowing mirth
With a message from the precious word above
It told of faithful Daniel who trusted in the Lord
While it lead me in the pathway that she brought (?)
There is no other volume so precious as this book
It tells me how to live and how to die
It tells me of that city oh wondrous wondrous look
And that I’ll meet my loved ones by and by

Mamma says she don’t want me because I’m getting old
Fears that I might freeze to death the weather is so cold
If I live tonight I think I will try
When the moon goes down tonight I’m a gonna say goodbye 
   I’m goin from the cotton fields
   I’m goin from the cane
   I’m goin from that little log hut
   That stands down in the lane 
Now I’m old and feeble and I cannot see my way
Mamma says I’m old and gray and only in the way
I’m leaving the little log hut the place I love to dwell
When the stars shine bright tonight I’m a gonna bid farewell

Oh yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hands
She’s drinking away her troubles
She’s a courting some other man
Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
A shining in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky
Last time a saw little Maggie
She was sitting on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four around her
And a banjo on her knee
Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain
Little Maggie’s gonna dance for daddy
Listen to that old banjo ring
Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty women were made for loving
Little Maggie was made for mine

Away by the waters so blue
The ladies were winding their way
While Pharaoh’s little daughter went down to the water
To bathe in the cool of the day
Before it was dark she opened the ark
And found the sweet babe that was there
And away by the waters so blue
The infant was lonely and sad
She took him in pity and thought him so pretty
And it made little Moses so glad
She called him her own, her beautiful son
And she sent for a nurse who was near
And away by the waters so blue
They carried that beautiful child
To his tender mother, to his sister and brothers
Little Moses looked happy and smiled
His mother so good did all that she could
To raise him and teach him with care
And away by the sea that was red
Little Moses the servant of God
While in him confided, the sea was divided
As upwards he lifted his rod
And the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh’s host
Was drownded in the waters and lost
And away on a mountain so high
The last that he ever did see
With Israel victorious, his hopes were most glorious
That soon all the Jordan be free
When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens above

There’s a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
There and old fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
For what few coins the congregation could afford
Dressed in all out Sunday best we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
And when the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.
   Looking back now that little mountain church house
   Has become my life’s corner stone
   It was there in that little mountain church house
   I first heard the word I’ve based my life upon.
At the all day Sunday singing and dinner on the ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While my brothers and my sisters who’ve gone on to glory land
Slept in piece in the maple grove nearby

Oh I’m gettin’ old and feeble and I cannot work no more
The children no more gather ’round my door
And old masters and old mrs they are sleepin’ side by side
Near the little old log cabin in the lane
    Oh the chimney’s fallen down and the roof’s all caved in
   Lettin’ in the sunshine and the rain
   And the only friend I’ve got now is that good old dag of mine
   And the little old log cabin in the lane
Oh the trees have all growed up that lead around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way
Oh I ain’t got long to stay here what little time I’ve got
I want to rest content wile I remain
‘Til death shall call this dog and me to find a better home
And a little old log cabin in the lane

Now kind friends I want to tell you
Of a little country home
It is made of poplar logs upon the hill
That’s where poppa died and left us
When we were very young
And momma kept us settled on he hill
   When our days work on the farm was done
   She’d would gather us around
   She would have us get down on our little knees
   She would pray for God to keep us
   Through the night until next
   In our little old poplar log house on the hill
Our father died a good man
Which we all would like to do
And I’m going there to see him some old day
When I’m get through with my singing
Lay my guitar by my side
Lord I want to play in heaven when I die

There’s a little rosewood casket
Resting on a marble stand
With a packet of old love letters   
Written by my true love’s hand
Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o’er for me tonight
I have often tried but could not   
For the tears that filled my eyes
When I’m dead and in my casket
When I gently fall asleep      
Fall asleep to wake in heaven      
Dearest sister do not weep
            
Take his letters and his locket
Place them gently on my heart         
But this golden ring that he gave me      
From my finger never part

I went out one night for to make a little round
I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home got into bed
A forty-four pistol under my head
I wake up the next morning about half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standing in line
Gents and camper are standing around
Carrying little Sadie to her burying ground
Well I began to think of what a deed I’d done
I grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho
I was standing on the corner reading the bill
When up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
Said young man is your name Brown
Remember the night you shot Sadie down
Well I said yes sir but my name is Lee
And I shot little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree
If you got any papers won’t you read them to me
They took me down town and dressed me in black
And they put me on a train and started me back
All the way back to that Thomasville jail
And I had no money for to go my bail
Well the judge and the jury took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days and forty-one nights
Forty -one years to wear the ball and stripes

Under my bed you can set your little satchel
And on my head come lay your little hand
If you will be my own true lover
And I will be your loving little man
Run to the house and ask your papa
A bride of mine you’ll ever be
If he says no come back and tell me
And I’ll wait till you get free
When you get free well then we’ll get married
Look how happy we will be
Oh we’ll go to California
Any place you want to go
oh we’ll go to Louisiana
Settle down and live at home
I wish I was a little angel
And over these prison walls I would fly
Fly on back to the arms of my darling
Stay at home and there I would die
As you can see I’m no little angel
Neither have I wings to fly
I’ll go back all broken hearted
Weep and moan until I die
Under my bed you can set your little satchel
And on my head come lay your little hand
If you will be my own true lover
And I will be your loving little man

There’s a little white church in the valley
That stands in my memory each day
And it seems I can hear the bells now ringing
Though I am many miles away
And many times in church on Sunday morning
That whole countryside would gather there
They would all kneel down by the altar
As they lifted up their voice in prayer
   Oh the church in the valley that little white church
   Is the place I love so well
   Now I’m sad and lonely yes I’m sad and lonely
   For that little white church in the dell
They would sing the old song Rock of Ages
Oh Christ let me hide myself in thee
And I know some of them are now waiting
Just o’er the dark and stormy sea
I know that troubles all are ended
And happy forever they will be
They are waiting and watching up yonder
For the coming home of you and me

Where the Mississippi flowing on the sunny southern shores
And the steamboat comes a-puffing round the bend
There’s a little old log cabin with a grape vine over the door
And a little white-washed chimney at the end
   Oh, I’m going back, yes, going back to the place I love so well
   To the folks who’ll want me all their own again
   In the little old log cabin with the grape vine o’er the door
   And a little white-washed chimney at the end
Oh, I went away up North where they told me I would find
Money hanging around like apples on a tree
But it was as my sweetheart told me there was nothing of the kind
And the weather was so cold I thought I’d freeze
I can see the smoke a-rising from the little chimney top
As it welcomes me and greets me on the breeze
Then I will start a-running and I know I’ll never stop
Till I’ve landed in that cabin on my knees

I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been for many a day
In that little community church house I heard that gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
   Oh I kneeled down and prayed to my Savior
   That He might hear and would accept me
   And then I felt the holy spirit
   I knew my soul was saved in me
In that little community church house that’s where we sang and prayed
We prayed to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life’s long journey we’ll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher said amen
And the vision there before me it was my Savior’s face
I knew that I was saved by grace

They tell me that you’re going away
What makes you want to leave
You gave me your love
You gave me your vow
And you’re leaving me here to grieve
   Live and let live, don’t break my heart
   Don’t leave me here to cry
   I never could live if we should part
   Tell me you don’t mean good-bye
Stayed awake last night and I walked the floor
What makes you treat me so
Live and let live, don’t break my heart
I don’t want to live if you go
You’re the one who made me love you so
You’re the one who’s making my cry
You’re the one who’d break me heart if you go
Tell me you don’t mean good-bye

There came a man from Tennessee
I must tell the story
He built a house beside the road And called it Loafer’s Glory
Get away, get away, get away I say
Don’t trade at Loafer’s Glory
He cheated me of house and land
At trading he was able
He kept a dog to lick the pots
And a goat to clear the table
His wife Jan had one left hand
She was mighty savvy
She hoed her taters every day
And wormed her rows of cabbage
His brooding hen had ceased to lay
He thought he would help her
He ran her backwards up the hill
And fed her corn and pepper

I’m growing old and feeble and I can’t work on more
My rusty bladed hoe I’ve laid to rest
My mama and my papa they are sleeping side by side
And their spirits now are roaming with the blessed
   Oh, the chimney’s falling down and the roof is all caved in
   Letting in the sunshine and the rain
   And the only friend I’ve got now is that good old dog of mine
   And that little old log cabin in the lane
Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way
Oh I ain’t got long to stay here, what little time I’ve got
I want to rest content while I remain
‘Til death shall call this dog and me to find a better home
Than that little old log cabin in the lane

I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb
When In a low whisper I heard someone say
How sweetly I sleep here alone
The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes
The cause of my master compels me from home
No kindred or relatives nigh
I met the contingent and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high
Go tell my companions and children most dear
To weep not for me while I’m gone
The same hand that led me through storms most severe
Has kindly assisted me on

   Lonely moon lonely moon won’t you shine in this cell
   And tell me that she’s doing well
   Lonely moon won’t you tell her I want her for mine
   But don’t push her she has her own mind.
As we gaze and admire the same shining stars
Though our distances are far
We can both watch the moon go down o’er the land
As if we were hand in hand.
Souls can be together while bodies are alone
Love can melt bars and climb walls of stone
We can both watch the moon go down o’er the land
As if we were hand in hand.

Lonely quit knockin’ on my door
Sadness don’t follow me around
You’re always by my side
Watchin’ every tear I’ve cried
Lonely quit knockin’ on my door
The picture that I’m lookin’ at right now
Is not the one she painted when we met
All I thought I had is gone
And I’m needin’ to move on
But a reason to just hasn’t hit me yet
My world blacked out the moment that she left
She slammed the door and didn’t say a word
Add them all up into one
Thunder lightning and big guns
And that’s still the loudest sound I ever heard
A man trapped behind a cell room wall
His time’s for life and nothin’ left to fear
He’s under lock and key and he’s just the same as me
But a different kind of sentence put me here

I was strolling one day in a lonely graveyard
When a voice from the tomb seemed to say
I once lived as you lived walked and talked as you talk
But from earth I was soon called away
   Oh those tombs (oh those tombs) lonely tombs (lonely tombs)
   Seemed to say in a low gentle tone
   Oh how sweet (oh how sweet) is the rest (is the rest)
   In our beautiful Heavenly home 
Every voice from the tomb seemed to whisper and say
Living man you must soon follow me
And I thought as I looked on those cold marble slabs
What a dark lonely place that must be 
Then I came to the place where my mother was laid
And in silence I stood by her tomb
And her voice seemed to say in a low gentle tone
I am safe with my Savior at home

Lonesome
For the arms that held me tight
Lonesome
For the lips that whispered goodnight
    I pretend to be happy
    But my friends know
    Lonesome
    Don’t matter where I go
Lonesome
Living in the past
Lonesome
For the love that didn’t last
    Like a man lost at sea
    No place to land
    Lonesome
    For someone to understand
Lonesome
Lonesome

Lonesome blue heartbroken
As here I sit alone
My sweetheart’s gone and left me
Now everything’s gone wrong
Her hair was dark and curly
And hung way down behind
But now she loves another
I’m run-ning on the vine
I ne-ver rode a boxcar
Until she turned me down
I’ll never love no other
I’ll never settle down
On down this lonesome railroad
My back to the old hometown
My past will always haunt me
And the girl who turned me down

I got the lonesome blues tonight
Won’t you stay here dear friend that’s what I need
Someone to hold me tight well it’s all right
I got the lonesome blues tonight
I got the homely blues tonight
May be got some time to lend I’ll try to be
The one you miss tonight make you feel all right
I got the homely blues tonight
I got the cold cold blues tonight
Won’t you try to understand if I can be
With someone else tonight when you dim the light
I got the cold cold blues tonight

Have you ever stood in a lonesome depot
and told someone goodbye
you’d give anything in all this world
if she’d only break down and cry
Forget the pain and bear your shame
And beg her not to go
For when she’s gone there’s misery
And the loneliness will grow and grow
Oh how many years did she stand by you
And lay awake at night
Crying and prayin for you to come home
You know now you’re weepin her right

Now I know what it means to be lonesome
And I know what it means to be blue
And I know what it means to be lonesome in dreams
When there’ someone missing you
Cause I’ve cried and I’ve cried since we parted
There’s no one knows what I’ve gone through
I’d give all that I own just to have you back home
Cause I’m lonesome lonesome for you
My best friend left me this morning
As the clock was striking four
And the smiling face of my darling
I may not see no more
Now I know what it means to be worried
To be all lonesome and blue
For the one that I loved so dearly
Has turned her back on me
Oh my mind is full of sorrow
And my heart is filled with pain
And I feel so broken hearted
Wont you please come back again
Cause I’ve cried and I’ve cried since we parted
There’s no one knows what I’ve gone through
I’d give all that I own just to have you back home
Cause I’m lonesome lonesome for you

I am lonesome for you darling
Though from me you’re far away
In a lonely little cottage
I am waiting day by day
Though you went away and left me
Left me alone in this old world
How it hurt me little darling
To hear you say those parting words
I can see you in the moonlight
Strolling down lover’s lane
I know it’s you I love my darling
Wont you take me back again
Do you think we could be happy
Do you think we could be true
To the one that’s always loved you
No one loves you like I do
Wont you take me back my darling
So I can prove my love to you
If you’ll accept me little darling
We will start our lives anew
I will take you back my darling
If you promise to be true
Let me look my little darling
In your loving eyes of blue
We are happy now together
In the moonlight all alone
And we’ll settle down forever
In our little cottage home

It’s cold outside the wind is blowing
And the snow is falling down
Now I’m so lonesome here without you
While you’re somewhere running around
You done me wrong my little darling
Leaving me here this way
Some day I know I’ll find you
When I do I’ll make you pay
Some times at night I dream about you
Wondering why you went away
You’re out there some where with another
And I’m gonna find you some day

I’ve got the lonesome homesick blues
I’ve got them bad babe down in my shoes
I left someone there that I might lose
That’s why I’ve got these old homesick blues
It makes me homesick to hear your name
And hold you dear in my arms again
I’m a gonna ride that old lonesome train
To the one I left back in Maces Spring
You told me once dear you loved me so
And it’s on my mind dear every where I go
I’ll soon be knowing if it is so
Or has your love for me grown cold
Oh listen to that old lonesome train
It’s a gonna carry me back again
To the one that told me their love was true
I’ll spend the rest of my days with you
I’ve been away babe a long long time
Now I’m riding down this old railroad line
And the one I love there I hope to find
To ease this lonesome blue heart of mine

In the pale moonlight we quarreled one night
Our heart’s were young and free
I left her there and on that night
I though she was two-timing me
   On a lonesome night so far from home
   I heard a mournful sound
   The girl I love is calling me
   She thinks I turned her down
She begged me not to leave her there
She swore that she’d been true
But a jealous heart cannot believe
Oh how I long for you

Last night I laid down everything was so fine
Had mother and dad so much on my mind
Thinking of home and the ones I love so
Everything was so great around the old home
   Then I woke up I was a dreaming
   No mother no dad no children a playing
   Everything was so quiet everybody was gone
   There was nothing left but a lonesome old home
Then I got up the sun was so bright
I looked all around but something’s not right
I walked out the door and there on a hill
Stood two lonesome graves Lord it gave me a chill
As I stood there everything was so still
As I started to leave those lonesome old hills
Leaving behind where I used to roam
Momma and dad and a lonesome old home

I’ve got the lonesome old homesick blues
I’ve got ’em bad babe down in my shoes
I left someone there that I might lose
That’s why I’ve got these old homesick blues.
It makes me homesick to hear your name
To want you near in my arms again
I’m gonna ride in your lonesome train
To the one I left back in Mason Springs
I’ve been away for a long long time
I’m riding down this old railroad line
To the one I left in that home of mine
this lonesome blue heart of mine.
You told me once dear you loved me so
And it’s on my mind now everywhere I go
I’ll soon be knowing if this is so
Or has your love for me gone cold

I set here in shame while the records are playing
The blues hang around me no need to go home
I keep on a drinking and wondering about her
That lonesome old song reminds me she’s gone
That lonesome old song keeps on a playing
And telling a story that makes me so blue
How the girl that I love has gone on and left me
That lonesome old song reminds me of you
I know I’m a fool to still care about her
She’s been unfaithful unkind and untrue
But all that she’s done right now don’t matter
That lonesome old song reminds me we’re thru
I know some day I’ll get over losing
She’s the only girl I could ever call mine
Since she’s gone away my life ain’t worth living
For a lonesome old song and a bottle of wine

I’m lonesome pine on the mountain
All alone I find no one by my side
Oh I wish I had me a dogwood tree
That would bloom beside me for company
I’m lonesome so lonesome I’ll never know why
I must stand all alone till the day that die
I’ll never get over this sorrow of mine
This evergreen sorrow from the lonesome pine
In the summertime when the wind blows free
There’s a mournful song in the heart of me
It’s the saddest song that you’ll ever hear
For the lonesome pine will you shed a tear
In the wintertime when the snow falls down
And my branches drop till they touch the ground
You can hear me groan with the load I bear
For its mine all alone no one seems to care

I was walking out this morning with rambling on my mind
I am going to catch that special train for lonesome pine
You can hear the whistle blowing as she’s coming down the line
That’s the train I catch this morning just to ease my troubling mind
   Yodel
   Take me back to Texas back to my old home
Oh I’m weeping like a willow and I’m mourning like a dove
There’s a girl out in Texas that I know I really love
Oh I’m going back to Texas where the lonesome coyotes whine
Where the longhorn cattle are lowing round that cabin home of mine
Oh give me back my rifle oh give me back my gun
Give me back my home in Texas and my rambling days are done

THERE’S A PATH BACK IN THE MOUNTAINS
THAT ONE ROOM HOUSE WHERE I WAS BORN
EVEN NOW THE MEMORIES LINGER
MY MAMA’S SMILE SO SOFT AND WARM
   LONESOME PINE I CAN HEAR YOU CALLIN’
   CALLIN’ ME BACK TO MY HOME
   WHERE THE FOX AND HOUND THROUGH THE HILLS ARE ROAMIN’
   LONESOME PINE CALLIN’ ME BACK HOME
IT’S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I LEFT THAT CABIN
IN SEARCH OF WEALTH FORTUNE AND FAME
AND LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I’M ALONE AND LONELY
I STILL HEAR MY DADDY CALL MY NAME
SOMEDAY SOON I’M A GONNA TRAVEL
BACK TO THE LAND THAT I LOVE BEST
IN THE STILLNESS OF THE MOUNTAINS
I WILL FIND SWEET PEACE AND REST

I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows the water rolls high
I hear a voice calling out there in the darkness
I sit here alone too lonesome to cry
   Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
   I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
   The woman I love she left me this morning
   With no one to love or kiss me goodnight
We met there one night by the banks of the river
Sat there holding hands and making our vows
Swore we’d never part and be happy together
But a new love she’s found she’s gone from me now

   I’m going down this road feeling bad
   I’m going down this road feeling bad
   I’m going down this road feeling bad, lord, lord
   And I ain’t a-gonna be treated this a-way
I’m down in the jailhouse on my knees
Down in the jailhouse on my knees
Down in the jailhouse on my knees, lord, lord
And I ain’t a-gonna be treated this a-way
They feed me on corn bread and beans
They feed me on corn bread and beans
They feed me on corn bread and beans, lord, lord
And I ain’t a-gonna be treated this a-way
Got two dollar shoes on my feet
Got two dollar shoes on my feet
Two dollar shoes they hurt my feet, lord, lord
And I ain’t a-gonna be treated this a-way
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot, Great God
And I ain’t a-gonna be treated this a-way
I’m going where the weather fits my clothes
I’m going where the weather fits my clothes
I’m going where the weather fits my clothes, lord lord
And I ain’t a-gonna be treated this a-way

There’s a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you’ll pay
Is a heart full of tears
Going down to lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
Going down to lonesome town
To cry my troubles away
In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forget

I leave Pittsburgh with a load of steel
Nobody knows just how I feel
With the road up ahead and my baby behind
Keep me drivin’ with a worried mind
 Lonesome Truck Driver Blues
Lonesome Truck Driver Blues
With the road up ahead and my baby behind
Keep me drivin’ with a worried mind
Lonesome truck driver blues
If you load too light you can’t make a dime
If you load to heavy then you get a fine
Look at ’em lined up down the road
Guess I’d better dump my load
Well it’s coffee cakes and pork and beans
Black eyed peas and turnip greens
Turn on my radio one time more
Hear Ernest Tubb a walkin’ the floor
Oh the motor’s purrin’ I’m makin’ time
Takin’ me back to that baby of mine
She’ll be purrin’ like a kitten when I walk in the door
The truck driver blues I won’t sing anymore

Everybody’s got to walk this lonesome valley
We’ve got to walk it by ourselves
There’s nobody else can walk it for us
We’ve got to walk it by ourselves
My father’s got to walk this lonesome valley
He’s got to walk it by himself
There’s nobody here can walk it for him
He’s got to walk it by himself
My mother’s got to walk this lonesome valley
Most sinners got to walk this lonesome valley
Everybody’s got to walk this lonesome valley

I am feeling mighty weary
And my heart is sad and blue
There is no one here to cheer me
And I’m lonesome without you
   Don’t forget your little promise
   When you told me you’d be true
   That you’d never love another
   Never leave me feeling blue
I will dream when I am sleeping
For I long to see your face
I will dream that you are near me
By my side to take your place

When we were young we loved each other
More than anyone will know
But today you found a new love
And you said I had to go
   Oh the road is rough and rocky
   Since the day I last saw you
   Another’s won your heart forever
   And I’m lonesome without you
On down this lonely road I wandered
With nothing left for me to do
Wondering if I’ll ever see you
And share the love that we once knew
My hope is now that you’ll be happy
With the new love you have found
But if you ever change your mind dear
Remember me I’ll be around

Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
   She walks these hills in a long black veil
   She visits my grave while the night winds wail
   Nobody knows, nobody sees
   Nobody knows but me
The judge said Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don’t have to die
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I’d been in the arms of my best friend’s wife
The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

   Long gone is how I’m leaving
   Long gone why do you cry
   This is what you wanted baby
   So I’m gone long gone
I have tried to make you happy
still you say I’ve done you wrong
so I’m giving up my darlin
I’ll be gone long gone
Just a few short words of parting
don’t shed no tears they won’t atone
for my things are packed to travel
I’ll be gone long gone
Please don’t try to overtake me
what I reid will be too fast
this is it I’m free forever
I’m long gone & free at last

   Long gone is how I’m leaving
   Long gone, why do you cry
   This is what you wanted baby
   So I’m gone, long gone
I have tried to make you happy
Still you say I’ve done you wrong
Oh I’m giving up my darling
So I’m gone, long gone
Please don’t try to overtake me
What I ride will be too fast
This is it, we’re through forever
I’m gone, I’m free at last
Please don’t shed no tears at parting
For your tears will not atone
After all the pain you cause me
I’m gone, long gone

   Lost all my money but a two dollar bill
   Two dollar bill boys, two dollar bill
   Lost all my money but a two dollar bill
   I’m on my long journey home
Cloudy in the West and it looks like rain
Looks like rain, boys, looks like rain
Cloudy in the West and it looks like rain
I’m on my long journey home
It’s dark and a raining and I want to go home
Want to go home, boys, want to go home
Its dark and a raining and I want to go home
I’m on my long journey home
Homesick and lonesome and I’m feeling kind of blue
Feeling kind of blue, boys, feeling kind of blue
Homesick and lonesome and I’m feeling kind of blue
I’m on my long journey home
There’s black smoke a rising and it surely is a train
Surely is a train boys, surely is a train
There’s black smoke a rising and it surely is a train
I’m on my long journey home

I always thought I’d like to roam
One day I started alone
Out in this old wide wicked world
Away from friends and home
    It’s a long long road to travel alone
    And when the day is gone
    No place to pillow my head at night
    Only on the cold cold stone
 
I’ve travelled around from town to town
Now it’s time that I settled down
I’ve had my fill of rambling around
And now I am homeward bound
 
One day a letter came to me
And this is what it read
Come home my boy to the old homestead
Your father and mother are dead
It’s been a long road to travel alone
I wish I had never roamed
I thought I’d soon see my mother and dad
But now I am left alone

You cheated me you made me lonely
I tried to be your very own
There’ll come a day you’ll want me only
Cause when I leave I’ll be a long time gone
    I’ll be a long time gone
    I’ll be a long time gone
    When I leave
    I’ll be a long time gone
You’re gonna be sad you’re gonna be weepin
You’re gonna be blue and all alone
You’ll regret the day you’ll see me leavin
Cause when I leave I’ll be a long time gone
You’ll see my face through tears and sorrow
You’ll miss the love you called your own
Maybe there’ll be no tomorrow
Cause when I leave I’ll be a long time gone

    Been a long time travelin’ here below
    Been a long time travelin’ away from my home
    Been a long time travelin’ here below
    Gonna lay this ol’ body down
When I can read my titles clear
To mansions in the sky
I’ll bid farewell to every fear
And wipe my weepin’ eye
May tears like a wild deluge come
And storms of sorrow fall
May I but safely reach my home
My God my heaven my all
There I shall bathe my weary soul
In seas of heavenly rest
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast
alternate version:
Ye fleeting charms of earth farewell
Your springs of joy are dry
My soul now seeks another home
A brighter world on high
Farewell my friends whose tender care
Has long engaged my love
Your fond embrace I now exchange
For better friends above

I’m longing for a love I’ve never known
Someone who my feelings I can’t hide
I long to kiss and hold you in my arms
Oh I love you and I’m aching so inside
    Oh you belong to someone else my darlin
    I wish that I had met you long ago
    I don’t care if I don’t see tomorrow
    Yes I’m longing for a love I’ll never know
When we’re together I can’t hide my feelings
When we’re apart my spirit sinks so low
If I can’t make you mine I’m not worth livin
Yes I’m longing for a love I’ve never known

‘Mid the green fields of Virginia, dear I met you
Where the roses red and white around us grew
When I held you in my arms and gently kissed you
The robins sang the sweetest song we knew
I am longing for old Virginia, for old Virginia and you
And I’m hoping the soul within you is longing for me too
To Virginia, just like the ivy, my heart clings ever true
And I reckon in the spring I’ll bring a little ring
To old Virginia and you
Though tonight I’m far from you and old Virginia
I still love you as I did that day in June
And when springtime comes again to old Virginia
I’ll build a little cottage just for two

Look away from the cross to that glittering crown
From your cares weary watch look away
There’s a home for the soul where no sorrows can come
And there pleasures will never decay
   Look away (from the cross look away) look away (from the cross to the crown)
   From the cross to that glittering crown (glittering crown)
   Look away (way where you watch) look away (from the cross to the crown)
   From the cross to that glittering crown
Though the burdens of life may be heavy to bear
And your crosses and trials severe
There’s a beautiful hand that is beckoning come
And no heartache and sighings are there
Mid the conflicts of battles of struggles and strife
Bravely onward your journey pursue
Look away look away from the cross to that glittering crown
That’s a waiting in heaven for you

Through this world of pain and sorrow
I have traveled night and day
But my life will soon be over
And I must jour- (and I must jour-) ney on my way
Oh look for me (look for me) for I’ll be there (yes I’ll be there)
Just look for me (just look for me) for I’ll be there
When you reach the gates of heaven
Look for me (look for me) for I’ll be there (yes I’ll be there)
I’m going to a land of pleasure
Where no one ever knows a care
And when you reach the gates of heaven
Look for me (look for me) for I’ll be there (yes I’ll be there)

We see our friends are weeping with the badges on their door
We see their homes in mourning for the loved ones come no more
You can say just what you please, death rides on every breeze
Look how this world has made a change
   Just look how this world has made a change (made a change)
   Just look how this world has made a change (made a change)
   You can see every day how the people pass away
   Look how this world has made a change
Our friends are passing over to some far distant shore
We seek them and we call them but they answer us no more
Their throbbing hearts today tomorrow pass away
Look how this world has made a change
Dear sinner, o get ready, you must meet your god on high
For death is all around you and it will not pass you by
Death knocks at every door no matter where you go
Look how this world has made a change

Look up look down that lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry my love
Hang down your head and cry
The darkest night I ever saw
Was the day I left my home my love
The day I left my home
Look up and down that lonesome road
Where all our friends have gone my love
Where all our friends have gone
The best of friends must surely part
So why not you and I my love
So why not you and I
Look up look down that lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry my love
Hang down your head and cry

I haven’t forgot the day you left me
The chances are I never will
I cried at least a month of Sundays
But I wondered if my heart would ever heal
And you knew how much 1 needed you
But still you turned away
Now you wantin’ to come back to me
Afraid you made a big mistake
You hope it’s not too late
Well look who’s needin’ who
It’s not me crying over you
I know just what you been through
Ain’t it strange
time changes things
Now look who’s needing who
I don’t want you thinking that I’m a cold heart
I’m not trying to turn my back on you
But the fire of love ain’t always welcome
You’ve been through a time or two
If I remember right
It wasn’t me who threw our love away
Have you forgot
not so long ago
I were where you are today
It was me begging you to stay
Thanks to anyone who can put me right on the missing words and put me right
on those that I’ve gotten wrong.

My father found stone that was hewed out the mountain
Lord, my father found the stone that came rolling down from Babylon
My father found the stone that was hewed out the mountain
Lord it’s tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
Oh yes tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
    I’m looking for the stone that was hewed out the mountain
    Lord I’m looking for the stone that came rolling down from Babylon
    I’m looking for the stone that was hewed out the mountain
    Lord it’s tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
    Oh yes tearin’ down the kingdom of this world
my mother…
my brother…

Many years I’ve been lookin’ for a place to call home
But I still didn’t find it so I must travel on
I don’t care for the fine mansions on earth’s sinkin sand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
   Lord build me just a cabin in the corner of gloryland
   In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
   Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus’ hand
    Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
Listen Lord I’m not askin’ to live in the midst
For I know that I’m not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask Him for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
I’ve many dear loved one’s who’ve gone on this way
On the grapevine of mournin’ shall I hear them all say
Come and join in the singin’ and play in our band
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

Oh, Lord, I’m in your care
Oh, Lord, I’m in your care
Your loving arms around me
Evil cannot harm me
Oh, Lord, I’m in your care
All day long I’m in your care
All day long I’m in your care
Your loving arms around me
Evil cannot harm me
Lord, I’m in your care
When I was sick, I was in your care
When I was sick, I was in your care
Your loving arms around me
Evil cannot harm me
Lord, I’m in your care
I’m a friendless child, but I’m in your care
I’m a friendless child, but I’m in your care
Your loving arms around me
Evil cannot harm me
Lord, I’m in your care

When the way seems dark and long
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
Give me grace to shout and shine
Ever in the life devine
Lord lead me on from day to day
   Oh lead me on from day to day
   I want to walk the holy way
   Oh friends forsake me all along
   I asked the Lord to lead me on
In this world of doubt and gloom
When all flowers start to bloom
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
I have put my faith in thee
‘Til the homely hour shall be
Lord lead me on from day to day
When old age is feeling on
And my strength is almost gone
Hold to my hand dear I pray
Surely thou will n’er forsake
And in heaven I’ll awake
Lord lead me on from day to day

Down life’s highway alone I trod
I’ve always put my trust in God
But you’ll find out that your silver and gold
Won’t pay the price to protect your soul
   Oh I want the Lord to protect my soul
   To lead me on to heaven’s door
   My life down here will soon be o’er
   And I want the Lord to protect my soul
There’s many a church down life’s highway
Where people sing rejoice and pray
Why don’t you stop at one and join the fold
And ask the Lord to protect your soul
When this ol’ world is doomed in sin
You’ll cry oh Lord please let me
It’ll be to late to make your call
To ask the lord to protect my soul

 Lost lost lost Lost in this world without you Lost lost lost Lost in this world without you
Since you turned me down all I do is ramble roundAnd I don’t care what happens to meMy heart was young and gay till the day you went awayNow life here means nothing to me
The words you said to me still haunts my memoryIt seems they’re on my mind both day and nightThe lies that you told torture my weary soulLove is blind I guess I couldn’t see

    Lonesome, lonesome, pining away
    Now you say its best to part
    Even though it breaks my heart
    I`m lost and I`ll never find the way
Since you said we must part darling you have broke my heart
I am drifting like a ship lost at sea
In a world of despair its so lonesome there
Why don`t you come back to me
You said you`d be true no one else would ever do
I believed you with all my heart and soul
But you broke every vow and its all over now
I`m left in this world lone and cold

I’m a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman’s lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I’m lost too late to pray
Lord, I’ve paid the cost on the lost highway
Now boys, don’t start your rambling round
On this road of sin or you’re sorrow bound
Take my advice or you’ll curse the day
You started rolling down that lost highway

Long John walkin’ around in the rain
He’s long gone Lost John
Long gone Lost John
No hat on his head no shoes on his feet
He’s a beggin the women for his meat
I had an ol’ dog and his name was
like a rabbit through Bowlin’ Green
Lost John walked around in rain
Around the corner left him sittin’ by the ol’ railroad

Our family is proud of their lost soldier son
Not because they believe in the flag or a gun
They miss him because they remember him well
And loved him so dearly ‘for the day that he fell
All I knew was the pictures some stories they told
About young Carl Junior that good hearted boy
We had a connection I’ll tell it to you
He liked the good music now just like I do
I see a kind face staring down from the wall
Every time that I pass through my grandparents hall
It’s almost reflection his face so like mine
My uncle Carl Junior now in the great line
My mother remembers the day that she heard
As she learned of her brother she spoke not a word
A small yellow paper received on that day
It read killed in action in France far away
They still love him dearly it all seems so sad
Grandmother grandfather my mother and dad
They cherish the last things he won from afar
That one purple heart and a bright silver star
Now nothing can bring the boy back to the fold
But his precious memories ever loving we hold
When the music is playing and we’re all gathered there
Our spirits rekindle no more to despair

We went out one evening my darling and I
She seemed so different and I wondered why
We stopped at a tavern and there I could see
That she loved another one better than me
   While they dancing and I sat alone
   I knew I had lost her the one I loved
   Lost to a stranger I never had seen
   The waltz they were playing had ended my dream
The band was playing an old fashioned waltz
The dance floor was crowded and it wasn’t long
When up stepped a stranger I never had seen
He asked my darling will you dance with me

Darling I am all alone in our little mountain home
It’s lonely cold and loveless now inside
For your childish vows of love lasted only one short year
Then you went away to be another’s bride
   You will never know the pain   
   That I felt the day you left
   Should you ever wed again
   Let me wish you love and wealth
For that same old whippoorwill   breaks the silence on the hill
As I stand and gaze upon it’s faded wall
Where your picture used to hang   in a little golden frame
And the vision of your smile I still recall

Now you can take my money and you can take my pride
You can take that long road down the mountain side
Go downtown and fool around but you’re not fooling me
I’m not the one you love so don’t come home to me
   I’m tired of being lied to tired of growing old
   Tired of living my life for love grown cold
Now you can catch a wild bird and you can set it free
But you can’t turn loose the pain that’s trapped inside of me
You can teach the cheating kind to live the golden rule
My mama didn’t raise me to be a dog-gone fool
Now you can take your whiskey and you can take your wine
And I might spend some lonely nights but I’ll just take my time
There comes a time a broken heart just has to close it’s door
Tired of giving part, just can’t give no more

    Love me darlin just tonight
    Take your arms and hold me tight
    Tomorrow you may hold another
    Love me darlin’ just tonight
You say tomorrow you’re leaving
WEll I hope you know the way that’s right
Well I pray to God you don’t leave me
Love me darlin just tonight
Try to find true love in your hard
Tomorrow we may not have to part
But if you feel you must leave me
Love me darlin just tonight

That night we parted long ago
I vowed my love I’d never show
Sweetheart I find that I can’t hide
My love beneath this foolish pride
If I could hold you one more time
And kiss the lips that once were mine
It would ease this aching hearrt of mine
If you would say you love me one more time
Oh won’t you take me back once more
Give me the love I’m longing for
It would ease this aching heart of mine
If you would say you love me one more time

Two trees on a hillside of the mountain
Always looking up towards the sky
Remind me of my papa and my mama
Who lived there eighty years before they died
   Now a bright moon is shining in the valley
   An old wagon leans against a stack of hay
   Two graves on a hillside by the cabin
   My mom and dad are resting there today
The burning of the green wood on the fireplace
The fallen snow around the red bud trees
The branches of the laurel by the creek bed
And the rippling waters of the gentle stream
Papa used to talk about the young days
When he and mama first were settled there
He spoke about the love of the mountains
That he and mama shared together there

As you read this letter that I write to you
Sweetheart I hope you understand
That you’re the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can
   Sweetheart I beg you to come home tonight
   I’m so blue and all alone
   I promise that I’ll treat you right
   Love, oh love oh please come home
That old wind is cold and slowly creeping ’round
And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
Your baby’s hungry sick and cold

That dancin’ moon is on the water you feel inclined romantic’ly
If you do I think you oughta love someone like me
There ain’t no place you should be goin’ ain’t no need for you to leave
It’s a lover’s night the stars are showin’ you could love someone like me
   Someone else might try and bind you
   But my love will set you free
   If your heart has got a mind to
   You could love someone like me
   You could love someone like me
That dancin’ moon is on the water you feel inclined romantic’ly
If you do I think you oughta love someone like me
You’ve been thinkin’ love won’t find you honey wait right here and see
If your heart has got a mind to you could love someone like me

As along lifes way you go
Clouds may hide the light of day
Have no fear for well you know
Love will roll the clouds away
    Love will roll the clouds away
    Turn the darkness into day
    I’m so glad I now can say
    Love will roll the clouds away
When the road is rough and long
And the world is cold and gray
Lift your voice in happy song
Love will roll the clouds away
God is watching over all
And he hears you when you pray
Trust in him when shadows fall
Love will roll the clouds away

We have met and we have parted
We have spoke our last goodbye
You have proved to me false hearted
You may now forever go 
You have wrecked the heart I’ve cherished
You have done me day by day
You are false but I’ll forgive you
To forget you I cannot say 
For I love you dear I love you
More than all this world I know
You have proved to me false hearted
You may now forever go 
On the river bank I’ll loiter
Till I see your face once more
Then I’ll plunge beneath the water
And I’ll land on some far shore 
Among the trees and bushes
Where the dark green willow sway
In the cold and silent rushes
There you’ll find my lonely grave 
O I wish I was white marble
Cold and white on some far shore
This poor heart would cease from troubling
And I’d feel the pain no more

I first met you down in lover’s lane
You were just like an angel with angels golden wings
We walked along we’d sing a song the birds are sing too
Seems like heaven’s here on earth just to be with you
You’re just the girl of my dreams
though it seems that my dreams never come true
At night we’d sit out in the old porch swing
The stars were shining brightly and softly you would sing
You’d sing of happy days gone by it makes me happy too
It would be like heaven here on earth if I could be with you
You’re just the girl of my dreams
though it seems that my dreams never come true
I first met you down in lover’s lane
You were just like an angel my little brown eyed Jane
We walked along we’d hum a song the birds are sing too
It seems like heaven’s here on earth just to be with you
You’re just the girl of my dreams
though it seems my dreams never come true
You’re just the girl of my dreams
though it seems my dreams never come true

  Jack and May sweethearts were they
They were engaged to be wed
Many a promise Jack made her
Many a love word was said
But they quarreled one night as most true lovers do
She bade him not come any more
She gave him his hat
Jack started to go
But he lingered to say at the door
    Tie up love’s broken cords and let us be sweethearts again
    Darling you know I love you to part would cause me pain
    So let’s forget the past make up and kiss
    Make up and be lovers again
Years rolled by and neither one was wed
And one morning Jack was found dead
She can not tell you why that the tears rolled from her eye
And she goes to the grave every day
Lonesome and sad her sweetheart is not there
His words they still ring in her ear
    Tie up love’s broken cords and let us be sweethearts again
    Darling you know I love you to part would cause me pain
    So let’s forget the past make up and kiss
    Make up and be lovers again

And so you have come back to me
And say the old love’s growing yet
You’ve tried through all these weary years
You’ve tried so vainly to forget
   Oh, no, I cannot take your hand
   God never gives us back our youth
   The loving heart you slighted then
   Was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
Farewell, farewell now we must part
You never meant to do me wrong
God sent this anguish to my heart
To teach me to be brave and strong
Farewell, I think I love you yet
As friend to friend, God bless you, dear
And guide you through these weary years
To where the skies are always clear

I’m lonesome tonight while the moon’s shining bright
Thinking of you, little dear
I’m here all alone in our little cabin home
I’m counting the stars in the blue
   Lovesick and sorrow is what you brought to me
   Oh why, tell me why, did you go
   You left me to wander in this whole wide world alone
   I’m counting the stars in the blue
I dream every night as I lay in my cabin
And pray to the One up above
To keep you for me and someday you’ll return, dear
I’m counting the stars up above
I’ll take your picture and frame it in gold
Reading love letters from you
I’m longing to see you in our little cabin home
I’m counting the stars in the blue

Once I had my loving sweetheart
Her hair was long and black as coal
The tears they fell the night she left me
It broke my heart to see her go
    We used to go strollin’ in the moonlight
    But that has been some time ago
    And now the golden leaves are falling
    As I travel down this lonesome road
Now it’s cold and the snow is falling
It has covered up the ground
Just a year ago we were together
Now your love can’t be found

I’ve held you close ten thousand times
You promised to be mine
You broke my heart ten thousand ways
When you kissed me your last time
   I’m worried troubled I can’t sleep
   This story I must tell
   The worst mistake I ever made
   Was loving you too well
Another man took you from me
He stole your heart away
I’ve often prayed to God above
You’d wander back some day

Low and lonely, sad and blue
Thinking only, of little you
Always trying, to keep from crying
I’m low and lonely over you
Do you miss me, say you do
Tell me darling, please tell me true
Do you yearn dear, for my return dear
I’m low and lonely over you
Low and lonely, weary too
You’re the only, true love I knew
Don’t be long dear, you know it’s wrong dear
I’m low and lonely over you
You’re my darling, you’re my dear
You can trust me, so never fear
How I miss you, I long to kiss you
I’m low and lonely over you

Lord I don’t want to do one thing on my own
Put me where you want me Lord where I belong
Give me the strength Lord to do thy perfect will
And when I’m in the lowest valley I can climb the highest hill
   Lord I want to be what you want me to be
   Lord I want to do the things you want me to do
   Lord I want to stay in the center of thy will
   When I’m in the lowest valley I can climb the highest hill
This world gets more wicked every day
People’s hearts have grown cold, forgotten how to pray
But if I live to be a hundred I’ll keep holding to your hand
Until you come and take me home to that promised land

One evening getting dark, we first met at the park
Sitting by the fountain all alone;
I lifted up my hat, and then began to chat
She said she’d love to see me at her home
   Such a star I’ve never seen, she’s as pretty as a queen
   She’s as perfect as an angel from above,
   If she’ll only be my wife, I’ll live happy all my life
   With that aggravating beauty, Lulu Walls
If she were only mine, I would build a house so fine
Around it so many fences tall,
It would make me jealous free, that no one else but me
Could gaze on that beauty, Lulu Walls
One evening getting late, I met her at the gate
I asked her if she’d wed me in the fall,
She only turned away, and nothing would she say
That aggravating beauty, Lulu Walls

It’s all over now but the crying
She’s gone and there’s nothing more to do
And today our new guest is arriving
I’ve got to straighten up and make room for the blues
   Take her picture from the wall
   Let it fall let it fall
   Then turn around and face the empty room
   While she’s waving goodbye
   Wipe the tears from your eyes
   Then staighten up and make room for the blues
I never new a house could be so lonely
In every room there’s memories left with you
In this big old chair you said you loved me only
Guess i’ll move on out and make room for the blues

You say tomorrow you’re going
It’s so hard for me to believe
I’m making plans for the heartache
‘Cause you’re making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I’m making plans for the teardrops
“Cause you’re making plans to leave
   You’re making plans to forget me
   I’m making plans to miss you
   I’m getting ready to grieve
I’m making plans to be lonesome
Cause you’re making plans to leave

First thing I remember knowing was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young ones dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town not knowing where I’m bound
No one could steer me right but mama tried.
One and only rebel child from a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning towards the bad I kept on turning
‘Til mama couldn’t hold me anymore.
   And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
   No one could steer me right but mama tried mama tried
   Mama tried to raise me better but her pleading I denied
   That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried.
My dear old daddy rest his soul left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused.

   Three men on the mountain
   Up on Calvary
   And the Man in the middle was Jesus
   He died for you and me
Well the man on the left was a sinnin man
Tied to the cross, he bled
He could have been forgiven
But he mocked the Lord instead
You say you are the Son of God
They nailed you to that tree
Come down, come down and save us
If God your Father be
Well the man on the right was a sinner too
But he was sorry for his sins
He asked the Lord’s forgiveness
And Jesus said to him
Fear not, fear not this earthly death
Before this day is o’er
You’ll be with me in Paradise
On Heaven’s golden shore

I am a man of constant sorrow
I’ve seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was borned and raised
(The place where he was borned and raised) 
For six long years I’ve been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I find
For in this world I’m bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
(He has no friends to help him now) 
It’s fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I’m bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I’ll die upon this train
(Perhaps he’ll die upon this train) 
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
(While he is sleeping in his grave) 
Maybe your friends think I’m just a stranger
My face you’ll never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I’ll meet you on God’s golden shore
(He’ll meet you on God’s golden shore)

If you need some advice in being lonely
If you need a little help in feelin’ blue
If you need some advice on how to cry all night
Come to me I’m the man with the blues
    I’m the man with a hundred thousand heart aches (a good selection all in blue)
   And I’ve got most any color of the blues
   So if you need a little shove in foulin’ up in love
   Come to me I’m the man with the blues
You have a trusting man you can depend on
He tells you you’re the one he dearly loves
Your not content to be his wife you long for the restless life
Come to me I’m the man with the blues

Tonight down here in the valley
I’m lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill
Do you recall when we parted
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill
I’ve waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
‘Cause I know you are living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill
The lights shine bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you’re alone with your pride dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill

There’s folks building homes as sweet as can be
They’re levelling their yards and planting their trees
But my little hut I’ll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
   A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
   A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
   Built by my Lord beyond Calvary
   But my little hut I’ll just let it be
   Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
Each day I am getting more ready to go
He’s cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I’m packing my troubles I’m bound with his love
Get ready to move to Heaven above
To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you go
There’s coming a time when we’ll all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that day

There’s folks building homes as sweet as can be

In a quiet country village stood a maple on the hill
Where I sat with my Geneva long ago
As the stars were shining brightly we could hear the whippoorwill
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
We would sing love songs together when the birds had gone to rest
We would listen to the murmur o’er the hill
Will you love me, little darling as you did those starry nights
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill
Don’t forget me, little darling when they lay me down to die
Just one little wish, my darling, that I pray
As you linger there in sadness thinking darling of the past
Let your teardrops kiss the flowers on my grave
I will soon be with the angels on that bright and peaceful shore
Even now I hear them coming o’er the hill
So goodbye, my little darling It is time for us to part
I must leave you ‘neath the maple on the hill

Oh I left her in the mountains in the golden summertime
I told her not to worry little darling pal of mine
I told her that I loved her and always would be true
When the moon comes o’er the mountain I’ll be waitin’ there for you
She’s my darling she’s my sweetheart she’s the one for me
With a heart as pure as gold and in dreams her face I see
Soon I’ll be returning and the wedding bells will chime
And I’ll make her mine forever when it’s maple sugar time
Jerry Tuckett will play the fiddle folks will come from miles away
To the maple sugar hoedown what a happy wedding day
I’ll be a country king and I’ll paint a pretty scene
I’ll kiss her smiling ruby lips she’ll be my maple sugar Queen

   Suns gonna shine in my back door some day
   Suns gonna shine in my back door some day
   Suns gonna shine in my back door some day
   March winds gonna blow my blues all away
Low down fireman dirty engineer
Low down fireman dirty engineer
Low down fireman dirty engineer
Stole my gal left me standing here
My momma told long years ago
Never to marry no girls that I know
Spend all your money and wear out your clothes
What will become of you God only knows

Now you bake right (uh-huh) with Martha White (yes, ma’am)
Goodness gracious, good and light, Martha White

Get Martha White self-rising meal
The one all purpose meal

For goodness’ sake

There’s a girl on my mind I can’t get over
Who’d break the heart of any man
Without her things just falls to pieces
Oh I’m singing about my Mary Ann
   So I’ll just keep touching up my gray hair
   Live and hope someday she’ll understand
   It’s no matter if I live to be a hundred
   There’ll always be a place in my heart for Mary Ann
I know she’s out there somewhere in a world that can’t be found
Just to think of her still tears me down
If teardrops were pennies I’d be a wealthy man
From the tears I’ve cried for Mary Ann

We started out from Bern one sunny August morn
There was just the four of us against the Matterhorn
There was Albert the Australian and John the Irishman
Me and Bill from Britain, mad dogs in the sun
   Matterhorn, Matterhorn
   Men have tried and men have died to climb the Matterhorn
   That mighty Matterhorn
Two miles up we lost John and our rations fell below
Now Al and Bill are lying beneath an avalanche of snow
Now here I am alone and I know I cannot stop
Two more yards in front of me before I reach the top
Now here I am a dying upon the Matterhorn
Not a thing for me to lie in or a thing to keep me warm
The Queen would surely knight me if I could get back down
But it’s closer here to heaven than it is back to the ground

Was on the high high holy day
The very best day in the year
Little Matty Groves had gone to church
Holy words for to hear
Holy words for to hear
The first to come down was dressed in red
And the second one dressed in green
The third to come down was Lord Daniel’s wife
As fair as any queen
Just as fair as any queen
Then Matty Groves says to one of his men
See the fair one dressed in white
Although she is Lord Daniel’s wife
I’ll be with her tonight
I’ll be with her tonight
Well the little foot page was standing by
And heard every word that was said
He says Lord Daniel shall know tonight
Before I go to bed
Before I go to bed
He had 15 miles for to go that night
And 10 of them he run
He run til he come to the broke down bridge
Then he bent to his breast and swum
He bent to his breast and swum
He swum til he come to where the grass was green
He took to his feet and he run
He run til he come to Lord Daniel’s Gate
Then he rattled at the bells and they rung
He rattled at the bells and they rung
What news What news Lord Daniel says
What news to me have you brung
Little Matty Groves is in the bed with your wife
And their hearts both beat as one
And their hearts both beat as one
Now if the truth you’ve told to me
A rich man you shall be
But if a lie you’ve told to me
I’ll hang you to a tree
I’ll hang you to a tree
He gathered him up about 50 good men
He done it with a free good will
Then he popped his bugle unto his lips
And he blowed it loud and shrill
He blowed it loud and shrill
I’d better get up said little Matty Groves
I’d better get up and go
I know your husband is a coming home
For I heard his bugle blow
I heard his bugle blow
Lay down lay down my precious one
Lay down and go to sleep
It’s only my father’s shepherd’s horn
And he’s a calling for his sheep
He’s a calling for his sheep
So they laid down together again
And they soon were fast asleep
And when they awoke it was broad daylight
Lord Daniel at their feet
Lord Daniel at their feet
Get up from there your naked man
And put you on some clothes
I never intend for to have it said
That a naked man I slow
That a naked man I slow
Oh give me a chance said little Matty Groves
A chance to fight for my life
For there you have two very fine swords
And me not as much as a knife
And me not as much as a knife
Oh yes I have two very fine swords
And they cost me deep in the purse
You may have the finest one
And I will take the worst
Yes I will take the worst
Then Matty Groves struck the very first lick
And he wounded Lord Daniel sore
Lord Daniel struck the very next lick
And he drove Matty Groves to the floor
He drove Matty Groves to the floor
Then he taken his lady by the hand
And he sat her on his knee
And he says Now which do you love the best
Little Matty Groves or me
Little Matty Groves or me
Very well I like your rosy cheeks
Very well I like your chin
But better I love little Matty Groves
Than you and all of your kin
Than you and all of your kin
You can dig my grave on a pretty green hill
Dig it wide and deep
And put little Matty Groves in my arms
Lord Daniel at my feet
Lord Daniel at my feet

Like a bird that’s lost its mate in flight
I’m alone and oh so blue tonight
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea
May you  never be alone like me
I believed the lies you told to me
When you whispered Dear I worship thee
Now here am I alone and blue
All because I loved no one but you
I gave up my friends I left my home
When you promised to be mine alone
Now you’re gone our love could never be
May you  never be alone like me. 
In the bible God’s own words do say
For ev’ry wrong some day you’ll  pay
I pray the Lord to set me  free
May you  never be alone like me

Well I wandered way back in the mountains
I was searching for fortune and fame
I found where the water runs deep from the hills
They call it the medicine springs
They call it the medicine springs
It was there that I met a fair maiden
Yellow hair and big eyes of blue
She told me one day she loved only me
That she’d forever be true
That she’d forever be true
Well I wanted the best for my darlin’
But my pockets were empty and bare
My love was so great for that starlett of mine
I took what another man had
I took what another man had
As I sit here alone in this jailhouse
With a letter I can’t hardly read
It said my darlin’ has left this ol’ world
She’s a waitin’ in heaven for me
She’s a waitin’ in heaven for me
Some day I’ll go back to the mountains
Where I’ll spend the rest of my days
And the water that runs frome the side of the hill
Will water her flowery grave
Will water her flowery grave

   Meet me by the moonlight love meet me
   Meet me by the moonlight alone alone
   I have a sad story to tell you
   All down by the moonlight alone
I’ve always loved you my darling
You said I’ve never been true
I’d do anything just to please you
I’d die any day just for you
I have a ship on the ocean
All lined with silver and gold
And before my little darling shall suffer
I’ll have the ship anchored and sold
If I had wings like an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
I’d fly to the arms of my darling
And there I’d be willing to die

You have heard of little Moses in the bull rush
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing
   There is going to be a meeting in the air
   In that sweet sweet by and by
   I am going to meet you meet you over there
   In that home beyond the sky
   The singing you will hear never heard by mortals ears
   Will be glorious I do declare
   And God’s own son will be the leading one
   At that meeting in the air
There are many many others through the bible
I should like to meet them all I do declare
By and by the lord will surely let us meet them
At that meeting in the air

This morning found me down and troubled hurting deep inside
And if I thought it might do some good I guess I could have cried
Your memory crept into my heart like a winter morning chill
It chilled my heart my blood ran cold I guess I love you still
I try my best to think of ways to keep your memory still
You left a place in spite of me that time can’t seem to kill
The pieces of my broken heart just never seem to fit
There’s one still missing when I rearrange I guess I love you yet
The snow lays in the trees and turns at night from white to blue
I’m looking to replace a life of dreams I lost with you
Yes I’ll be trying to fill my time so that I’m not alone
But old memories of what used to be cover everything I own

On a dark stormy night the angels called mother
The love that we shred for such a short while
She called us around and told us she’s leaving
Then closing her eyes she went with a smile
   Mother’s at rest in a lonesome old graveyard
   On a hill far away there stands her white tomb
   With the grass covered o’er it seems so neglected
   When the spring season comes sweet flowers will bloom
I’ll never forget the love mother gave us
As children we played around our old home
I know her reward is a mansion in heaven
While children on earth are scattered and gone

Mother left this world of sorrow
Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home No mother nor dad
   There’s a little lonesome grave yard
   On these tomestones it did say
   On mother’s “gone but not forgotten”
    On dad’s “we’ll meet again someday”
I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He’ll do the rest
Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they’ll dwell with god above
Where they’ll meet there friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious love

I can’t forget you little darlin’
Each night you’re always in my dreams
Your face is always here before me
On thru the years with you I’ll dream
How we used to love each other
It’s just memories of the past
I should have known you were false hearted
That our love would never last
Each night I go down to the bar room
There I’ll drink the warm red wine
And I’ll play the lonesome jukebox
For your love is on my mind

I’m riding on that Memphis Special
I’m riding on that Memphis Train
I’m on my way to see my darlin
And I won’t ever leave again
That whistle used to make me lonesome
But now it seems to sing a song
It’s singin’ ’bout my blue eyed darlin
And how she’s waiting for so long
Please engineer open the throttle
Fireman shovel on the coal
And when that porter hollers Memphis
Her smiling face I’ll see once more

Went down to camp meeting just the other afternoon
Just to hear ’em shout and sing
For to tell each other how they love one another
And to make the hallelujahs ring
There was old Brother Daniel and Cousin Ebeneezer
Uncle Rufus and his lame gal Sue
Aunt Polly and Melinda and old Mother Bender
Well  I never seen a happier crew
Oh  little children  I believe
Oh  little children  I believe
Oh  little children  I believe
I’m a Methodist till I die
I’m a Methodist  a Methodist  ’tis my belief
I’m a Methodist till I die
Till old grim death comes a-knocking at the door
I’m a Methodist till I die
Well they all go there just to have a big time
And to eat their grub so sly
Have applesauce butter and sugar in the gourd
And a great big Methodist pie
Well you ought to hear the ringing when they all get to singin’
That good old bye and bye
See Jimmy McGee in the top of a tree
Saying  how is this for high
Then they all join hands and dance around a ring
Just a singin’ all the while
You’d think it was a cyclone coming through the air
You could hear shout a half a mile
Then a bell brings loud and the great big crowd
Breaks ranks and up they fly
While I took hold of the sugar in the gourd
And I cleaned up the Methodist Pie

Mid the green fields of Virginia
In the veil of Shenandoah
There’s an ivy covered homestead that I love
With it’s white old fashioned chimney
And it’s simple homelike hours
Tis the home of my dear parents now above
   There’s a peaceful cottage there
   A happy home so dear
   My heart is longing for them day by day
   Where I spent life’s golden hours
   In the veil of Shenandoah
   Mid the green fields for Virginia far away
Mid the green fields of Virginia
Stands an old mill by the stream
I once wondered to that spot to sing and play
And how often I would throw the stone
Into the pebbling brook
I would dream someday it’d carry me away

You’re a midnight angel at twelve is when you start
Looking for a victim to feed your hungry heart
You say you don’t love me still I wait all alone
For my midnight angel to come home
It seems I spend a lifetime between midnight and dawn
Watching from my window for a man to bring you home
Listening to the silence while waiting all alone
For my midnight angel to come home

Do you ever feel lonesome when you’re down in San Antone
Beg steal or borrow two nickels or a dime to call you on the phone
I’ll meet you at Alamo mission we can say our prayers
The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will hear us as we kneel there
   In the Midnight
   In the Moonlight
   In the Midnight Moonlight Moonlight
Did you ever feel sorrow for the deeds that you have done
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun
And the ocean is howling with things that might have been
And that last good-morning sunrise would be the brightest you’ve ever seen

Midnight on the highway and the stars are all aglow
And it seems I’m always drivin, and I miss my darlin’ so 
   Midnight on the highway, big bright moon above
   It lights the white lines for me, all the way home to my love 
Can’t you hear the wheels a hummin’ as we roll on through the night
My desire is to hold you and I’ll be home before daylight 
Now the shadows quickly fadin’ as a town comes into view
Three more miles my journey’s over and again I’ll be with you

T’was midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I’d keep
And I think of her I’d left behind
And ask if she’d be true and kind
I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she’d rest
And press me to her loving breast
Oh Willy don’t go back to sea
There’s other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don’t go where the bullets fly
The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other’s bride
But still my thoughts will sometimes stray
To thee when thou are far away
I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as thine
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine
Then fare-thee-well I’d rather make
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine

We were wed in the hills of ol’ Virginia
We were happy there together all alone
But I strayed away from my darlin
Through this dark and stormy night I’m goin home
   When the high wind blows from heaven
   I whisper your name alone
   I’m on my way back darlin’
   As the midnight storm rolls on
When the cold dreary rain starts fallin
And the clouds hide the bright golden moon
As I see your face right before me
I can cry as I sing this lonesome tune

I have been all around my old home town
I have searched everywhere I know
I can’t find any trace of my girl in this place
Now there’s nothing to do but go
   I’ll be riding that midnight train when I’m leaving
   And I’m goin away to stay
   Always wanted to know where this engine did go
   Gonna go where it goes today
Oh she said she’d be true til the fighting was through
That she’d wait for me til the end
But she’s proven untrue and our sweet love is through
So I’m catching the train again
When she hears this old song then she’ll know that she’s wrong
Cause I’m leaving my old home town
Oh she told me she’d wait just to be my sweet date
Then she threw down my heart to the ground

No matter what I say or do you’re never satisfied
I’ve tried and tried so many times I’m leavin you now good bye
   I’m ridin on that midnight train my head’s a hangin low
   These awful blues will follow me where ever I may go
Oh why on earth was I ever born I’ll never understand
To fall in love with a woman like you in love with another man
You broke a heart that trusted you why wasn’t it made of stone
I’m left in a world black as night, yet I must journey on

   It’s mighty dark for me to travel
   For my sweetheart she is gone
   The road is rough and filled with gravel
   But I must journey on and on.
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
T’was on the day that I first met her
That I told her of her love.
Many a night we’d stroll together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
For I know I’ll meet her there.
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love that’s gone
Knowing soon we’ll be together
She’s the only love I’ve known.

Way down in the state of GeorgiaThrough the swamps and evergladesThere’s a hole in Tiger MountainGod help the man who gets lost in Miller’s Cave
I had a girl in Waycross GeorgiaBut she had unfaithful waysShe made me feel I was unwantedLike the bats and the bears in Miller’s CaveI couldn’t stand the way she did meI could take her lowdown waysBefore I stay with a cheatin’ womanI’ll go live with the bears in Miller’s CaveI caught her out one Sunday morningWith a man they call Big DaveThe meanest man in Waycross GeorgiaI’d rather fight a mountain lion in Miller’s Cave
I said you’ll pay both you and DaveyI’m gonna see you in your graveThey laughed at me and then I shot themI took their cheating scheming bones to Miller’s Cave
That woman made me feel unwantedBut I showed her I was braveThe most wanted man in the state of GeorgiaBut they’ll never find me ’cause I’m lost in Miller’s Cave

When the whistle blows each morning
And I walk down in this cold dark mine.
I say a prayer to my dear savior
Please let me see the sunshine one more day.
   When oh when will it be over
   When will I lay these burdens down?
   And when I die dear Lord in Heaven
   Please take my soul from beneath that cold dark ground.
I still grieve for my poor brother
And I still hear my dear old mother cry
When late that night they came and told her
He’d lost his life down in that Big Shoal mine.
I have no shame I feel no sorrow
If on this earth not much I own
Cause I have the love of my sweet children
An old plow mule a shovel and a hoe.

I just left my home place where I couldn’t sleep
For missing a woman that I couldn’t keep
She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps haunting me when I’m by myself.
   So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
   Tell funny stories turn the juke box up loud
   Come on sit at my table where the drinks are on me
   Just gather round me ’cause misery loves company.
Now I’m not the first one that’s lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted scheme
But this is the first time I suffered myself
Help me get over this love I’ll handle the next love all by myself.

Dear wife I found a model church
And worshipped there today
It made me think of the good old times
Before my hair was gray
   The meetinghouse was finer built
   Than they were years ago
   But I found out when I went in
   It was not built for show
The sexton did not sit me down
Away back by the door
He knew that I was old and deaf
And saw that I was poor
   He must have been a Christian man
   He led me boldly through
   The long aisle of that crowded church
   To find a pleasant pew
I wish you’d heard the singing, wife
it had the old town ring
The preacher said with trumpet voice
Let all the people sing
   Oh Coronation was the tune
   The music upward roared
   I thought I heard the angel choir
   Strike on their harps of gold
I tell you wife it did me good
To sing those hymns once more
I felt just like some wrecked marine
Who gets a glimpse of shore
   It made want to lay aside
   This weather beaten form
   And anchor in that blessed port
   Forever from the storm
Dear wife the toil will soon be o’er
The victory soon be won
The shining strand is just ahead
Our race is nearly run
   We’re near to Canaan’s happy shore
   Our hopes are bright and fair
   Thank God we’ll never sin again
   There’ll be no sorrow there
There’ll be no sorrow there
In heaven above
Where all is love
There’ll be no sorrow there

Run oh Molly run, run oh Molly run
Ten-Brooks gonna beat you to the bright and shining sun
To the bright and shining sun oh Lord
To the bright and shining sun
Ten-Brooks was a big bay horse, he wore a shaggy mane
He run all ’round Memphis, and he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train oh Lord
Beat the Memphis train
Ten-Brooks said to Molly, what makes your head so red
Running in the hot sun with a fever in my head
Fever in my head oh Lord
Fever in my head
Molly said to Ten-Brooks you’re looking mighty squirrel
Ten-Brooks said to Molly I’m leaving this old world
Leaving this old world oh Lord
Leaving this old world
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
She come back to old Kentucky, got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease oh Lord
Beat with all ease
The women’s all a-laughing, the children all a-crying
Men all a-hollering old Ten-Brooks a- flying
Old Ten-Brooks a- flying oh Lord
Old Ten-Brooks a- flying
Kiper, Kiper, you’re not riding right
Molly’s a beating old Ten-Brooks clear out of sight
Clear out of sigh oh Lord
Clear out of sight
Kiper, Kiper, Kiper my son
Give old Ten-Brooks the bridle and let old Ten-Brooks run
Let old Ten-Brooks run oh Lord
Let old Ten-Brooks run
Go and catch old Ten-Brooks and hitch him in the shade
We’re gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready made
In a coffin ready made oh Lord
In a coffin ready made

A mother went out to a party
She left at home her baby son
He cried and begged her not to leave him
But she would not give up her fun
   She kissed his cheek and tried to soothe him
   But would not heed his childish plea
   She heard him call as she was leaving
   Please mommy please stay home with me
The mother joined the merrymakers
And soon was lost in trifling joy
The mellow tunes and flitting shadows
Made her forget her baby boy
   She danced and laughed and did some drinking
   The world for her was full of glee
   But now and then these words would haunt her
   Please mommy please stay home with me
She left the party feeling dizzy
The smell of drink was on her breath
She hurried home to find her baby
In raging pain and nearing death
   The doctor came and looked on sadly
   The case was hopeless, he could see
   The baby died, these words repeating
   Please mommy please stay home with me
The mother now, her life would forfeit
To hear her baby’s voice again
She grieved to think she rudely left him
To satisfy her wicked vein
   Now mothers don’t neglect your duty
   This story should a lesson be
   Do not ignore your baby’s pleading
   Please mommy please stay home with me

   I got money, marbles, and chalk sweetheart
   But I still feel like I am poor
   Cause my money won’t spend, and my marbles won’t roll
   And my chalk won’t write anymore
There’s an old saying that’s been all around
I heard it before I could walk
How some’s got wealth, some’s got health
Others money marbles and chalk
While you were here I was happy and gay
Your presence made me feel so proud
But you left me, for another one day
Now I feel alone in a crowd
Money, marbles, and chalk is alright
For a miser who loves only gold
But give me a chance, to save our romance
For I love you with all of my soul

For many long years I played the lone hand
I rode my horse in many strange lands
Until one day I stopped for awhile
For two blue eyes and sunny smile
So howl away you old coyote
I hear your sad and lonesome song
‘a calling me back to old Montana
Back to those hills where I belong
One day I rode away from home
I’m a traveling back but it won’t be long
I’ll see you again in a little while
You’re my darling sweet my sunny smile

I’ve been a moonshiner for many long years
I spend all of my money on whiskey and beer
I’ll go down to some holler and set up my still
I’ll sell you a gallon for a two dollar bill.
I’ll eat when I’m hungry and I’ll drink when I’m dry
If whiskey don’t kill me Lord I’ll live ’til I die.
God bless them moonshiners they’re all friends of mine
Their breath is a sweet as the dew on the vine.
I’ll go down in some grocery and I’ll drink with my friends
No women to bother me or see what I spend
God bless them pretty women I wish one was mine
For their breath is more sweeter than even moonshine.
God bless that pretty woman I wish she was mine
For her breath is more sweeter than even moonshine.

When every time I hear your name
I remember who’s to blame
How that I was the first to be untrue
You start to pray to god above
When you lose the one you love
And I know I was to blame for losin’ you
   I still remember the sound of your voice dear
   And the thrill of your sweet angel smile
   Tho you’re gone yet you’re still in my heart
   I miss you darling more often than once in a while
It starts with just a careless flirt
You’ll never know how much you”ll hurt
The only one who’s really in you heart
The way i cheated was a shame
Now you no longer wear my name
And it’s oh so many years we’ve been apart

   There’s more pretty girls than one
   More pretty girls than one
   Any old town that I ramble all around
   There’s more pretty girls than one
Now mama talked to me last night
She gave to me some good advice
Said son you ought to quit that old rambling all around
And marry you a sweet loving wife
Now look down that long lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry
I’m thinking all about them pretty little gals
And hoping that I’ll never die

The night Mother died it broke my Daddy’s heart
In anguish he bowed his gray head
And the pitiful way he kept calling her name
I can’t believe my angel is dead
The sparkle that once shined in my Daddy’s eyes
And the spring he once had in his walk
Was replaced with a far away look on his face
As often of my sweet Mother we’d talk
Then the night finally came I was called to his side
On his face was a heavenly smile
Then he reached for my hand and said Son with a smile
In heaven I’ll see our sweet angel tonight

While kneeling by her beside in a cottage on the hill
My mother prayed her blessing for me there
She was talking then with Jesus while everything was still
And I heard my mother call my name in prayer
   Yes I heard my mother call my name in prayer
   She was pouring out her heart to Jesus there
   Then I gave my heart to Him and He saved my soul from sin
   For I heard my mother call my name in prayer
She was anxious for her boy to be just what he ought to be
And she asked the lord to take Him in His care
Just the worlds I can’t remember but I know she prayed for me
For I heard my mother call my name in played
Then I gave my heart to Jesus and I’m living now for him
And someday I’ll go and meet him in the air
For he heard my mother praying and he saved my soul from sin
Yes he heard my mother call my name in prayer

One night while the moon from heaven was shining
My mother was praying for me to come home
She asked her dear lord watch o’er me out yonder
To send me back home to never more roam
When I left my old home way back in the mountains
I said I’d return with honor and fame
But a young reckless heart turned wrong at the crossroads
Now as I go home I bring mother shame
When I got to the place where I spent my childhood
The silvery moon was shining so bright
When I asked my dear friends to tell me of mother
They said she was called to heaven last night
She told them of how she was longing to see me
How lonely her home since I went away
Said darling repent and ask for forgiveness
And meet mother there in heaven some day
Mother has gone to live with the angels
Her soul is at rest around the great throne
Now I have no one left here to advise me
For mother no longer awaits me at home

As a boy I learned of Jesus
With my mother here at home
Gathered there around the fireside
Mother taught us right from wrong
   Happy days I still remember
   With a mother long gone on
   Now rejoicing with the angels (up in heaven)
   Mother’s footsteps guide me on
Mother’s love will always guide us
As I journey on and on
There will be a great reunion
Mother’s footsteps guide me on

   Mothers not dead, she’s only a sleeping
   Just patiently waiting for Jesus to come
   The birds will be singing while Mother is sleeping
   They will sing o’er as the grave sinks away
Well I left my old home way back in the mountains
For mother and father had both passed away
We followed our mother up to the graveyard
For mother was called to heaven that day
 Oh how we miss her around the old home place
Everything seems so lonesome since she went away
Mother is sleeping way back the mountains
Yes mother is sleeping way back in the hills

The postman came and brought a letter
It was from her boy who went away
She gave him up to join the colors
Each time he writes I hear her pray
   Dear God watch o’er my boy in service
   Help him win his victory
   And when this cruel war is over
   Bring him safely back to me
Then came the day they walked together
To the train that took him away
She knew her boy would be a hero
Her smilin eyes just seemed to say
Now soldier boy don’t e’er forger her
She prays to God for you each day
That harm may never overtake you
While you are fighting far away

Motherless children have a hard time when their mother is dead
Motherless children have a hard time when their mother is dead
See them wander from door to door
Lord, they’ve got no place to go
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead
Father will do the best he can when your mother’s dead
Father will do the best he can when your mother’s dead
Father will do the best he can
Some things your father can’t understand
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead, Lord
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead, Lord
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead
Sister will do the best she can when your mother’s dead
Sister will do the best she can
No way she’ll leave you for another man
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead, Lord
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead
When your mother’s dead
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody loves you like your mother can, when your mother’s dead

There’s a big hollow tree down the road here from me
Where you lay down a dollar or two
You stroll ’round the bend and you come back again
There’s a jug full of good old mountain dew
   They call it that mountain dew
   And them that refuse it are few
   I’ll hush up my mug if you fill up my jug
   With that good old mountain dew
My uncle Mort, he’s sawed off and short
He measures about four foot two
But he thinks he’s a giant when you give him a pint
Of that good old mountain dew
Well, my old aunt June bought some brand new perfume
If had such a sweet smelling pew
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed
It was nothing but good old mountain dew
Well, my brother Bill’s got a still on the hill
Where he runs off a gallon or two
The buzzards in the sky get so drunk they can’t fly
From smelling that good old mountain dew

   Like the Mountain Laurel in the grove dear
   My love is it’s ever green
   Like the Mountain Laurel finds the grove dear
   I’ll find you again
Where the mountain breezes blow
There’s a place I long to go
You’ll be waiting there I know
In the pine and we’ll climb
Into the hills we knew in days gone by
When your heart was gay and so was I
And we’ll find a love we left behind
Long ago long ago

There’s a little road back in the mountains
That I traveled on when just a kid
Many years ago I was bound to travel
Now I’m sorry for the things I did
I remember how my Mom was weeping
As she held me close whispered son don’t go
And Daddy’s out stretched hand was trembling
His heart was breaking now I know
After many years I came to see them
My joy to grief turned like a stone
Two graves with words please hurry home son
We’re waiting for you by your mountain road

I met the girl named Jole Blon and I know her sister too
I met Ann from Old Cheyenne and I know Sue City Sue
There’s sweet Marie from Tennessee and Louisiana Lou
I know them all from A to Z and I met Miss Molly too
But of all the pretty girls I met there’s just one girl for me
She lives away back in the hills my Mountain Rosa Lee
Her hair is dark and curly and her eyes are big and blue
Raised on corn and taters and she loves her mountain dew
   Mountain sweet heart
   Mountain Rosa Lee
   Hillbilly baby waiting there for me
   Cheeks are red as roses and lips are meant for me
   Hillbilly baby my Mountain Rosa Lee
There’s Texas Red in Texas they say she’s out of sight
Pistol Packing Mama full of dynamite
Sadie from Missouri as fine as she can be
But none can satisfy me like my Mountain Rosa Lee
Now you can have your Texas gals and Louisiana Lou
I’ll give you Miss Molly and sweet Sue City Sue
I’ll give you Ann from Old Cheyenne and Marie from Tennessee
I’m going back to the mountains and Marry Rosa Lee

Take me back take me back to my old mountain home
Take me back where my heart longs to be
Where we played by the brook in the cool shady nook
In the mountains of Tennessee
In my old mountain home where the wild roses bloom
Is a spot just like heaven to me
Take me back take me back to my old mountain home
In the mountains of Tennessee
Take me back take me back to my old mountain home
Take me back to my old mothers knee
Where the stars shine bright and the birds are free
In the mountains of Tennessee
Round my old mountain home where I used to roam
Their waiting a welcome for me
Take me back to my old log cabin home
In the mountains of Tennessee

I’m gonna catch me a freight train
Lord I’m leaving this lonesome town
The one I loved and gave my heart to
For someone else she turned me down
   Engineer reach up and pull the whistle
   Let me hear that lonesome sound
   For it blends with the feeling that’s in me
   The one I loved has turned me down
There’s sixteen cars behind each engine
I’ll ride the last one till the end of the line
I don’t know where I’ll go or where I’ll wind up
Just anything to ease my worried mind

Mary grab the baby river’s rising
Muddy water’s taking back the land
Well this old house it won’t take one more beating
Ain’t no use to stay and make a stand.
The morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy’s grave just went below the line
Things to save you just can’t take them with you
The flood will swallow all we leave behind.
   I won’t be back to start all over
    ‘Cause what I felt before is gone
   Mary grab the baby river’s rising
   Muddy water’s taking back our home.
Now the road is gone there’s just one way to leave here.
I’ll turn my back on what I’ve left below
Shifting land and broken farms around me
Muddy water’s changing all I know.
It’s hard to say just what I’m losing
Ain’t never been so all alone
Mary grab the baby river’s rising
Muddy water’s taking back my home.
Well muddy water’s taking back my home.

Good morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line
Well I like to work I’m rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy I’m rolling all the time
I can pop my initials Right on a mule’s behind
Well it’s hey little water boy bring your water ’round
Lord it’s hey little water boy bring your water ’round
And if you don’t like your job just set that water bucket down
I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I’ve got three women on Saturday night Waiting to draw my pay
Well I’m going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I’m going to town baby what can I bring you back
Just bring a pint of good rye And a John B.Stetson hat
Lord it’s raining here and it’s storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it’s raining here and it’s storming on the deep blue sea
Can’t no blonde headed woman make a monkey out for me
If your house catches fire and there ain’t no water ’round
If your house catches fire and there ain’t no water ’round
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
Well I’m leaving here and I ain’t gonna take no clothes
I’m leaving here and I ain’t gonna take no clothes
There may be good times in this old town but it’s better on down the road

In time my aching heart will mend
Through all the sorrow that I’m in
And then I’ll see the light sweetheart
For someone new will take your place
   So I’ll stand up and be brave
   I’ll grieve each minute of the way
   And on the day my tears will dry
   I’ll forget I’ve ever lived this life
I’ve paid the price for loving you
And lived in dreams that could not be
I never thought it’d end this way
But I will smile again someday

   Now you’re back on my doorstep a’ crying
   Like I cried through all those lonely years
   But I can’t dry your tears it’s been too long since love was here
   And I’ve already gave you my better years
And so the pages of time kept right on turning
They never stopped for us to harvest the years
And old embers of love kept right on dying
For there was no one to drown my tears.
But I’ve tried not to blame you
and I try not to shame you
All I can do now is wish you well
But if you should need a friend
I’ll be there until the end
Just don’t ask me to love you again.
   And don’t come back to my doorstep a’ crying
   Hoping for what’s been dead so long
   For the embers have all turned to ashes
   There’s nothing here but old memories and this song.
   No don’t come back to my doorstep a’ crying
   There’s nothing here but old memories and this song.

I walk in the garden where often we met
Think of the one I’ve lost but love yet
The church organ plays for your wedding I learned
My heart is broken the day I returned
Why let me believe that I was the one
Far away I dreamed of you and home
I cherished your letters and pictures inside
Memories sacred helped keep me alive
I face the place where we shared our embrace
How often you promised to be my sweet wife
Emotion chokes me so to see you pass by
And sorrow yes sorrow will mar me for life
When friends gather round them I brush tears aside
I’ll try my best my feelings to hide
How lovely she looks as on by me they ride
My false sweetheart is my brothers bride

I’ll never forget the mornin’ you left me
I tried to smile but instead I cried
I couldn’t hold my tears no longer
The moment you told me good-bye
   My brown eyed darlin’ you know I love you
   I’ll always be faithful and true
   Though tonight you’re miles away dear
   I want you back dear I’ll be true
My darlin’ I hope you’d trust me
‘Cause I’ll be waiting just for you
Night after night upon my bed dear
I try to sleep but I can’t for you
I know I can depend on you dear
I hope that soon you’ll come back home
I’m hopin’ and prayin’ for you my darlin’
And the day I’ll call you my own
 

I’ll never forget the mornin’ you left me
I tried to smile but instead I cried
I couldn’t hold my tears no longer
The moment you told me good-bye
   My brown eyed dar-lin’ you know I love you
   I’ll always be faithful and true
   Though tonight you’re miles away dear
   I want you back dear I’ll be true
My darlin’ I hope you will trust me
‘Cause I’ll be wait-ing just for you
Night after night upon my pillow
I try to sleep but I can’t for you
I know I can depend on you dear
I hope that soon you’ll come back home
I’m hopin’ and prayin’ for you my darlin’
And the day I’ll call you my own

There’s a cabin in the pines in the hills of Caroline
And a blue-eyed girl is waiting there for me
I’ll be going back some day and from her I’ll never stray
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline
   Oh, the cabin in the shadow of the pines
   And the blue-eyed girl way down in Caroline
   Someday she’ll be my wife and we’ll live a happy life
   In a cabin in the hills of Caroline
I’m packing my grip for that long long trip
Back to the hills of Caroline
I want to see that blue-eyed girl, she’s the sweetest in the world
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline
And when it’s late at night, and the moon is shining bright
And the whippoorwill is calling from the hill
Then I’ll tell her of my love, greater than the stars above
How I love her now and I know I always will

Far away upon a hill on a sunny mountain side
Many years ago we parted, my own true love and I From the sunny mountain side 
Oh she clung to me and trembled, when I told her we must part
And she said don’t go my darling I know twill break my heart
When we two are far apart 
   Carry me back to old Virginia back to my clinch mountain home
   Carry me back to old Virginia back to my old mountain home 
My mother’s old and feeble and my father’s getting gray
Carry me back to old Virginia for its there I want to stay 
Oh I held her in my arms leaned her head upon my breast
And I told her that I’d wed her when I come back from the west
To my old clinch mountain home 
In my hand I hold a picture of the old home far away And the picture of my sweetheart
I’m thinking of today
On the sunny mountain side

There’s a little cabin that’s lonely today
And the love that was sheltered has vanished away
Alone now I sit by the old cabin door
And long for the home that I’ll see there no more
I looked at the casket where she lay asleep
But for the one who’s gone it’s useless to weep
The lips that would smile and kiss me each day
Are now still forever God called her away
My darlin’s in heaven she’s happy I know
But each hour that passes I miss her so
The roses are fading she tended with care
And my lonely sorrow is so hard to bear
I just can’t believe that in the old cabin door
My darlin’ will be waiting there no more
The one that I love can’t come back to me
But someday in heaven my darlin’ I’ll see

   Now darling you know that I love you
   And hope you will love me sometime
   Now darling you know that I trust you
   And I hope you will soon change your mind
I wish we were both here together
While I’m writing the words to this song
But if you could write me a letter
Then it wouldn’t seem so very long
Remember when we were together
You said you’d come back some day
I’m saving all my love for you darling
And that’s all that I can ever say
If you ever change your mind dear
And feel that you want someone new
Just tell me all about your little secret
Then I won’t feel so sad and so blue

Now I just heard my darlilng’s last goodbye
Her precious lips can speak to me no more
The teardrops stain my cheeks although I tried
To remember that we’ll meet on heaven’s shore
The vows we said as planned today
So she would know no one could take her place
My love so young and fair was called away
And I’m left an empty life to face
I know someday I’ll leave this empty life
To join my precious sweetheart up on high
‘Til then I’ll bear the sorrow and the strife
For I just heard my darling’s last goodbye

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he’s gone to some far country
And that he no longer cares for me 
 I wish I were a swallow flying
I’d fly to a high and lonesome place
I’d join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face 
 Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all the world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me 
 Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And when the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I’ll lay me down and weep

   My deceitful heart keeps changing its mind
   Hurting everyone but me
   Each time I fall in love it’s soon that I find
   My fickle heart longs to be free
Don’t fall love with me let me warn you from the start
I’m so in love with you but I know I’ll break your heart
Yes I’ll only break your heart
Gee but your wonderful and I’d like to make you mine
But I don’t think my love could ever stand the test of time
Could ever stand the test of time

   My Dixie darling
   Listen to this song I sing
   Beneath the silver moon
   With my banjo right in tune
   My heart is ever true
   I love no one but you
   My Dixie darling
   My Dixie queen
Way down below the Mason Dixie’s line
Down where the honey suckles are entwined
There’s where the southern winds are blowing
There’s where the daisies growing
The girls of the north in the gay finery
Whirling around in the society
Singing a song of Dixie darling
Where I long to be
Going down south to have a big time
See my girl in old Caroline
I’ll drink my booze and do as I please
For all those girls I long to squeeze
Singing songs of Dixie darlings
There’s where I long to be going
Down where the jelly roll growing
With my Dixie queen

I hear the special coming and I’ll be on the blinds
When she pulls out for Dixie on that Mason Dixon line
Now when I left the old home I was not satisfied
When I kissed my love goodbye, she hung her head and cried
I knew a girl in Dixie, she was my childhood pal
She said if I’d quit bummin, that she would be my gal
At night I think about her, she’s always on my mind
And when we played together, she was so good and kind
I’ve travelled this whole world over on freight trains thataway
I’m heading back to Dixie, and there I’ll spend my days
I hear the special coming and I’ll be on the blinds
When she pulls out for Dixie on that Mason Dixon line

   How do I know my youth is all spent?
   My get up and go has got up and went
   In spite of it all, I’m able to grin
   When I think of the places my get up has been
Old age is golden, I think I’ve heard said
But sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed
My ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup
My eyes on the table until I wake up
As sleep dims my vision, I say to myself
Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?
But nations are warring and business is vexed
So I’ll stick around to see what happens next
When I was younger, my slippers were red
I could kick up my heels right over my head
When I was older my slippers were blue
But still I could dance the whole night thru
Now I am old, my slippers are black
I huff to the store and I puff my way back
But never you laugh, I don’t mind at all
I’d rather be huffing than not puff at all
I get up each morning and dust off my wits
Open the paper and read the obits
If I’m not there, I know I’m not dead
So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed

The day’s are so lonely without you by my side
You told me that you loved me but I guess that you lied
If you could see me here sittin’ all alone
You’d think of the love we shared and come back home
Forget that I love you forget that I cried
Leave every memory of me behind
If it’s all over please tell me that it’s true
But darling my heart can’t stop loving you
I waited so long to find a new love
And I know that time will heal my broken heart
But still there’s a thing or two I cannot forget
Just like those words of love that said we never would part

   Oh my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
   I feel a trembling in my knees
   Just to know you’re mine until the end of time
   Makes my heart skip a beat
Well I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right then I never could forget you
You are my every dream come true
Well you came into my life without a warning
Turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You’re my sunshine that comes up every morning
You are my every dream come true

In the distant state of Texas
By the silver Rio Grande
Strolled a couple out one evening
Was two sweethearts hand in hand
Was a rich man’s pretty daughter
And the lad she loved so dear
Though tomorrow they must part for many a year
   My heart’s tonight in Texas
   Though I’m far across the sea
   The band is playing Dixie
   And that’s where I long to be
   Dad says the earl I’ll marry
   But although here is my hand
   My heart’s tonight in Texas
   By the silver Rio Grande
To Europe she was going
To become a lady grand
For her father hoped an
Earl of course she’ll wed
But she went away next morning
And her heart was true to Jack
A letter came one day and this it read
At a stately ball in England
Stood the Texas lass one night
The scenes were all splendid
And the light were dizzyingly bright
The earl knelt beside her
Asking her to be his bride
But her thoughts were by the silver Rio Grande

Got a home in the hills of old Virginia I love still
And it stands near the lonesome pines
And I long to go back to the vine covered shack
Where I left that old mother of mine 
I can still see her there in that old rocking chair
In my home among the hills
And I seem to hear her say why did you go away
From your home among the hills
The pine trees stand alone near my old Virginia home
And that silver hared mother of mine
I can see her smiling face in that old familiar place
In my home among the hills
I’m leaving here today I’m going back to stay
In my home among the hills
How happy we will be near the lonesome pine trees
In my home among the hills

   My home’s across the Blue Ridge Mountain (3X)
   For I never expect to see you any more
How can I keep from crying (3X)
For I never expect to see you any more
Oh how I hate to leave you (3X)
For I never expect to see you any more
I’ll be leaving Monday morning (3X)
For I never expect to see you any more
Rock the baby and feed her candy (3X)
For I never expect to see you any more
Goodbye my little darling (3X)
For I never expect to see you any more

How can I keep from crying ?
How can I keep from crying ?
How can I keep from crying ?
For I never expect to see you anymore
   My home’s across the blue ridge mountains
   My home’s across the blue ridge mountains
   My home’s across the blue ridge mountains
   And I never expect to see you anymore
Oh how I hate to leave you
Oh how I hate to leave you
Oh how I hate to leave you
For I never expect to see you anymore
So goodbye my little darling
So goodbye my little darling
So goodbye my little darling
I never expect to see you anymore

When the sun sets in the west my Honey Lou
Then’s the time I love you best my Honey Lou
Come and look into my eyes
When the moon shines in the skies
I’ll be in paradise my Honey Lou
   Last night I waited long my Honey Lou
   And told the birds my song my Honey Lou
   When the bright and silver moon
   Sheds its soft and mellow light
   I’ll love you more each night my Honey Lou
When the birds have hushed their song my honey Lou
All the twilight shadows on my Honey Lou
My heart forever beats
For my honey gal so sweet
I’ll lay it at your feet my Honey Lou

I wrote to my girl last night
I wrote to my girl last night
I wrote to my girl that I was comin’ home
But my last old dollar is done gone
Oh my last old dollar is done gone
Oh my last old dollar is done gone
Now how can a poor boy get back home
When his last old dollar is done gone
I’ve drank and I’ve rambled around
I’ve drank and I’ve rambled around
Now the time has come when I wanna go home
But my last old dollar is done gone
Now the east bound train is done run
Now the east bound train is done run
Now that train is done run and left me all alone
‘Cause my last old dollar is done gone

My little honeysuckle rose you know I love you
Even though you’re many miles away
You’re a sweetheart so divine and I’ll always call you mine
And I’m hopin’ that we meet again someday
Little honeysuckle rose how I miss you
Darlin’ could you ever forget
Oh the day seemed like years and I’ve shed so many tears
And as I loved you then I love you yet
Among the honeysuckle vines we use to wander
When I was with the girl I loved the best
When you promised to be true I’ll remember dear to you
When I pinned a lovely rose upon your breast
Now I’ll say my last goodbye my little darlin’
The roses for me dear I know you’ll save
After I am dead and gone if that love still linger’s on
There’s honeysuckle vines upon my grave

My little sweetheart of the mountains
With hair as red as anybody’s
And her lips as sweet as honey
She shines like the morning stars
Meet me out in the Blue Ridge Mountains
Underneath the lonesome pine
We’ll settle down up there forever
Mary Jane won’t you be mine
I’m going back to North Carolina
Where the mountain tops are blue
Mary Jane you know I love you
And I’m coming back to you

    My Lord keeps a record of things in the past
    Tells us the story of a life that won’t last
    And when I have reached my heavenly home
    My Lord keeps a record of things gone on
I remember when I was so young
All of the evil things I had done
But now I know my life’s crown is won
My Lord keeps a record of things gone on
Many years have come and they’ve gone
I see King Jesus sitting there in his throne
Flying with the Angels to my heavenly home
My Lord keeps a record of things gone on

My love you lie in the cold cold ground
In a grave not one week old
To kiss once more your cold cold lips
I’d give my weight in gold gold
I’d give my weight in gold
I can’t see clear to leave your side
I never more will roam
I’ll make my bed upon your grave 
A pillow from your stone stone
A pillow from your stone

There is no fire can warm me now
No blanket made of down
The warmth I feel is from your soul
A seeping through the ground ground
A seeping through the ground
And I do not want a house of gold
Or a cold dark cave
I’ll make my home in the musty soil 
That lies around your grave grave
That lies around your grave

Well I can’t abide their laughter
It cuts me like a blade
I prefer the night owl call 
And the rhythm of my spade spade
The rhythm of my spade
Soon I’ll be at your side
Apart we’ll never be
And I won’t hear those above
That make a fool of me me
That make a fool of me

My love you lie in the cold cold ground
In a grave not one week old
To kiss once more your cold cold lips
I’d give my weight in gold gold
I’d give my weight in gold
I can’t see clear to leave your side
I never more will roam
I’ll make my bed upon your grave
A pillow from your stone stone
A pillow from your stone
There is no fire can warm me now
No blanket made of down
The warmth I feel is from your soul
A seeping through the ground ground
A seeping through the ground
And I do not want a house of gold
Or a cold dark cave
I’ll make my home in the musty soil
That lies around your grave grave
That lies around your grave
Well I can’t abide their laughter
It cuts me like a blade
I prefer the night owl call
And the rhythm of my spade spade
The rhythm of my spade
Soon I’ll be at your side
Apart we’ll never be
And I won’t hear those above
That make a fool of me me
That make a fool of me

Sittin’ alone in my cold prison cell
Watchin the sinkin’ sun
My trial on earth is over now
But my main trial is yet to come
   My main trial is yet to come oh Lord
   I’ll die in the morning at dawn
   But after I die in the electric chair
   My main trial is yet to come
Oh mother I’m leavin’ you here all alone
I’ve disgraced your name I know
This trial on earth is for my life
But the main trial will be for my soul
The judge gave me the electric chair
But that don’t worry me
It’s what the verdict will be on that day
When the main judge’s face I see

I’d like to see my native home
The lofty trees, the golden sand
The rugged hills all crowded round
My mother’s voice how sweet would sound
Sometimes I dream of home and friends
My dreams are false my heart is rent
And when I wake I’m all alone
My dreams are false my friends are gone
I’d like to see my heart’s delight
Her beautiful face and eyes so bright
And how she’d smile as I drew near
I’d kiss her with a falling tear
It fills my heart with fondest love
To listen to that lonesome dove
She mourns as if her mate was gone
As if like me left all alone
Nine or ten years have passed and gone
And I’m still left here all alone
Virginia oh my native home
Among your hills I’d love to roam

I’d like to see my native home
The lofty trees the golden sand
The rugged mountains crowded ’round
My mother’s voice how sweet the sound
Sometimes I dream of home and friends
My dreams are false my heart it bends
And when I ‘wake I’m all alone
My dreams are false, my friends are gone
It fills my heart with fondest love
To listen to that lonesome dove
She mourns as if her mate was gone
As if like me left all alone
I’d like to see my hearts desire
Her beautiful face and eyes so bright
And how she’d smile when I drew near
I’d kiss her with a fallen tear
A hard 10 years have past and gone
And still I’m left here all alone
Searching on my native home
Among the hills I love to roam

I am thinking tonight of an old cottage home
That stands on the brow of the hill
Where in life’s early morning I once loved to roam
But now all is quiet and still
   Oh my old cottage home my old cottage home
   That stands on the brow of the hill
   Where in life’s early morning I once loved to roam
   But now all is quiet and still
Many years have gone by since in prayer there I knelt
With dear ones around the old hearth
But my mother’s sweet prayers in my heart still are felt
I’ll treasure them awhile on earth
One by one they have gone from the old cottage home
On earth we shall see them no more
But we’ll meet them again on that beautiful shore
Where partings will come never more

The sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
‘Tis summer, the folks there are gay
The corn top’s ripe and the meadow’s in bloom
While the birds make music all the day 
   So weep no more, my lady
   Oh, weep no more, today
   We’ll sing one song for the my old Kentucky home
   For my old Kentucky home far away 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor
All merry, all happy and bright
By ‘n by hard times come a-knocking at the door
Then my old Kentucky home good night 
They hunt no more for the ‘possum and the coon
On meadow, the hill and the shore
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon
On the bench by that old cabin door
The head must bow and the back will have to bend
Wherever the poor folks may go
A few more days and the trouble will end
In the field where sugar-canes may grow 
A few more days for to tote the weary load
No matter, ’twill never be light
A few more days till we totter on the road
Then my old Kentucky home, good night

I’ve got an old log cabin by the side of the road
And you’re welcome to rest there if you bear a heavy load
There’s a picture of Jesus hanging over my door
And I talk to my Savior from my knees on the floor
Many years I have lived here just struggling along
Once the walls shook with laughter they heard many a song
It seen the joys of my family shared my grief since they’re gone
Kept me dry from the rain weathered many a storm
I’m just an old feeble man now not much father to go
Soon my savior’s gonna call me for He’s often told me so
I’ll just stay in my cabin till I’ve lived my life’s span
And in my Savior’s name I’ll do all that I can
It heard me sing Rock of Ages and the Old Rugged Cross
Heard me pray for many people who’s soul thought was lost
Seen me welcome many strangers who needed help on their way
Will see the angels come for me when I’ve lived my last day

It was on one winter day from my home I went away
Far away from friends and home I longed to roam
But tonight I’m lone and sad just a little homesick lad
And I’m longing for my old Virginia home
   I’m a lad from old Virginia bravely knocking my way back home
   To that cabin home in the mountains never more let me roam
   I’m a lad from old Virginia and I’m coming coming home
   There I’ll settle down forever in my old Virginia home
Since I left that little shack how my mind has wandered back
How mother often prayed for her lad
But from her I went astray and I know I’ve dearly paid
So I’m coming back to mother and my dad

You’ll be hearing stories rumors around town
Of a heart that’s broken and slow to come around
Let them tell their stories well even if they’re true
No one’s going to tell me how to forget about you.
   I’m gonna take my own sweet time
   That’s what I’ll do
   I’m gonna take my own sweet time
   Getting over you.
Daisies love the sunshine and roses love the dew
People try to tell me Go find someone new
Someday I’ll remember to forget we ever met
But until it’s over well I’m not through with you yet.

She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows we’d love each other
And I know we always will
   She’s my rose of old Kentucky
   I watched her bloom as the years roll by
   And to me there’ll never be another
   I’ll love her ’til the day I die
Oh in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more to me
Oh I know you often wonder
So I’ll tell you the reason why
She’s my rose of old Kentucky
And I know she’ll never lie

Come listen to my story
It tells of sorrow and pain
My sinful past still haunts me
I’ve lived my lifetime in vain
 The hand reached down to guide me
The smile was sweet to see
I heard a sinner murmur
Oh Lord, have mercy on me
I’ve lead a life so wicked
I’ve lost all I ever had
That’s why I’m bound for destruction
It’s sinful, it’s shameful and sad

   You’re my sweet blue-eyed darling
   And my love belongs to you
   All I ask (all I ask) of you my darling (my darling)
   Is love me good (is love me good) and be true
Days come and go and I still love you
And I see your smiling face
Just tell me love, that you need me
And no one’s gonna take my place
And today I need an answer
And I want to hear you say
You don’t belong to another
And in my arms you’re gonna to stay

Listen to the rain a fallin’
Can’t you hear that lonesome sound
Oh my poor old heart is breakin’
Cause my sweet love ain’t around
I spent the night out lookin’ for her
Her friends gave me the run around
I’ll go crazy here without her
Cause my sweet love ain’t around
Lord I think i’ll start to ramble
Got to leave this weary town
This old place is way to lonely
Cause my sweet love ain’t around
Babies gone what’s there to live for
My whole world has tumbled down
My hopes and dreams have all been shattered
Cause my sweet love ain’t around
Hold that train tonight i’m leaving
And don’t ask me where i’m bound
I can’t stay here any longer
Cause my sweet love ain’t around

All my life I’ve wondered if what I done was wrong
All I ever cared to do was ride my pony on
I never had no heartache was always happy and gay
Until I met a Texas girl who stole my heart away
   Where the sleepy Rio Grande goes slowly to the sea
   It was there she promised to be mine throughout eternity
   But the angels they grew jealous of her beauty and her smile
   And came along one stormy night and stole away my bride
   The birds have hushed their singing sadness is over the land
   The birds miss my darling by the sleepy Rio Grande
Her lips were like the Russian wine her hair it hung in curls
Her cheeks were like the dawn of day that breaks upon the world
She’s gone and left me lonely I miss the touch of her hand
Tonight while I am walking by the sleepy Rio Grande

My Virginia rose is blooming
She’s waiting there for me
In the hills of old Virginia
That’s where I long to be
She wears a winning’ smile
And her loving eyes are blue
She’s won my heart forever
For she’s the girl that’s true
Beneath the scarlet maple
By the twinkling little spring
That’s where I bid her promise
And gave to her the ring
Springtime is approaching’
The birds and doves are here
They are singing so sweetly
But none can sing like her
It’s love that calls me to you
My rose that never fades
Or loses its crimson leaves of love
Love that’s perfect made
I long to see my darlin’
there in the mist of dew
With the diamond dewdrops all ‘round her
She’ll be a queen in the view
She’s a wild rose in the forest
A fairy in a dream
My darlings in Virginia
her age is just sixteen
I’m a long, long ways from my darlin’
Just a little too far to be
My Virginia rose is blooming
She’s waiting there for me

I’ve got the blues those Nashville blues
I’ve got the blues those Nashville blues
Ain’t got no hat ain’t got no shoes
The people here they treat me fine
The people here they treat me fine
They give me beer they give me wine
I’ve got the blues I’ve got ’em bad
I’ve got the blues I’ve got ’em bad
Somebody stole that girl I had
She’s gone she’s gone away from me
She’s gone she’s gone away from me
One thing she left she left me free
I wish I was a turtle dove
I wish I was a turtle dove
I’d fly away to the girl I love
It’s hard to tell what a girl will do
It’s hard to tell what a girl will do
They’ll win your love and leave you blue
I’m going home to Arkansas
I’m going home to Arkansas
Gonna stay right there with ma and pa
If you find me sad please go away
If you find me sad please go away
Come back again some other day

As a young man I went riding out on the western plain
In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie Kane
I met my Nellie Kane
She was living in a lonely cabin with a son by another man
Five years she had waited for him as long as a woman can
As long as a woman can
   I don’t know what changed my mind
   ‘Til then I was the rambling kind
   The kind of love I can’t explain
   That I had for Nellie Kane
She hired me on to work that day to help her till the land
In the afternoon we planted seeds in the evening we held hands
In the evening we held hands
Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know
It was then I realized that I would never go   
That I would never go
Now many years have gone by and her son has grown up tall
I became a father to him and she became my all
She became my all

The stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love
I thought was true and so divine
   So never again, oh never no more
   Never again will I knock upon your door
   Never again but these words I can say
   I’ll try not to love and stay out of your way
We had the greatest start but deep within your heart
You led me on before I knew the score
You cheated and you lied I stayed right by your side
Until one day simply closed the door

I used to take you in my arms and hold you close to me
I used to tell you how I cared how happy we could be
Bue someone else has won your heart and knocking at your door
And I never get to hold you in my arms anymore
I tried a million times or more to forget about the past
But it seems to me your memories are the ones that always last
I lie awake and cry for you and sometimes walk the floor
But I never get to hold you in my arms anymore
I’ll step aside and give you up although it makes me blue
You’ll never know how much it hurts to see him holding you
I’ll always care and always love you just as before
But I’ll never get to hold you in my arms anymore

My tender parents brought me up
Provided for me well
Twas in the city of Lanson Town
They placed me in a mill
It was there I spied a pretty fair miss
On whom I cast my eye
I asked her if she’d marry me
And she believed a lie
Three weeks ago last Saturday night
Of course it was the day
The devil put it in my mind
To take her life away
I went into her sisters house
At eight o’clock one night
But little did the sister ? think
On her I had my spite
I asked her if she’d take a walk
With me a little ways
That she and I might have a talk
About our wedding day
We walked along until we came
To my little desert place
I grabbed a stick off of the fence
And struck her in the face
I run my fingers through her coal black hair
To cover up my sin
I drug her to the river side
And there I plunged her in
I started back unto my mill
I met my servant John
He asked me why I was so pale
And it so very warm
Come all young men and warning take
Unto your lovers be true
And never let the devil get
The upper hand of you
I met my servant John

Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heart
Time forgets these bitter things I feel
But your days are numbered
you learned your lesson well
When you finally play a heart that plays for real
There’s a new fool somewhere waiting
For you old fashioned heart-break love affair
He’ll see through your intentions
with each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new somewhere
Leavin’ was so easy
but old hands do make fancy moves
Enough for one fell victim to your game
But someday you’ll see
that cold hearts can be broken too
And what goes ’round must come around your way

I have been down a lot of roads in my time
I have taken some bad turns in my life
I wanted to stop all my stumbles and falls
But I kept on rolling and kept on going
   Now I’m riding on a new highway
   I got off Heartbreak Boulevard
   Every mile that I’ve been through
   Each and every avenue
   Has taken me through some rough and rocky days
   Now I’m riding on a new highway
Every crossroad that I’ve taken goes wrong
It’s a good thing that you came along
I knew I was headed down a lonely street
But I kept on trying and kept on driving

John Henry was a little colored boy
You could hold him on the palm of your hand
And his papa cried out this lonesome farewell
Son gonna be a steel drivin’ man Lord Lord
Son gonna be a steel drivin’ man
John Henry went upon the mountain
Looked down on the other side
Lord the mountain was so tall
John Henry was so small
He laid down his hammer and he cried Lord Lord
He laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry walked to the top
Had his captain by his side
The last words that John Henry said
Bring me a cool drink of water ‘fore I die Lord Lord
Bring a cool drink of water ‘fore I die
Talk about John Henry as much as you please
Say and do all that you can
Never was born in these united states
Nonesuch a steel drivin’ man Lord Lord
Nonesuch a steel drivin’ man
John Henry told his captain
I want to go to bed
Fix me a pallet of straw to lay down
Got money roarin’ in my head Lord Lord
Got money roarin’ in my head

Now and then an old friend tries to help me
by telling me theres someone I should meet
But I don’t have the heart to start all over
My heart is laying at anothers feet.
You just don’t put new Patches on old garments
I don’t want no one else on my mind
I just don’t need nobody new to cling too
I still love someone I’ve known a long, long time
I have built my world around a memory
and he’s the only one I’ll let in
Everytime I try to love somebody
in my mind I’m loving him again.
You just don’t put new patches on old garments
I don’t want no one else on my mind
I just don’t need nobody new to cling too
I still love someone I’ve known a long, long time.
I still love someone I’ve known a long, long time.

Night
While everyone is sleeping
Night
These memories have got me weeping
Pretty soon
Daylight will come creeping
Daylight
When I’ll be just as lonely
Daylight
And I’ll be thinking of you only
Night will come
Once again my past will haunt me
Cry
Every night the same old story
Talkin
To my heart but it ignores me
Night
Just darkness before me
Night
Uh-huh
Night
Huh-huh
Night

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, Buddy for my size
   Roll on buddy, don’t you roll so slow
   How can I roll, when the wheels won’t roll
I’m going to the mountain, just to see my baby
And I ain’t coming back, no I ain’t coming back 
There ain’t one hammer, down in this tunnel
That can ring like mine, that can ring like mine
   Rings like silver, shines like gold
   Rings like silver, shines like gold
This old hammer, it killed John Henry
Ain’t gonna kill me, ain’t gonna kill me
It’s a long way to Harlan, and a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little booze, just to get a little booze
Buddy when I’m log gone, won’t you make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold
But one was out on the hills away
Far off from the gates of gold
Away on the mountains wild and bare
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care
Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine
Are they not enough for Thee
But the Shepherd made answer tis this of Mine
Has wandered away from Me
Although the road be rough and steep
I go to the desert to find My sheep
I go to the desert to find My sheep
But all through the mountains thunder-riven
Up from the rocky steep
There arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven
Rejoice I have found My sheep
And the angels echoed around the throne
Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own
Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own
 

I’ve been in this prison twenty years or more
I shot my woman with a 44
I’ll be right here till my dyin’ day
I got 99 years and one dark day
Well the food is bad and the beds are hard
I spend all day breakin’ rocks in the yard
Well there ain’t no change gonna stay that way
I got 99 years and one dark day
Ain’t no singer that can sing a song
Convince that warden that I ain’t wrong
His mind’s made up, gonna stay that way
I got 99 years and one dark day
I never learned to read, I never learned to write
My whole life’s been one big fight
I never heard about the righteous way
I got 99 years and one dark day
I remember a time many years ago
I shot my woman with a 44
I’ll be right here till my dyin’ day
I got 99 years and one dark day
I got 99 years and one dark day

The court room the judge waited there
My mother was crying when I left my chair
The sentence were sharp for it cut like a knife
For ninety nine years folks is almost for life
I dreamed of the whistle I heard the bells ring
My sweetheart was coming some good news to bring
I knew that she loved me and that she’d be true
She said she would save me I’m guilty as you
She went for a pardon or else for parole
I know she’ll come back for she’s part of my soul
If she ever fails me I’ll be mighty blue
I’ll stay in this jailhouse I’ll die in here too
They said I was a criminal and to my despair
They sent me to Nashville and shaved off my hair
So come hear my story I’ll tell you my fate
I’m serving in Nashville for another man’s hate
I just got a letter from Nashville town
And after I read it my spirit broke down
It’s sad that my sweetheart and the judge would be wed
And here in this jailhouse I wish I was dead
No matter how right folks a man he may be
Bad company will send him to prison like me
So take a good woman and make her your wife
For ninety nine years folks is almost for life

I have seen snow that fell in May
And I have seen rain on cloudless days
Somethings are always bound to change
There ain’t no ash will burn
Love is a precious thing I’m told
It burns just like West Virginia coal
But when the fire dies down it’s cold
There ain’t no ash will burn
You say this life is not your lot
Well I can’t be something that I’m not
We can’t stoke a fire that we ain’t got
There ain’t no ash will burn
In every life there comes a time
Where there are no more tears to cry
We must leave something dear behind
There ain’t no ash will burn
There is one lesson I have learned
There ain’t no ash will burn

The storm clouds rise no light in the sky
And my loved ones have gone and left me
There’s glory divine it’s riches are mine
He tells me no burdens pass through
Oh (what a day) what a day (oh what a day)
When the clouds pass away (when the clouds, clouds pass away)
And Jesus supreme on his throne
My tears wiped away (all my tears, tears wiped away)
And the night turns to day (and the night, the nights changed to day)
No burdens are allowed to pass through
There’ll be no sorrow in our new home
No funeral train in the sky
No rent to pay no taxes come due
No burden’s are allowed to pass through
He never fails me when I’m in need
My soul is so weighted with care
He leads me through He helps me to stand
He whispers no burdens pass through

For fear the hearts of men are failing,
For these are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading,
God’s word declared it would be so
   I’m going where there’s no depression,
   To the lovely land that’s free from care
   I’ll leave this world of toil and trouble,
   My home’s in Heaven, I’m going there
In that bright land, there’ll be no hunger,
No orphan children crying for bread,
No weeping widows, toil or struggle,
No shrouds, no coffins, and no death
This dark hour of midnight nearing
And tribulation time will come
The storms will hurl in midnight fear
And sweep lost millions to their doom

I think you’re the sweetest thing and I like your talk
I like your curly hair honey and I like your walk
I like the way you hold me I like your eyes of blue
There’s no doubt it honey I’m in love with you
    Oh when you hold me my poor heart skips a beat
    Mm when you kiss me it knocks me off my feet
    I like your little stories I like everything you do
    There’s no doubt about it I’m crazy over you
I like the way you smile I like your dimpled chin
I like to see you laugh and I like to see you grin
I like the way you hold me I like everything you do
There’s no doubt about it honey I’m in love with you

No answer to my love letter
To sooth my achin heart
Why did God ever permit
True love like ours to part
   No letter in the mail today
   No answer from my love
   Nobody knows what I’ve been through
   No one but God above
This is what I wrote to her
I know I’m to blame
Let me prove my love for you
Then I’ll sign my name
I’m walking down this lonesome road
Travellin while I pine
If there’s no letter in the box
I’ll leave this world behind

Way down upon the old plantation
Old Massey used to own me as a slave
He had a yeller gal he called Lorena
And we courted where the wild bananas waved
For long years there we courted
And we were as happy as one
And my hard work for did Massey
And the happiness of life had just begun
   No more the moon shines on Lorena
   As we’d sit and watch the coons among the corn
   And the possums laying on the wild bananas
   And the old owl a hootin like a horn
One day I called to see my dear Lorena
I thought she would meet me at the gate
But they took her away to old Virginy
And left me to mourn for her fate
For years I have longed to see her
And the thoughts of her was ever in my head
One day Massey read me a letter
Telling me the Lorena she was dead
But I know that her soul has gone to heaven
And there she is ever free from pain
And to her a brighter crown is given
And no more she will wear the darkie’s chain

Way down in old Georgia deep down in the pines
I left my sweet children my home and my wife
I rambled all over this country you see
I wound up a loner out on the high seas
    Out on the high waters where the cold wind blows
    I’ll always be lonesome for the ones I love most
    But beneath the blue waters my body they’ll find
    No more to lonesome for those left behind
She never loved me and pushed me aside
I still long to see her and be by her side
My children are angels and mean all to me
But a dear lovin father she won’t let me be

Now Brother and I are all alone
We have no place to call our home
It will never be like home no more
Till we meet them on that other shore 
   Oh Mother dear and Daddy too
   We wish that we were there with you
   It’s not the same since you’re away
   We’ll see you Mother and Dad some day 
Now Mother and Dad was old you know
It hurt us so to see them go
It’s not the same since they are gone
Oh Mother and Dad we’re so alone
Our little home will tumble down
Since Mother and Dad are not around
What is a home without a friend
I’ll can never go back home again

I went to the old home where I once used to roam
And my playmates had every one gone
How sad and how drear no voice could I hear
There was no one to welcome me there
    No one to welcome me home
    No one to welcome me home
    How sad and how drear no voice could I hear
    There was no one to welcome me there
I wnt to the spring that was flowing so free
And there I drank of water so clear
And sadly this voice seemed to whisper to me
There is no one to welcome you here
    No one to welcome me home
    No one to welcome me home
    But when I behold those mansions above
    There’ll be someone to welcome me home

I’ll never love no one else but my darlin’
Even though we both had to part
I’ll never love no one else but my darlin’
Where ever she goes she’ll always have my heart
As most people say absence makes the heart grow cold
But the kind of love we had each other’s heart will hold
I’ll never love no one else but my darlin’
As we travel down two different lonesome roads
I’ll never let no one take your place my darlin’
For you know you meant the world to me
I’ll never let no one tale your place my darlin’
For your love won’t let my heart be free

Just one year ago today love
I became your happy bride
Changed a mansion for a cottage
To live by the river side
You told me I’d be happy
But no happiness I see
For tonight I am a widow
In the cottage by the sea
   All alone by the seaside he left me
   And no other’s bride I’ll be
   For in bridal flowers he begged me
   In the cottage by the sea
From my cottage by the seaside
I can see my mansion home
I can see those hills and valleys
Where with pleasure I have roamed
The last time that I saw him
Oh how happy then were we
But tonight I am a widow
In the cottage by the sea

Now I can’t wait on baby the smiling merchant said
As stooped and softly toyed with his golden curly head
I want to call up mamma came the answer full and free
Will you telephone and ask her when she’s coming back to me
   My child the merchant murmured as he stroked the anxious brow
   No telephone connection where your mother lives at now
   No telephone in heaven and a tear sprang in her eyes
   I thought God had everything with him up in the sky
Tell her that I get so lonesome that I don’t know what to do
And pappa cries so much I guess he must be lonesome too
Tell her to come to baby cause at night I get so ‘fraid
With no one there to kiss me when the lights begin to fade
All through the day I want her since my dolly’s got so sore
With the awful punching brother give it with his little sword
There aint no one to fix it since mamma’s gone away
And poor little lonesome dolly’s getting thinner every day

   Nobody loves me nobody cares
   If life is empty and full of tears
   I’ve longed for true love searched everywhere
   Nobody loves me nobody cares
Searching for true love has been in vain
Through years my heart has suffered with pain
Life’s lonesome burden now I must bear
Nobody loves me nobody cares
Nights on my pillow I dream of love
Through space I gaze at the stars above
They seem to whisper from way up there
Nobody loves you nobody cares
A lonesome heart and a troubled mind
In this world now is all I find
I look to heaven for I know there
Someone will love me someone will care

That’s where my money goes
To buy my baby clothes
Nobody’s business what I do
Nobody’s business, nobody’s business
Nobody’s business what I do
Sliced ham and pickled feet
Ham and eggs and sausage meat
Nobody’s business what I eat
Nobody’s business, nobody’s business
Nobody’s business what I do
Some day I’ll wake up crazy
Kill my wife and save my baby
Nobody’s business what I do
Nobody’s business, nobody’s business
Nobody’s business what I do
She rides the limousine
I crank the old machine
Nobody’s business what I do
Nobody’s business, nobody’s business
Nobody’s business what I do

Out in this cold world alone
Wandering about on the street
Asking a penny for bread
Begging for something to eat
   I’m nobody’s darling on earth
   Heaven have mercy on me
   For I’m nobody’s darling
   Nobody cares for me
When I was but a young lad
Mother was taken from home
Now I have no one to love me
No one to call me their own
While others are sleeping so sound
Or dreaming of silver and gold
I’m out in this cold world alone
Wandering about in the cold
If I’m fortunate enough
To get to the Heavenly home
I will have some one to love me
Some one to call me their own

   Nobody’s love is like mine
   No one’s as faithful and kind
   Love that is true as the ocean
   Nobody’s love is like mine.
They tell me little darling that you are leaving
That you’re going far away
Why did you leave me little darling
I loved you both night and day.
I guess I’ll just go on dreaming
Wondering why you left me
Someday little darling you’ll be sorry
For the way you treated me.

No not a word no not a word
No not a word from home anyhome
If only I could hear just one little word
From Mother and Daddy my heart would fill with cheer
Each day I take a walk I travel down the trail
Each day the postman tells me no letter in the mail
If only I could hear one little word from home
My heart would be so flattered I never more would roam
The days have turned to weeks the weeks have turned to years
Without one little word from ones I love so dear
The last time Mother wrote they were all okay
But I’m getting worried they’re getting old and gray
Each night I say a player and I always say
I’ll start home tomorrow I can’t live on this way

I
The only love I ever wanted
I lost so many years ago
The Saviour’s called her up to heaven
But I’ll see her some sweet day I know 
    I’ve waited so long for you my darling
   You know out love could be so grand
   I’ve lost the one whose love I cherished
   And now she’s with an angel band. 
 We grew from childhood days together
I knew she’d be mine some sweet day
A lovely flower that was bloomin’
And now my flower’s gone away.

Some people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink wine leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine
   I’d give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
   To hold you closely for just a few hours
   Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
   Would change all the dark clouds to bluest of blue
I don’t drink their champagne and I don’t drink their wine
So if you refuse me my poor heart will pine
I’ll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live dear you’ll still hear me cry

   Oh death, oh death
   Won’t you spare me over til another year
Well what is this that I can’t see With ice cold hands taking hold of me
Well I am death none can excel I’ll open the door to heaven or hell
Whoa death someone would pray Could you wait to call me til another day
The children pray the preacher preached Time and mercy is out of your reach
I’ll fix your feet til you can’t walk I’ll lock your jaw til you can’t talk
I’ll close your eyes so you can’t see This very hour come and go with me
In death I come to take the soul Leave the body and leave it cold
To drop the flesh off of the frame The earth and worms both have a claim
   Oh death, oh death
   Won’t you spare me over til another year
My mother came to my bed Place a cold towel upon my head
My head is warm my feet are cold Death is a movin upon my soul
Oh death how you’re treatin me You close my eyes so I can’t see
Well you’re hurtin my body you make me cold You run my life right out of my soul
Oh death please consider my age Please don’t take me at this stage
My wealth is all at your command If you’ll remove your icy hands
Oh the young the rich or poor All alike to me you know
No wealth no land no silver or gold Nothin satisfies my but your soul
   Oh death, oh death
   Won’t you spare me over til another year
   Won’t you spare me over til another year
   Won’t you spare me over til another year

Everybodys going out and having fun
I’m just a fool for staying home and having none
I cant get over how she set me free
Oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I’m makin by just stayin round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I’ve thought of everything from a to z
Oh lonesome me
I’ll bet she’s not like me
Shes out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother don’t you know
I’d welcome her right back here in my arms
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past and find someone new
I’ve thought of everything from a to z
Oh lonesome me

I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee
I’m going to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Susanna don’t you cry
    Oh Susanna
    Oh don’t you cry for me
    For I come from Alabama
    With my banjo on my knee
I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
A-coming down the hill
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth
The tear was In her eye
Says I I’m coming from the south
Susanna don’t you cry
    Oh Susanna
    Oh don’t you cry for me
    For I come from Alabama
    With my banjo on my knee

I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee
I’m going to Louisiana my true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left the weather it was dry
Sun so hot I froze to death Suzanna don’t you cry
   Oh, Suzanna don’t you cry for me
   I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee
I had a dream the other night when everything was still
I dreamt I saw Suzanna way up on the hill
Buckwheat cakes was in her mouth, the tears was in her eyes
Said I’m a comin from the south Suzanna don’t you cry
I’m headed down to New Orleans and there I’ll look around
And if I do not find Suzanna I’ll fall upon the ground
And if I do not find her then I’ll surely die
And when I’m dead and buried, Suzanna don’t you cry

Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
My good gal left me with a troubling mind
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Gone down behind the mountain and it wont be back till dawn
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Gonna talk to my honey all night long
Oh take me back and try me one more time
Oh take me back and try me one more time
And if I don’t do then send me down the line

Old Bill Jones was a son of a gun
When he got a drink or two
He’d hug the boys and kiss the girls.
He’d kiss their babies too
He lived on a trail that was easy to foller
Way down yonder in Moonshine Holler
He loved his fiddle and he loved his fun
And he loved his mountain dew
Old Bill Jones was a son of a gun
When he got a drink or two
They had a big meetin on the Cumberland Crag
And the people gathered in
The preacher preached till his tongue couldn’t wag
But he couldn’t stop their sin’
When old Bill came to give his greetin’
They all got happy and had a big meetin’
Well old Bill run for sheriff
Against the Prohibition men.
He swore he’d drink the country dry
If the folks would put him in.
I t almost tickled the Wets to death
When the Drys got drunk on old Bill’s breath.
Old Bill went a-courtin’
And his girl got mad and said
Bill Jones, I would not marry you
If all the rest were dead!
He slipped some whiskey in her coffee cup
And she was Mrs. Jones when she woke up.
Liner note says–
I knew this old Bill Jones since I was a boy
and if anything
this song I
wrote
about him is an understatement. He was the kind of man who would do anything
for his friends–and anything to his enemies–and was only afraid of two
things
the rattlesnake and the wild hog. Soon after I met him
he traded his saddle
mule for a Model T and became a “son-of-a-gun on wheels.” His wild days
over
he married
settled down
and raised a family. He studied at night school
and
became a lawyer
then a wise
respected judge. He was to give many a
suspended
sentence to young cutups–fellows like he used to be.

Way down in old Kentucky boys on one winter’s morn
In eighteen forty-seven Old Bill Miner was born
But nothing ever suited Bill at least that’s what they say
And at the age of thirteen years one night he ran away
 
From ranch to California ranch he did his life enjoy
When asked his occupation there he would reply cowboy
With a rocky mountain highway man Bill LeRoy some say
They robbed until LeRoy was hung and old Bill got away
 
In Turkey and in London ‘twas there he could be free
A desert raider a slave trader he soon became you see
Running guns in Rio and South Americae
Then robbing trains in the diamond fields of old North Africae
 
    Hands up boys hold them steady the usual command
    From old Bill Miner the gentleman bandit a six gun in his hand
    Robbing trains all his life he would often say
    Ain’t no jail that can hold me I’ll surely get away
    Oh I’ll surely get away
 
Back home in California he robbed the Sonora state
San Quentin prison and twenty years brought him the middle age
And they let him out for being good in nineteen hundred one
The twentieth century was young he bought himself a gun
 
Upon that mainline CPR he stopped the fast mail train
Got a life in New Westminster Bin in the ol’ Victoria rain
But Bill was good to his word and knew what he was about
Thirty-five feet of tunnel in nineteen seven he dug out
 
 
Head wide so? for Georgia in a manner grand and slow
He robbed the southern rail express his hair was white as snow
Caught by W.A. Minster that persistent Pinkerton man
Tell me now just who you are was his gruff command
 
I am G.W.Edwards a-standing in the mud
George Anderson William Miner or maybe old Bill Mud
Bill broke out of the Georgia bin in the swampy waist-deep water
They hunted him down with dogs and guns for three miles and a quarter
 
And way down south in Milledgeville no hope for a pardon
Old Bill tended to the flowers in the penitentiary garden
But sometimes old memories are all that we can keep
And two years later to the day old Bill died in his sleep

I’m just an old black choo-choo
On a rusty railroad track
They put me in the choo-choo graveyard
And they’re never gonna bring me back
They’re pulling my cars with a diesel
And the diesel sure looks proud
But he’ll never make the sound of a choo-choo
When he blows his whistle loud
    There’s many-many little children
    Can never thrill to my choo-choo sound
    If they don’t put me back upon the railroad
    I’ll never keep on chuggin’ around
    So me fa fa fa so la mi so so fa
    So me fa fa fa so la mi so
    So me fa fa fa so la la
    So me fa fa fa so la
My coat was black and shiny
On the day of my trial run
I’ll never forget how they eyed me
As I glistened in the sun
I’ll be the diesel’s helper
If they’ll only set me free
I’ll blow my whistle at the crossing
Make the diesel proud of me
Well, the black smoke rose in the distance
As the diesel roared  on by
But the coalburner kept on a-chuggin’
As he went on down the line
There’s a new day coming tomorrow
When you won’t hear the whistle scream
You’ll just hear the roar of the diesel
Like the foghorn out at sea

Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay
Gone from this earth to the cotton fields away
Gone from the earth to a better land I know
I hear their gentle voices calling, Old Black Joe
    I’m coming, I’m coming, for my head is bending low
    I hear their gentle voices calling, old black Joe
Why do I weep, when my heart should feel no pain
Why do I sigh when my friends come not again
Grieving for forms now departed long ago
I hear their gentle voices calling, Old Black Joe
Where are the hearts once so happy and so free
The children so dear that I held upon my knee
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go
I hear their gentle voices calling, Old Black Joe

On old Black Mountain, on Saturday night
Mountain boys are doin’ alright
From an old fruit jar they get on the jag
and a hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag
Hey, over there’s a pretty little widder
Bet you five bucks that I’m a-gonna git ‘er
Gonna swing her round the corner and her feet won’t lag
When you’re hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag
When the caller tips in the middle of the floor
Y’all join hands and circle four
A-la-main left and a-la-main right
Swing your honey and you hold her tight
All join hands and circle the wheel
The more you dance then the better you feel
Swing your honey and her feet won’t lag
When you’re hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag
With a homemade fiddle and a shoestring bow
And a little bit of rythm of an old banjo
Give the fiddle a dram, and let it get right
Black Mountain is a rockin’ on Saturday night
Hey, over there’s a pretty little widder
Well I bet you five bucks that I’m a-gonna git ‘er
Gonna swing her round the corner and her feet won’t lag
When you’re hootin’ up a tune called the Black Mountain Rag

There’s a place dear to me where I’m longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With my friends at the old country church
   Precious years precious years, sweet memory
   Oh what joy they bring to me
   How I long once more to be
   With my friends at the old country church
As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
As I knelt at the old country church
There with Jesus above in his wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church
How I wish that today all the people would pray
As they did at the old country church
If they’d only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did at the old country church

Oh my brother take this warning
Don’t let ol Satan take your hand
You’ll be lost in sin forever
You’ll never reach the promised land
   The old crossroads now is waiting
   Which one are you going to take
   One leads down to destruction
   The other to the pearly gate
One road leads up to heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our savior will protect you
He’ll guide you through the old crossroads
Soon your life will be over
You’ll have to face the old crossroads
Will you be ready then my brother
To shun the one down below

Now old Dan Tucker’s fine old man
Washed his face in a fryin’ pan
Combed his head with a wagon wheel
And died with a toothache in his heel
Get out of the way old Dan Tucker
Get out of the way old Dan Tucker
Get out of the way old Dan Tucker
You’re too late to get your supper
Now old Dan Tucker is come to town
Riding a billy goat leading a hound
Hound dog bark and the billy goat jump
Landed Dan Tucker on top of the stump
Now old Dan Tucker he got drunk
Fell in the fire and kicked up a chunk
Red hot coal got in his shoe
And oh my lawd how the ashes flew
Now old Dan Tucker is come to town
Swinging the ladies round and round
First to the right and then to the left
Then to the girl that he loves best
* Refrain
The Deserick Sisters; The National Barn Dance

Young devils find love most every night
They lie with their dreams and their arms til daylight
They use love like whiskey, their cares to dissolve
To charm them and warm them but, not to involve
I was a young devil sturdy and proud
I used to laugh often, I used to laugh loud
I laughed when you told me goodbye that last time
I didn’t know how you’d linger on this old devil’s mind
   Old devils dream, all alone it seems
   Old devils dream all alone
   When their devilment is done
   Their wildest races run
   Old devils dream all alone
Young devils find even they must grow old
Love that was always so warm has grown cold
Their sweet things have vanished and sweet dreams have flown
Sleep when it comes finds them sleeping alone

It’s been ten long years since I left my home
In the hollow where I was born
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
And the foxhunter blows his horn
I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill or two
   What have they done to the old home place
   Why did they tear it down
   And why did I leave the plow in the field
   And look for a job in the town
Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away
Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I’ve lost my love I’ve lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead

There’s a place in old Kentucky where I’m longing to be
Where the bluegrass is growing so fine
Where the dogwoods are in bloom in the mountains so high
Around that old home place of mine
Oh the bluegrass is growing in the valley
And the birds are singing in the trees
That’s where I want to go when I leave this world below
It’s home sweet home to me
Oh the good time I had playin’ as a lad
They often enter my mind
Oh how long my heart did grive that day I had to leave
That dear old home place of mine
I remember Dad and Mom sitting there all alone
That day I left them behind
Oh how my heart does yearn for the day when I’ll return
Back to that old home place of mine

Wished I had a dime
Wished I had a pretty girl
To kiss and call her mine
   Fare thee well old joe clark
   Fare thee well I say
   Fare the well old joe clark
   I’m a goin’ away
I will not marry an old maid
I’ll tell you the reason why
Her neck is so long and stringy
I’m afraid she’ll never die
I asked my girl to marry me
And what do you think she said
Time enough to marry you
When all the rest are dead
Old joe clark did take sick
And what do you think ailed him
He drank a churn of buttermilk
And then his stomach failed him
Old joe clark did get drunk
And not a word could he utter
He fell down on the supper table
And stove his nose in the butter

There’s an old oak tree near the top of the hill
And an old stone chimney close beside
All that’s left to mark the years Of the toil sweat and tears
That we shed on this old kentucky hillside
Goin back in memory to the top of the hill
I hear the wind a blowin through the oak tree with a sigh
I see the children as the play i hear mom and dad pray
Giving thanks to that old Kentucky hillside
    That old kentucky hillside farm
    Where mommy and daddy now lie
    The only crop we ever raised daddy said before he died
    Was the children raised on this old kentucky hillside
At last I return to the top of the hill
And tears of happiness filled my eyes
Here my children will be raised and God forever praised
I’d give everything for this old Kentucky hillside

Today I burned your old love letters
I burned ’em gently one by one
And as I’d light the flame I’d read it
For I could see what you had done
    The first you wrote me was the sweetest
    The last one broke my heart in two
    And as I’d light the flame I’d read it
    For I can say I still love you
And as I burned your old love letters
It brought back memories from the past
It told about you and your new love
A love I knew could never last
 

High on the mountain above the timberline
There lies an old man With a look of death in his eyes
In his one room cabin beside a rocking chair
Lies a hand made fiddle he made with loving care
His hands are weak and trembling his bow is worn and frayed
He thinks of lonesome ballads he’s not strong enough to play
The old man is now in heaven but his fiddle stayed behind
To play a strange and lonesome melody hear it crying through the pines
In his one room cabin beside a rocking chair
Lies a hand made fiddle he made with loving care

   Same old man sitting at the mill
   The mill turns around of its own free will
   Hand in the hopper and the other in the sack
   Ladies step forward and the gents fall back
Down sat an owl and he said all quiet
Lonesome day and a lonesome night
Thought I heard a pretty girl say
Court all night and you sleep next day
Well then, said the raven as she flew
If I was a young one I’d get two
One for to fetch and the other to sew
I’d have a string for my bow, bow, bow
My old man’s in Kalamazoo
He don’t give no “yes, I do”
First to the left and then to the right
This old mill grinds day and night

If you want to get married I’ll tell you where to go
Go to the old man that lives down below
The old folks is gone and the girls all at home
They want to get married with their heads not combed
Children the children are crying for bread
Goin build on a fire just as high as your head
Then you rake in the ashes for to lie in the dough
And the name that you give ’em is dough boy dough
They called me in to supper and I thought I’d go eat
I went to the table for to carve on the meat
I had an old old knife and I had not a fork
I sawed about an hour and I never made a mark
I sawed another hour and I got ‘im in my plate
And the girl said young man I think you better wait
Young man young man you better run
For the old man’s a comin with his double barrel gun
The old man a grinnin as he come a walkin in
Patches on his britches and whiskers on his chin
He had an old hat that he wore the year around
But he had neither hat nor the brim nor the crown 
I stood right there just as brave as a bear
And I wiggled my finger in the old man’s hair
He says young man I think you’re the best
Pull you up a chair boy and sit down and rest
If you want to get married I’ll tell you where to go
Go to the old man that lives down below
The old folks is gone and the girls all at home
They want to get married with their heads not combed

   Old memories mean nothing to me
   They’ve all gone away from me now
   I’m alone in the night it’s plain to see
   And old memories mean nothing to me
It’s the day that I’m thinkin’ of
I’ve forgotten yesterday’s love
So if you don’t love me now set me free
For old memories mean nothing to me
Time has a way of passing by
Over the ruts of our lives it will fly
And if you don’t love me now I can see
And old memories mean nothing to me
I know we once had a fine love
Over others you towered above
But I’m not the playful kind you can see
And old memories mean nothing to me
Del McCoury; Blue Side Of Town

There’s an old, old house that once was a mansion
On a hill overlooking the town
But time has left a wreckage where once there was beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down
But when the leaves start to fall in autumn
And the rain starts to drip from the trees
There’s an old old man who walks in the garden
And his head is bowed in memories
They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
They planned to be married in the fall
But her love for him faded in the last days of summer
And the house stands empty after all

There’s an old old house that once was a mansion
On a hill overlooking the town
But time made a wreckage where once there was beauty
And soon the old house had tumbled down.
But when the leaves start to fall in autumn
And the rain starts to drip from the trees
There’s an old old man who walks through the garden
And his head is bowed in memory.
Well they say he built that mansion for the love of a woman
And they planned to be married in the fall
But her love faded with the last rose of summer
And the house stood empty after all.

when I walked out one morning
Had the wind blowin at my back
As I couldn’t find  no lonesome old road
so I found me an old railroad track
    As I walked down to that old railroad track
    To carry my blues away
    It was say no goodbyes start walkin those ties
    A rambler til my dyin’ day
When I woke up that mornin’
It was I was slippin through the cracks
And the only thing to keep me from goin’ insane
Was my feet on that old railroad track

Rattler was a good old dog as blind as he could be
But every night at suppertime I believe that dog could see
   Here Rattler here here Rattler here
   Call old Rattler from the barn here Rattler here
Rattler breaked the other night I thought he treed a coon
When I come to find him he’s barkin’ at the moon
Rattler was a friendly dog even though he was blind
He wouldn’t hurt a living thing he was so very kind
One night I saw a big fat coon climb into a tree
I called Ol’ Rattler right away to fetch him down for me
But Rattler wouldn’t fetch for me because he liked that coon
I saw them walking paw in paw later by the light of the moon
Grandpa had a muley cow muley since she was born
It took a jaybird forty years to fly from horn to horn
Now old Rattler’s dead and gone like all the good dogs do
Don’t put on the dog yourself or you’ll be going there too

Old river you’re wide, you’re deep and your cold
You make a lonesome old sound as onward you roll
‘Neath the crest of your waves I know I could sleep
And forget all the sorrows you brought to me
Many’s the time and many’s the night
We sat there talkin’, makin’ things right
You’ve heard all our vows, you’ve heard all our plans
Oh river I know that you’ll understand
The dawn is breakin’ on sea and on land
As I write my farewell upon your sand
Your wings will embrace me, my body you’ll claim
Oh river oh river you’re calling my name
Oh the ways of love is often times cold
Like the hearts of lovers, when love grows cold
River oh river your depths dark and deep
In a watery grave forever I’ll sleep

Living in the world of mass confusion
Where contentment’s hard to find
Living in the days of revelation
With old Satan close behind
I’ve been talked about and laughed at
I’ve been locked out in the cold
But I don’t aim to give ol Satan
Any claim upon my soul
You’d better look around you’d better look around
You’d better be wondering what salvation’s all about
You better believe and understand before old Satan takes your hand
He’s gonna take you but it ain’t gonna be to the promised land
When your friends all turn against you
Even though you’ve done your best
Say a prayer and keep on trying
And let the good Lord do the rest
When temptations all around you
And you feel like turnin’ back
Just remember that old Satan’s
Right there breathin’ down your back

My old scrapbook is hidden away
I kept in memory of you
This old scrapbook is just a bouquet
Of things that we used to do
   Memories haunt me each night in my dreams
   It seems I can still see you there
   Your loving arms held out to me
   And smiling so sweet and so fair
Don’t you remember the hours we spent
Swinging on the old swinging bridge
From June to December together we went
Swinging on the old swinging bridge
We built a dream across the old mill stream
And though the years have gone by
I’ll still keep remembering here in my heart
And wonder if you wonder why

Old train I can hear your whistle blow
But I won’t be jumping on again
Old train I’ve been everywhere you go
And I know what lies beyond each bend.
   Old train each time you pass you’re older than the last
   And it seems I’m too old for running
   I hear your rusty wheels grate against the rails
   They cry with every mile and I think I’ll stay awhile.
Old train I grow weary from the miles
And I’ll miss the freedom that was mine
Old train just to think about those times
I’ll smile when you’re high-balling by.

In that dear old village churchyard
I can see a mossy ground
That is where my mother’s sleeping
In the cold and silent ground
I was young but I remember
When the night my mother died
There I saw her spirit fading
When she called me to her side
Saying Darlin I must leave you
Angels voices guide you home
Pray that we may meet in heaven
When your mother’s dead and gone
Oft I wander to the churchyard
Flowers to plant with tender care
On the grave of my dear mother
Darkness finds me weeping there
Looking at the stars above me
Waitin for an early dawn
There by mother I’ll be buried
And no more be left alone

High on a mountain, tell me what do you see
Bear tracks bear tracks looking back at me
Better get your rifles before its too late
The bear’s got a little pig and he’s headed for the gate
   He’s big around the middle and broad across the rump
   Running ninety miles an hour, taking thirty feet a jump
   Ain’t never been caught, he ain’t never been treed
   And some folks say he looks a lot like me
Saved up my money and bought me some bees
Started making honey way up in the trees
Cut down the trees but the honey’s all gone
Old slew foot has done made himself at home
Winter’s coming on and it’s forty below
River’s froze over, so where can he go
I’ll chase him up the gully and run him in the well
Shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell

I’ll tell you a story about omie wise
How she was deluded by john lewis’ lies
He told her to meet him by adam’s spring
He’d bring her some money and other fine things
He brought her no money nor no other fine things
But get up behind me omie to squire ellis we’ll go
She got up behind him so carefully they did go
They rode till they came where deep waters did flow
John lewis he concluded to tell her his mind
John lewis he concluded to leave her behind
Take pity on my infant and spare me my life
And I will go distracted and never be your wife
He kicked her and choked her and turned her around
He threw her in deep water where he knew she would drown
John lewis He remounted rode back to adam’s farm
Inquiring after omie but she was not at home
John lewis was taken prisoner and locked up in jail
Locked up in jail there to remain for a while
John lewis he stayed there for about six months or more
Then he broke jail Into the army he did go

On a hill lone and gray
In a land far away
In a country beyond the blue sea
Where beneath that far sky
Went a man for to die
For the world and for you and for me
   Oh it bows down my heart
   And the tear drops do start
   When in memory that gray hill I see
   It was there on its side
   Jesus suffered yes he died
   To redeem a poor sinner like me
Oft I hear the dull blow
Of the hammer swung low
They are nailing my lord to the tree
With the cross he upraised
While the multitude gazed
He ascended that hill lone and gray
   Oh it bows down my heart
   And the tear drops do start
   When in memory that gray hill I see
   It was there on its side
   Jesus suffered yes he died
   To redeem a poor sinner like me
   
   Shout aloud to them I’m told
   Let the glad tidings roll
   From the land to the end of the sea
   Where beneath that far sky
   Went a man for to die
   For the world and for you and for me

Traveling down this long lonesome highway
I’m so lonesome I could cry
With memories of how we once loved each other
And now you are saying good-bye
   On and on I’ll follow my darling
   And I wonder where she can be
   On and on I’ll follow my darling
   I wonder if she ever thinks of me
I’ve cried I’ve cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear you name
My friends they all so loved you my darling
And they think that I’m to blame
I had to follow you little darling
I can’t sleep when the sun goes down
Cause by your side is my destination
The road is clear and there’s where I’m bound

I can’t sleep and I can’t eat all I do is sit and cry
And listen for your footsteps at my door
I keep asking myself why that you ever said goodbye
And I guess I’ve cried a million tears or more
   On my mind on my mind
   You’re always in my heart and on my mind
   Once I thought my love would die darling here’s what I find
   You’re always in my heart and on my mind
Seems I miss you most of all when the twilight shadows fall
What a fool I was to ever let you go
If longing for you now could only bring you back somehow
You’d be here in these loving arms I know

Back in the days of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the fox hounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills
   I’m on my way back to the old home,
   That road winds on up the hill
   But there’s no light in the window,
   That shined long ago where I lived
Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For my mom and dad were called to heaven
I was left in this world all alone
High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest part of my memory
I’m on my way back to the old home
That light in the window I long to see

I’m on my way to Canaan’s land
I’m on my way to Canaan’s land
I’m on my way to Canaan’s land
I’m on my way (praise God) I’m on my way
If father wont go it wont hinder me
If father wont go it wont hinder me
If father wont go it wont hinder me
I’m on my way (praise God) I’m on my way
If mother wont go it wont hinder me
If sister wont go it wont hinder me
Oh be baptized in Jesus name
I’m on my way to Canaan’s land

I walked out to the graveyard
Down by the Church of God
I looked upon the one I love
That would soon be covered with sod
   Up along the Ohio River
   Over on the old Kentucky shore
   Once dwelled a fair young maiden
   Now there’s a crepe upon her door
The angels took my darling
God needed the one I loved
I reached the old Kentucky shore today
I’ll make my plans and meet her up above
The last words that my darling said
Was tell the one I love goodbye
I would like to see him before I go
But I’ll meet him in the sky

Am I a soldier of the cross
A follower of the lamb
And shall I fear to own His cause
Or blush to speak His name
   On the sea (the sea the sea)
   Of Galilee (of Galilee)
   My Jesus is walking on the sea
   On the sea (the sea the sea)
   Of Galilee (of Galilee)
   My Jesus is walking on the sea
Must I be carried to the sky
On flowery beds of ease
While others false do win the prize
And sail through bloody seas
There shall I take my weary soul
In seas of heavenly rest
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast

Once more to be with you,dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I’d give a fortune
If I could see you once more 
   Forget the past, this hurt can’t last
   Oh I don’t want it to keep us apart
   Your love I’ll crave I’ll be your slave
   If you’ll just give me all of your heart

I have never have seen the face of my savior
But serving him has been such a thrill
I never have seen the gates to the city
But one day one day I will
Since the day I first met him he has been all to me
And my life with joy he has filled
And i’m longing for the day when my eyes shall behold him
But one day one day I will
   One day I’m gonna walk on the streets of pure gold
   And they’ll tell me the half that’s never yet been told
   I’ll be united with my loved ones on Zion’s holy hill
   But one day one day I will
I have never have seen the face of my savior
But serving him has been such a thrill
I never have seen the gates to the city
But one day one day I will

I never have seen the face of my Savior
But serving Him has been such a thrill
I never have seen the gates to the city
But one day one day I will
One day I’m gonna walk on the streets of pure gold
And they tell me that half has never yet been told
I’ll be united with my loved ones on Zion’s holy hill
But one day one day I will
Since the day I first met Him He has been all to me
And my life with joy He has filled
And I’m longing for the day when my eyes will behold Him
But one day one day I will

I don’t know I don’t know where I’ll go or what I’ll do
It makes no difference what I’ll do without you
Oh I love you my darling but I’ll try and let you be
Goodbye, it’s the last you’ll hear of me
   Well I found a bluebird high on a mountain side
   And the bluebird would sing it’s little song
   So I’ll sigh, I’ll cry, I’ll even want to die
   For the one I love is gone

The dream of love is over
Today we said goodbye
We parted not in anger
Though tears came in her eyes
Twas just as fate decreed dear
That we must never wed
Yet in her heart she loved me
She married wealth instead
   One little word could change my future life
   One little word could have made her my wife
   Too late too late now my fondest hopes are dead
   One little word that word was never said
In school days we had been sweethearts
She was her father’s pride
Her folks lived in a mansion
Our cottage by its side
Though years have brought their changes
The same old love still holds
She wed to please her parents
A man of wealth and gold

A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
I missed those hills with the windy pines
For their song seemed to suit me
I sent my wages to my home
Said we’d soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
I’ll be coming home forever
   One more dime to show for my day
   One more dollar and I’m on my way
   When I reach those hills boys I’ll never roam
   One more dollar and I’m going home
No work said the boss at the bunk house door
There’s a freeze on the branches
When the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me

One morning one morning in May
I spied a young couple a making their way
One was a maiden so bright and so fair
The other was a soldier and a brave volunteer
Good morning good morning good morning to thee
Oh where are you going my pretty lady
I am a going to the banks of the sea
To see the waters gliding herar the nightingales sing
Oh they hadn’t been a standing but a minute or two
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune he was playing made the valleys all ring
Oh see the waters gliding hear the nightingales sing
Pretty lady pretty lady it’s time to give oar
Oh no pretty soldier please play one tune more
For I’d rather hear your fiddle and the touch of one string
Than to see that waters gliding hear the nightingales sing
Pretty soldier pretty soldier will you marry me
Oh no pretty lady that never can be
I have a wife in old London and children twa three
Two wives in the army too many for me
Well I’ll go back to London and I’ll stay there one year
And often I’ll think of you my little dear
And when I return it will be in the spring
To see the waters gliding hear the nightingales sing

Well it’s all over town how you been runnin’ round
You stay out every night till two or three
If you leave me here to cry good lord I don’t know why
You ever made those sacred vows with me
   Can’t you understand my dear I thought I made it clear
   I never thought it would end in one short year
Well I try to understand why you love another man
I try to understand but I don’t
We had a life all planned you took another stand
Now I beg you to come back but you won’t
Just a year ago today you vowed you would stay
You’re empty words still torture my mind
Our love was meant to last you put it in the past
Do you think about the love you left behind

They say I got a one track mind and I’ll admit it’s true
So many women on my mind I got no time for you
There’s a different sweetie every night I’m a workin’ overtime
Can’t concentrate on nothin’ else I got a one track mind
   One track mind all the time
   Don’t like you chasin’ after me I’m a leavin’ you behind
   Yonder lies a greener grass so don’t expect me back
   They say I’ve got a one track mind and I’m on the right track
Well I’m not hard to satisfy but you gotta treat me right
I just want a different girl each day and three or four each night
Don’t make me lose my temper I don’t want to be unkind
Don’t think that you can tie me down I got a one track mind
I think it’s time to call an end to our little episode
I been tied down a bit too long it’s time to hit the road
A rollin’ stone won’t rest alone that’s what I always find
Don’t blame me don’t blame yourself blame that one track mind

There’s no use in denying the tears you’ve been crying
Tell me have you made up your mind?
It seems all I can do is bring trouble to you
It was only a matter of time.
   Now that you’re leaving me darling
   How slowly the hours pass me by
   Thought I could love you forever
   But it was only a matter of time.
Had I known from the start I’d only break your heart
Well darling I would have set you free
But a love that is wrong can only last so long
Before it fades to memory.

There’s a town not far from here
Lived a maiden sweet and fair
And a lad that loved her better than his life
He was pleading every way
Just to have her name the day
That he might claim her for his little wife
When on the streets they meet
A question he’d repeat
She would laugh and turn her little face away
Till he saw with grief and pain
That his pleadings were in vain
In a jealous rage she softly heard him say
   You are the only girl I ever cared about
   You are the one I love and cannot live without
   Won’t you brighten up my life
   Come and be my little wife
   You are the only girl I ever cared about
She never seen his face no more
Till one day he passed her door
Another girl was walking by his side
They seemed so bright and gay
As they strolled along the way
In a jealous rage she turned away and cried,
He has gone beyond recall
And I love him after all!
When she met the couple on the street next day
He called on her to wait
Introduced his cousin, Kate
Now she’s happy ‘cause she softly heard him say

I have always held a second place
In a heart that I loved so dear
Waiting oh so long just to see a trace
Or a tiny sign that you care
   They say that time will heal a broken heart
   And I prayed that you’d love me too
   But I just can’t play that second part
   Only the leading role will do
You had another love before I came along
How she hurt you I just don’t know
I can’t fill the shoes of your other love
So for God’s sake let me go
No I just can’t let play that second part
Lord knows I’ve tried not to let it show
Either love me now take me in your heart
Or for God’s sake let me go

I’ve been driftin’ I’ve been stealin’
I’ve been lonesome I’ve been talkin’
To myself and I ain’t got much to say
I’m tired of stories and I’ve heard them anyway
All those people slippin’ by me
Got a place that they call home
I’ve got nothing but my longin’
And these hands to call my own
How far am I from where I began yesterday ?
How much father do I have to roam ?
I guess I’m weary of travelin’
And drinking my pay but I’m scared of the only way home

I’m so lonesome and alone since you left our happy home
Now all that’s left are these tears upon my face
I’ve turned to drinkin’ and prayin’ that the lord would hear me sayin
take me away from this sad and lonely place
   I’ve got no plans for tomorrow
   I’m so ashamed and filled with sorrow
   I should have told you that I loved you everyday
   The only way to say goodbye is with these tears that fill my eyes
   I hear you call me as they fall upon your grave
If I could only be set free from your haunting memory
But still I find that I’m a prisoner of your love
There’s nothing left for me to do but in this pain of losin’ you
So I am down upon the ground I’ve had enough
Not knowin where to turn from here
My heart still yearns for you my dear
I can’t take this awful pain I’m goin through
I’ll take this gun in tremblin hand and hope the lord will understand
There’s just no way that I could stay here without you

I am an orphan on God’s highway
But I’ll share my troubles if you go my way
I have no mother no father
No sister no brother
I am an orphan girl
I have had friendships pure and golden
But the ties of kinship I have not known them
I know no mother no father
No sister no brother
I am an orphan girl
But when He calls me I will be able
To meet my family at God’s table
I’ll meet my mother my father
My sister my brother
No more orphan girl
Blessed Savior make me willing
And walk beside me until I’m with them
Be my mother my father
My sister my brother
I am an orphan girl

God he sent a loving angel
And he called our darlin home
For he needed another flower
To live around the shinin throne
But we know that he is happy
Since he left this world below
for he saw his home in heaven
Just before he had to go
Now he left our home so lonely
Loneliness no one could know
But we ask God to watch o’er us
And give us comfort to our soul
He’s at rest in a lonely mountain
In a deep and a narrow grave
And we thank our loving Savior
For the comfort that he gave
Now we’re here so sad and lonely
In the wicked world alone
Just a widow and poor orphan
In our little mountain home

God He sent a loving angel
And he called our darling home
For he needed another flower
To bloom around the shining throne
But we know that he is happy
Since he left this world below
For he saw his home in heaven
Just before he had to go
He has left our home so lonely
Loneliness you could not know
But we ask that he watch o’er us
And give comfort to our soul
He’s at rest on a lonely mountain
In a deep and narrow gave
And we thank our loving savior
For the comfort that he gave
Now we’re here so sad and lonely
In this wicked world alone
Just a window and poor orphans
In our little mountain home

Oh the nights are lonely here without you
All I see is grief and pain
For another’s love you treasure
All my hopes are now in vain
   For I love you as no other
   Though you’ve gone far away
   Will you ever think my darling
   Of our last goodbye today
 I often dream of you my darling
You looked so sweet and smiled at me
And though another’s arms may hold you
Those two blue eyes I long to see
Now if you ever need me darling
Don’t forget to drop a line
My heart will be with you my darling
Won’t you think of me sometime

Out in the cold world and far away home
Some mother’s boy is wandering all alone
With no one to guide him or keep his footsteps right
Some mother’s boy is homeless tonight 
   Bring back to me my wandering boy
   For there is no other who’s bound to give me joy
   Tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
   Is at the old home awaiting him there 
Out in the hallway, there stands a vacant chair
An old pair of shoes that he used to wear
Empty is the cradle he used to love so well
Oh, how I miss him no tongue can tell 
Well I remember those parting words he said
We’ll meet up yonder where tears are never shed
In that land of sunshine away from toil and care
When life is over, I’ll meet you up there

I am sailing out on the ocean
Many miles from home on sea
And I wonder little darlin
If you ever think of me
I am just on old true lover
Roaming through this world alone
And I have no one to love me
Through this life I’ll always own
I was once carefree and happy
When I won my sweetheart’s hand
And now my life is empty
Since she’s wed another man
Do you remember little darlin
Just how much I cared for you
And you told me that you loved me
But you proved to be untrue
I am travelling far away dear
Many miles from this old place
And I know I’ll never forget you
Your sweet smiles and happy face
I can hear my mother calling
I can see my father pray
If I’d listened to my father
I would be at home today

I’ve a home prepared where the saints abide
Over in the glory land
And I long to be by my Savior’s side
Just over in the glory land
   Just over ( over ) in the glory land
   I’ll join ( yes join ) the happy angel band
   Just over in the glory land
   Just over ( over ) in the glory land
   There with ( yes with ) the mighty host I’ll stand
   Just over in the glory land
I am on my way to those mansions fair
Just over in the glory land
There to sing God’s praises and his glory share
Just over in the glory land
What a joyful thought that my Lord I’ll see
Just over in the glory land
And with kindred saved there forever be
Just over in the glory land
With the blood washed throng I will shout and sing
Just over in the glory land
Glad hosannas to Christ
the Lord and King
Just over in the glory land

I’ve a home prepared where the saints abide
Over in the glory land
I long to be by my Saviors side
Over in the glory land
   Just over in the glory land
   I’ll join (yes join) the happy angels band
   Over in the glory land
   Just over in the glory land
   There with (yes with) the mighty host I’ll stand
   Over in the glory land
I’m on my way to those mansions fair
Over in the glory land
There to sing Gods praise and his glory share
Over in the glory land
What a joyful thought that my Lord Ill see
Over in the glory land
And the kindred say there forever I’ll be
Over in the glory land

My love stood under a walnut tree
Over the garden wall
She whispered and said she’d be true to me
Over the garden wall
She had beautiful eyes and beautiful hair
She wasn’t very tall so she stood on a chair
Many is the time I kissed her there
Over the garden wall
Over the garden wall
The sweetest girl of all
There never was yet such eyes of jet
And you can bet I’ll never forget
The night our lips in kisses met
Over the garden wall
There’s always a will there’s always a way
Over the garden wall
There’s always a night as well as a day
Over the garden wall
We hadn’t much money, but weddings were cheap
So while the old feller was snoring asleep
With her lad and her ladder she managed to creep
Over the garden wall

Over the sunset hill you have gone
You’ve fought life’s battles and victory won
You’ve toiled an suffered through lonely years
You’ve shared our sorrow, our joys and tears
    Over the sunset hill you have gone
    Leavin fond memories to linger on
    Our lovin master called your name
    The chariots swung low and the angels came
You’ve carried your cross and won your crown
You’ve bore life’s burden without a frown
You’ve laughed and smiled though feeble and weak
You’ve asked one and all the savior to seek

Over yonder in the graveyard
Where the wild wild flowers grow
Oh there they laid my own true lover
She’s gone from me forever more
Fairer than the sweetest flowers
Restless as a wildest wind
Born with love deep as the ocean
This is the girl that I did win
I left her there back in the mountains
To see the world riches to gain
When I returned no earthly treasure
Could ease this heart so full of pain
There so high upon that mountain
Beneath that little mound of clay
Oh the girl that I’d returned to marry
So still among the flowers did lay
I’ll go away and I will wander
Lay aside my earthly gains
And I’ll not end as a man with riches
Undone in sorry I’ll remain

When I first I met you, right from the start
You knew that I loved you, from the pain in my heart
So look in my eyes and see that it’s true
And say that you love me, please don’t make me blue
   With a pain in my heart and blues on my mind
   I’ll always love you but can you be mine
   Can you be mine with another man’s name
   You know that I love you and I’m not to blame
Say that you love me and you will be mine
With a pain in your heart and blues on your mind
Please say that you love me and don’t say goodbye
You know that I love you, for you I would die

   Listen poor sinner you’re drifting away
   From the dear Savior who’s pleading today
   What will you do if the Savior was nigh
   When the pale horse and his rider go by
The time is not long when the Savior will come
Then you’ll be judged by the deeds you have done
On judgment day you’ll weep and you’ll cry
When the pale horse and his rider go by
Soften your heart and turn from all sin
For Jesus is waiting to welcome you in
There’s coming a time you’ll wish He was nigh
When the pale horse and his rider go by
Won’t you redeem your poor wicked soul
You can’t pay your way with silver and gold
If you’re not saved you’ll be lost in the night
When the pale horse and his rider go by

Make me a pallet on your floor
Make me a pallet on your floor
When I reach Atlanta and got no place to go
Make me a pallet on your floor
These blues are every where I see
weary blues are every where I see
Blues are all around me every where I see
Nobody’s had these blues as bad as me
Come on all you good time friends of mine
Ooh Come on all you good time friends of mine
When I had a dollar you treated me so fine
Where’d you go when I only have a dime
I’d be more than satisfied
To hop on a old freight train and ride
But when I reach Atlanta and got no place to go
Won’t you make me a pallet on your floor

When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there’s a backwards old town that’s often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn.
   And daddy won’t you take me back to Muhlenberg County
   Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
   Well I’m sorry my son but you’re too late in asking
   Mister Peabody’s coal train has hauled it away
Well sometimes we’d travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we’d shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.
Then the coal company came with the world’s largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.
When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I’ll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waiting
Just five miles away from wherever I am.

   PARDON ME BUT I THINK YOU’RE THE ONE LOVE
   THAT I’VE BEEN WAITING ON FOR SO LONG
   PARDON ME COULD WE WALK IN THE MOONLIGHT
   JUST TO SIT THERE AND FIND RIGHT OR WRONG
WELL I’VE MET A LOT OF BOYS IN MY LIFETIME
BUT I’VE NEVER HAD A ROMANCE WITH NONE
I’M JUST WAITING FOR SOMEONE REAL SPECIAL
PARDON ME BUT I THINK YOU’RE THE ONE
PARDON ME BUT SOME NICE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
FROM THE MOMENT YOU WALKED IN THE DOOR
IT JUST SEEMS THAT MY DREAMS HAVE ALL COME TRUE DEAR
AND I’VE NEVER HAD THIS FEELING BEFORE
I BELIEVE I COULD SEARCH THIS WORLD OVER
AND NEVER FIND ONE SWEETER THAN YOU
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU’RE READY AND WILLING
JUST TO MAKE MY EVERY DREAM COME TRUE

Pass me not oh gentle savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others Thou art calling
Do not pass me by
   Savior Savior
   Hear my humble cry
   While on others Thou art calling
   Do not pass me by
Let me at the throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief
Kneeling there in deep contrition
Help my unbelief

Paul and Silas bound in jail all night long (3X)
Saying who shall deliver for me
Paul and Silas prayed to God all night long (3X)
Saying who shall deliver for me
That old jailor locked the jail all night long (3X)
Saying who shall deliver for me
That old jail it reeled and rocked all night long (3X)
Saying who shall deliver for me
Hebrew children in the burning fire all night long (3X)
Saying who shall deliver for me

In eighteen hundred one peg and awl
In eighteen hundred one
Peggin’ shoes was all I done

Peggin’ shoes is all I’d do
I’m gonna lay me down my awl my peg and awl

In eighteen hundred four
Peggin’ shoes I’ll do no more
I’m gonna lay me down my awl my peg and awl

These petals that I got here in my pocket
Or the words I said while waiting here alone
Each brought me different pictures of our future
Back and forth in love two lives here alone
    Please tell me flower that she loves me
    Don’t say she never will be mine
    These games we play won’t last forever
    And neither will the love I thought was Mine
The flower that I picked was full dear
Then one by one it’s beauty disappeared
What’s left now is a bud that’s soon forgotten
Standing all alone in the meadow there

You were mine for just a while now you’re puttin’ on the style
You never once looked back at your home across the track
You’re the gossip of the town but my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground pick me up on your way down
   Pick me up on your way down when you’re blue and all alone
   When their glamor starts to bore you come on back where you belong
   You may be their pride and joy But they’ll find another toy
    And they’ll take away your crown pick me up on your way down
They have changed your attitude made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame underneath you’re still the same
When you find these things are true I’ll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground pick me up on your way down

There’s an old and faded picture on the wall
That has been a hanging there for many years
It’s a picture my mother
For I know there is no other
That can take the place of mother on the wall
   On the wall (on the wall) on the wall (on the wall)
   How I love that dear old picture on the wall
   Time is swiftly passing by
   And I bow my head and cry
   Cause I know I’ll see my mother after all
Yes the children all have gathered all have gone
And I have a little family of my own
And I know I love them well
More than any tongue can tell
But I’ll hold that dear old picture on the wall
Since I lost that dear old mother years ago
There is none to which with troubles I can go
As my guitar makes its chords
I am praying to the Lord
Let me hold that dear old picture on the wall

   I got a pig at home in a pen corn to feed ‘im on
   All I need is a pretty little girl to feed ‘im when I’m gone.
Goin’ on the mountain to sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of Sorghum sweet lil’ Liza Jane.
Black cloud’s a-risin’ surest sign of rain
Get the old grey bonnet on Little Liza Jane.
Yonder comes that gal of mine how you think I know
Can tell by that Gingham gown hangin’ down so low.
Bake them biscuits baby bake ’em good n’ brown
When you get them biscuits baked we’re Alabamy bound.
When she sees me comin’ she wrings her hands and cries
Yonder comes the sweetest boy that ever lived or died.
Now when she sees me leavin’she wrings her hands and cries
Yonder goes the meanest boy that ever lived or died.

I know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I’m here without you
And there’s pins and needles in my heart
The days and nights are growing longer
Since first you said that we must part
But now I know I can’t forget you
With pins and needles in my heart
I always see your face before me
Your smile is heaven’s work of art
But now you’re smiling at another
And there’s pins and needles in my heart
Someday somewhere I know I’ll find you
And love will make the teardrops start
And then you’ll know how long I’ve waited
With these pins and needles in my heart

   Plant some flowers by my graveside
   Just a little bunch of them
   Makes no difference what they are, dear
   Since your hand has planted them 
Darlin’, when you pass the graveside
You see my name there on a slab
Won’t you stop a little while dear
For I would be lonesome there 
You will do this won’t you darlin’
You will do this last request
You will do this won’t you darlin’
When they lay me down to rest

I am lonely tonight little pal
I’m lonely I’m sad and I’m blue
There an empty spot in my life
That no one can fill only you
So please come back little pal
Please come and stay
My heart is withered like a petal
Of a rose I saw dying today
Remember we walked in the moonlight
We walked we talked alone
Was the night that we were parting
And never again would we roam
Please think of me little pal
For I surely am thinking of you
You’re the only pal that ever
Was to me so kind and so true

    Please don’t wake me tonight while I’m sleepin
    For I might have the same dream again
    Let me own the whole world for just a moment
    While I hold you in my arms once again
Last night I had a dream about you darlin
Happy tears filled my eyes when I held you
When I awoke and realized I was dreamin
Happy tears that filled my eyes had turned to blue
I know that’s the only way I can hold you
I realize that you belong to someone new
Let me dream and think that you are still mine dear
For you know that I’ve always worshiped you

Please remember that I love you
And I hope you’ll not forget
Each hour each day our love grows stronger
Since the day that we first met
Nothing now can separate us
Nothing but the end of time
Please remember that I love you
Don’t forget that you’re all mine
When I’m holding you so close dear
Lips so sweet brush close to mine
Time stands still my world is brighter
By a love that’s so sublime
Please remember that I love you
That no one can take away
All the vows we made together
Are locked in my heart to stay

Please search your heart and maybe you’ll find
A reason to stay I’m begging this time
I know I was wrong but darlin’ I’ve paid
Please search your heart before it’s too late. 
   When you left me I said that I’d never be blue
   That I wouldn’t cry if you found someone new
   But this is my plea, give me one more try
   Please search your heart, don’t tell me goodbye. 
Please search your heart, don’t tell me goodbye
Please search your heart, don’t tell me goodbye

   Oh leave me or say that you want me
   And the stories that they told all lie down
   For somehow I can’t make my heart believe them
   They’re only poison lies going ’round
It tough now that you’re livin’ reckless
Goin’ places dear and doin’ things that’s wrong
Runnin’ ’round with the crowd you once hated
Just to spite one that’s loved you so long
Yeah at times we’ve tired of each other
Our love didn’t seem to be the same
Then you thought I had gone found another
So you left me and I took the blame

   For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
   And I know my life will never be the same
   For my pleading has all been in vain for you and you alone dear
   And you know that you are guilty of the same
Into each life a love is born for one and one alone dear
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know our love was never meant to be
But still my heart cries out for you and you alone my darling
It makes me never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain for you and you alone dear
And my better judgment tells me to say no

Police come I didn’t want to go this morning (2x)
Police come I didn’t want to go
Shot him in the head with my 44 this morning
Roll your dice and have your fun this morning (2X)
Roll your dice and have your fun
Run like the devil when the police come this morning
There’s old John laying on a log this morning (2x)
There’s old John laying on a log
Finger on the trigger and his eye on a hog, this morning
Down went the trigger and bang went the gun this morning (2x)
Down went the trigger and bang went the gun
Wish I had a wagon I’d be haulin him home this morning
Know a little secret I ain’t gonna tell is morning (2x)
Know a little secret I ain’t gonna tell
Wanna go to heaven but I’m goin down there this morning
There’s old John sittin on a plow this morning (2x)

Tryin’ to get a woman but don’t know how this morning
Tryin’ to get a woman but don’t know how this morning (2x)

Tryin’ to get a woman but I only got a sow this morning

Now come all ye hunters who follow the gun
Beware of your shooting at the setting of the sun
For Polly’s own true love he shot in the dark
But oh and alas Polly Vaughn was his mark.
   For she’d her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
   Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn
He ran up beside her and saw that it was she
Cried “Polly oh Polly have I killed thee”
He lifted up her head and saw that she was dead
And a fountain of tears for his true love he shed.
In the middle of the night Polly Vaughn did appear
Cried “Jimmy oh Jimmy you must have no fear;
Just tell them you were hunting when your trial day has come
And you won’t be convicted for what you have done.”
In the middle of the trial Polly Vaughn did appear
Crying “Uncle oh Uncle Jimmy Randall must go clear”
The lawyers and the judges stood around in a row
In the middle Polly Vaughn like some fountian of snow
 For she’d her apron wrapped about her and they took her for a swan
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn
Oh and alas it was she Polly Vaughn

My mother died when I was young
My sisters they were sad
They lay there hands upon my head
And ought me how to pray
   So now my mother she’s gone to rest
   In the land of purist joy
   And I wonder if she thinks of me
   Her poor little orphan boy
When I was only two years old
I never shall forget
A parting kiss she gave to me
I sometimes feel it yet
When I was sick and every hour
She watched me as I lay
And with her kind and gentle hand
She soothed me tenderly
So now I press this world alone
Her love with me shall stay
And from the throne above the skies
Her smiles shall rest on me

Just because he’s lazy sits around with the blues
They run Monroe off without his shoes
He always was lazy and he never liked to work
But now his feet they are bare as he runs through the dirt
If my family should ever do me that way
Id put my shoes on and go far away
But if they didn’t give me time they say I had to go
Then my feet would be bare I’d be just like Monroe
   Well i guess they told him
   They didn’t need him there
   And if he was out of the way
   They would draw welfare
   That’s whats messing up the country and making it so tough
   While monroe’s living it down
   His family’s living it up

Now the poor old dirt farmer he’s lost all his corn
And now where’s the money to pay off his loan
The loan that he signed to pay off his corn to pay off his loan
Now the poor old dirt farmer he lives all alone
His wife and kids left him and took all he owned
And on the next round they took all they found that wasn’t nailed down
Now the poor old dirt farmer how bad he does feel
He upset his tractor got caught in the wheel
And now his head is the shape of a tread and he still isn’t dead
Now the poor old dirt farmer it’s dry as a bone
ANd the biggest thing growin’ is a ten pound stone
And when its gets round he’ll roll it on down to the tax man in town
Now the poor old dirt farmer he’s lost all his corn
And now where’s the money to pay off his loan
The loan that he signed to pay off his corn to pay off his loan
to pay off his corn to pay off his loan…

I hear a low faint voice of death call full and mamma’s dead
And it comes from the poor orphan child that must be clothed and fed
And it calls from the poor orphan child that must be clothed and fed
And it calls from the poor orphan child that must be clothed and fed
Savior lead them by the hand (Gently lead them by the hand)
Savior lead them by the hand (Gently lead them by the hand)
Savior lead them by the hand
Till they all reach that glittering strand
They call from mended children mouths (?) poor little boys and girls
Who once had loved their loving hands to smooth their golden curls
Who wanted mothers loving hands to smooth their golden curls
Who wanted mothers loving hands to smooth their golden curls
But now we see those wandering curls hang gallop round their brow
They say to us my pappa’s dead and I’ve no mother now
They say to us my pappa’s dead and I’ve no mother now
They say to us my pappa’s dead and I’ve no mother now
Oh savior every orphan breath wherever they may roam
Bless every hand that leaves them aid and bless the orphan home
Bless every hand that leaves them aid and bless the orphan home
Bless every hand that leaves them aid and bless the orphan home

I’m a poor rebel soldier a long way from home
Ain’t had me no loving since the day I’ve been gone
Can’t find me no woman in this Yankee land
There’s a place in old Dixie I know where I can
Since I left old Georgia a long time ago
We run Grant’s big army in the land where it snows
The cold wind is blowing and freezing the rain
But there’s hot blood still running through these rebel veins
The call of the wild keeps howling to me
From the mountains down yonder in old Tennessee
Got a woman who’s waiting in old Knoxville town
When night falls I’m going to be Tennessee bound
I’m a poor rebel soldier and I’m going home
Cause I don’t call it living when I’m living alone
Come morning they’ll look but me they won’t find
I’m going to be south of that old Dixie line

While we are living in this world of care
Many the burdens that we have to bear
But there’s a prayer bell at the Lord’s right hand
Give it a ring and He will understand
   Prayer bells of heaven oh how sweetly they ring
   Bearing a message unto Jesus our king
   When you are burdened down with sorrows and care
   Ring on and on for God will answer your prayer
 Three Hebrew children to the fire were thrown
Because a worldly king they would not own
Jesus delivered and the king then saw
Prayer bells of heaven beat a man made law
 When Paul and Silas were thrown into jail
They didn’t worry who would go their bail
But on the prayer bells they began to ring
Off fell the stocks and they begin to sing
 Into the garden Jesus went to pray
Until His sweat became as blood they say
Ringing the prayer bells there in agony
Bringing salvation that we might be free

Way back in the hills when a boy I once wandered
Way deep in the grave lies the gal that I love
She was called from this earth a jewel for heaven
More precious than diamonds more precious than gold
   A jewel here on earth a jewel in heaven
   She’ll brighten the kingdom around God’s great throne
   May the angels have peace God bless her in heaven
   They’ve broken my heart and they’ve left me to roam
When a girl of sixteen we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her in heaven one night
   This world has left its wealth its trials and troubles
   The earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
   But they can’t hold the soul of one precious jewel
   She’s resting in peace in the heavenly fold

As I travel down life’s pathway
Knowing not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
   Precious Memories how they linger
   How they ever flood my soul
   In the stillness of the midnight
   Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes from my childhood
In fond memory appear

Pretending that I’m always happy
Pretending that I’m always gay when my heart
Inside of me is slowly dying
Every second every minute of the day
Pretending that I do not love you
Pretending I am glad you’re gone
When I know that you have gone away forever
And the pain within my heart goes on and on
Pretending that I’ll soon forget you
Pretending now is all I do
For I know that you have gone away forever
The game is over I know I’ve lost you

    My days are so lonely my nights are so blue
    Though my heart is broken it belongs to you
    Of misery and sorrow well I’ve had my share
    Like you I’m pretending that I don’t care
You pretend to be happy gay and care-free
But I know that sometimes you still think of me
Just being without you I can’t hardly bear
And like you I’m pretending that I don’t care
I prayed for the power to forget and forgive
That you ever hurt me the way that you did
Oh I shouldn’t want you but the feeling’s still there
And like you I’m pretending that I don’t care

I know there is a land of beautiful flowers
Where we’ll meet again when life is over
Where we’ll while away the endless hours
On heaven’s bright eternal shore
    The prettiest beds of flowers will be blooming
    By the prettiest treats our eyes will ever behold
    Where the beautiful tree of life for us is waiting
    By the prettiest mansion made with purest gold
I want to meet you by that beautiful river
On that eternal morning in the sky
Where we’ll live in peace through endless ages
Where we’ll never say goodbye
    The prettiest robes and crowns we’ll all be wearing
    In the city four square beyond this world of strife
    And the prettiest songs of the angels will be singing
    On the beautiful morning by the river of life
 

Pretty little miss out in the garden
Strange young man came riding by
Down at the gate he did address her
Saying pretty little miss won’t you marry me
Oh no my love is on the ocean
Seven years out on the sea
And if he sails seven years longer
No man on earth can marry me
Perhaps your loved one he is drowned
Perhaps he’s in some battle land
Perhaps he stole some girl and married
You’ll never see your love again
If he is drowned I hope he’s happy
Or if he’s in some battle land
Or if he stole some girl and married
I’ll love the girl that married him
He pulled his hand out of his pockets
His fingers being keen and small
This is the ring you placed upon here
Down by his feet she did fall
He picked her up in arms so tender
Kisses he gave her one two three
This is your little single soldier
Returning home to marry thee

Oh Polly, Pretty Polly, would you take me unkind
Polly, Pretty Polly, would you take me unkind
Let me set beside you and tell you my mind
Well my mind is to marry and never to part
My mind is to marry and never to part
The first time I saw you it wounded my heart
Oh Polly Pretty Polly come go along with me
Polly Pretty Polly come go along with me
Before we get married some pleasures to see
Oh he led her over mountains and valleys so deep
He led her over hills and valleys so deep
Pretty Polly mistrusted and then began to weep
Oh Willie, Little Willie, I’m afraid to of your ways
Willie, Little Willie, I’m afraid of your ways
The way you’ve been rambling you’ll lead me astray
Oh Polly, Pretty Polly, your guess is about right
Polly, Pretty Polly, your guess is about right
I dug on your grave the biggest part of last night
Oh she knelt down before him a pleading for her life
She knelt down before him a pleading for her life
Let me be a single girl if I can’t be your wife
Oh Polly, Pretty Polly that never can be
Polly, Pretty Polly that never can be
Your past recitation’s been trouble to me
Oh went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
He went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
I’ve killed Pretty Polly and trying to get away

When I first came to this country in 1849
I saw many fair lovers but I did not see mine
I viewed the world ’round me saw I was quite alone
And me a poor stranger and a long way from home
Oh my true love she don’t want me and it’s this I understand
She wants a freeholder and I have no land
But I could maintain her on silver and gold
And all of the other things that my love’s house could hold
Oh I wish I was a little dove, had wings and could fly
Straight to my love’s bosom this night I’d draw nigh
And in her little small arms all night I would lay
And think of pretty Saro till the dawning of day
It’s fair thee well to old mother and fare thee well to father too
I’m going for to ramble this wide world all through
And when I get weary I’ll sit down and cry
And think of my Saro pretty Saro my bride

Last night as I lay sleeping I dreamed a dream so fair
I dreamed about my darling the rose was in her hair
I dreamed I left this prison started in life a new
She told me that she loved me told me her love was dear
It was only a dream just a prisoner’s dream
As I lay on my cold prison bed
My dreams of you can never come true dear girl
I wish that I were dead
I dreamed she called me darling kissed me and held me tight
I dreamed that we were married dreamed of a starry night
I dreamed about our children playing around my knee
They loved me called me daddy they thought the world of me
I dreamed a dream so lovely heaven on earth it seemed
My wife and little children came to me in that dream
They threw their arms around me I was their pride and joy
My little wife she loved me I was her darling boy

Sweetheart a prisoner’s last letter
I had to send to you today
But when you read these words of sorrow
My soul will then have passed away
For at the dawn of day tomorrow
I then will pay for my mistake
God gave me courage for this message
I’ve realized my sin too late
   A letter dear and from a prisoner
   Don’t shed a tear when I am gone
   I’ve troubled you too much already
   I hate to leave you all alone
As if in dreams I see you smiling
Your pretty eyes are like a song
You warned my darling now I’m pining
You knew that I was doing wrong
Outside the shadows now are fading
They circle me complete my life
I’ll soon be gone and when I’m dying
I’ll think of you and pay the price
I hear the guard outside my window
And on his rounds he seems so slow
It seems he’s trying me to comfort
It seems he hates to see me go
Please take this message to my mother
And give her all my love and cheer
This final message now I’m writing
To one I’ll always love so dear

Oh I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
I wish I had someone to live with
I’m tired of living alone.
   So meet me tonite love oh meet me
   Meet me out in the moonlight alone
   For I have a sad story to tell you
   Must be told in the moonlight alone.
I have a great ship on the ocean
All mounted in silver and gold
And before my little darling would suffer
That ship would be anchored and sold
I’ll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor sweetheart alone
With these cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone
If I had the wings of an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
I would fly to the arms of my darlin
And there I’d be willing to die

Oh I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me her own
Oh I wish I had someone to live with
For I’m tired of living alone
   Oh please meet me tonight in the moonlight
   Please meet me tonight all alone
   For I have a sad story to tell you
   It’s a story that’s never been told
 I’ll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor darling alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone
 Now I have a grand ship on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
Oh that ship would be anchored and sold
 Now if I had wings like an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I’d fly to the arms of my poor darling
And there I’d be willing to die

With every golden curl in place she’s as fine as Queen Anne’s lace
And know one could ever fault the way she looks tonight
The man standing by her side shows her off with such eager pride
Seems since I saw her last she’s done all right
She could never place me in her mind for me the years have not been kind
She’d never see the boy she knew in the man I’ve grown to be
From her station and her place she’d never recognize my face
I have fallen like a wind blown leaf from her memory
   For she’s traded all her pain for bright lights and chilled champayne
   And I’m sure her new found friends all think they know just where she’s been
   Yes they think they know here well all the stories I could tell
   She’s as fine as Queen Anne’s lace but I knew her when
Now it’s hard to believe I know but she once loved me long ago
And I ‘spose I should be hurtin’ just to see her once again
Oh but now she’s grown so proud I wouldn’t want her anyhow
She’s as fine as Queen Anne’s lace but I knew her when
Del McCoury; Blue Side OF Town

Let me tell you why I feel so sadIt’s all because of the wife I’ve hadAn untimely death has come to meLeft me too lame to walk too blind to see
In a quiet grave on a green hillsideMy love is gone my love has diedMy wedding band I’ll put with youOh how I wish I were with you too
What’s a man to do with a broken heartNowhere to go no place to startI search and search but all I findIs a tormented soul and a worried mind

Well I got me a hat and old guitar
And I made a down payment on a second hand car
I got me a job on the radio
Now I’m saving up money for a fiddle and a bow 
   Do the radio boogie
   All over the dial
   With a solid kick and a red hot lick
   And some Tennessee style
Well early in the mountain when the sun comes up
I pull the cork from the jug and I take a little sup
If the sun keeps a-shining I’ll plow the corn
If it stars to rain I’ll just grind it in the barn
Well I call my gal on the telephone
What you doing honey are you all alone
Come on over about an hour or so
And we’ll both do the boogie by the radio
Yes I got a job in a hillbilly band
I got brand new clothes I got money to spend
And everbody asks me where we play
The radio boogie’s all they can say

Nineteen and sixteen I started to roam
Out in the West no money no home
I went drifting along with the tide
I landed on the Great Divide
Railroading on the Great Divide,
Nothing around me but Rockies and sky
There you’ll find me as years go by
Railroading on the Great Divide
Ask any old-timer from Old Cheyenne,
Railroad in Wyoming the best in the land
The long steel rails, the short cross ties
I laid across the Great Divide.
As I looked out across the breeze
Number Three coming, the fastest on wheels
Through old Laramie (Lamar) she glides with pride
And rolls across the Great Divide

I was born one rainy morn
Just before my mama died
Five years daddy left me
The rain was falling down outside
   Rain oh rain leave me alone
   You’re icy fingers chill my bones
   Seems trouble always comes around
   Each time the rain starts falling down
It seems the years pass by so quickly
I grew up fast I grew apart
Next thing I knew the rain was falling
Out across the prison yard
Now when I die make me this promise
To bury me in the darkest cave
So I may know while I am resting
No rain will fall upon my grave

Well I married me a wife, she gave me trouble all my life
Left me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow…………
She left me out in the cold rain and snow
She came down the stairs holding back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose………………..
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
Well I’ve done all that I can do to try to get along with you
And I ain’t gonna be treated this old way
This old way……………
Now I ain’t gonna be treated this old way
We’ll she came in to the room where she met her final doom
And I ain’t gonna be treated this old way
This old way………………
Now I ain’t gonna be treated this old way
She left me out in the cold rain and snow

   Rain rain rain
   I can feel the clouds of heartache moving in
   Rain rain rain
   You’ve got leaving on your mind again.
Your love for me is like the changing weather
With just enough sun to keep me hanging on
And foolish me keeps hoping it’ll get better
But clouds roll in and once more you are gone.
Rainbows that appear are just illusions
That man has looked for since the days of old
And like the rainbow your love’s always moving
But I keep looking for that pot of gold.

When I first heard the sound of the river going down
knew I had to travel like the waters from my home
To see what I could see go beyond my boundaries
And look into the heart of the life I chose for me.
   On and on oh why must I ramble
   Following dreams out before me in the night
   On and on the highway’s a gamble
   Better think of home again before it’s out of sight.
When I left to see the world my one and only girl
Decided that this passion is a fearful thing to fight
I tried to prove her wrong I said I won’t be long
Please take the love I give you but I knew that she was right.
She never asks the wherefores but sometimes just the whys
That her love alone can hold me from the current deep inside
I hope and pray that she’ll be there each time that I come home
The strength her love still gives me is the thing that lets me roam.

   Made up my mind my darlin
   Made up my mind today
   I’m feeling this way and there’s no use to stay
   Honey I’m ramblin away
Made up my mind and I’m leavin
Goin away to stay
I’ve decided it’s best and you know all the rest
Honey I’m ramblin away
Once I believed sincerely
That you’d be mine someday
But I do all I do for me and for you
Honey I’m ramblin away
All I had hoped for honey
Was just to hear you say
That to me you’d be true but now I’m so blue
Honey I’m ramblin away

He was a pal and a friend always
We rambled round in the hard ol’ days
He never cared if I had no dough
We rambled round in the rain and snow
   So here’s to you my ramblin’ boy
   May all your rambles bring you joy
   So here’s to you my ramblin’ boy
   May all your rambles bring you joy
In Tulsa town we chanced to stray
We thought we’d try to work one day
The boss says he had room for one
Says my old pal We’d rather bum
Late one night in a jungle camp
The weather was cold and it was damp
He got the chills and he got them bad
They took the only friend I ever had
He left me here to ramble on
My ramblin’ pal is dead and gone
If when we die we go somewhere
I’ll bet you a dollar he’s ramblin’ there

I can settle down and be doin’ just fine
Til I  hear an old freight rollin’ down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn’t go I believe I’d blow my stack
I love you baby but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me He made a ramblin’ man
Some folks might say that I’m no good
That I wouldn’t settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin’ me
There’s somethin’ o’er the hill that I gotta see
Sometimes it’s hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me He made a ramblin’ man
I love to see the towns a-passin’ by
And to ride these rails ‘neath God’s blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
‘Cause that’s the life I believe He meant for me
And when I’m gone and at my grave you stand
Just say God called home your ramblin’ man
 

He was a friend and a pal always
He stuck with me in the hard old days
He never cared if I had no dough
We rambled round though the rain and snow
In Tulsa town we chanced to stray
We thought we’d try for work one day
The boss said he had room for one
Said my old pal we’d rather bum
Here’s to you my ramblin’ by
May all your ramblin’ bring you joy
Here’s to you my ramblin’ by
May all your ramblin’ bring you joy
Late one in a jungle camp
The weather it was cold and damp
He got a chills and he got ’em bad
They took the only pal I had
He’s left me here to ramble on
My rambling pal he’s dead and gone
If when we die we go somewhere
I’ll be you a dollar he’s ramblin’ there

I was raised but a rambling boy
Too many a city I did enjoy
And there I married me a pretty little wife
And I loved her dearer than I love my life
She was pretty both neat and gay
She caused me rob the road highway
I robbed it yes I do declare
I made myself ten thousand there
Plenty dry goods for to carry me through
My pistol swore like money too
My forty four she never failed
My true love come for to go my bale
My mother said she has no home
My sister said she’s all alone
My wife she’s left with sad despair
With a broken heart and a baby there
Now when I die don’t bury me at all
Just place me away in alcohol
My forty four lay by my feet
Please tell them I am just asleep

   I don’t want your rambling letters
   Don’t want your picture in a frame
   All I want is you in person
   Won’t you let me change your name
Mama said you’d come home soon
Papa warned me not to wait
Sister thinks that you still love me
Hurry home right away
I’m so tired of long distance kisses
Love by mail is all so cold
I just want you in my arms dear
Then our love just can’t grow old

There’s a ramshackle shack down in old Caroline
And it’s callin’ me back to that sweetheart of mine
Those pretty blue eyes I long to see
Down in old Caroline there I long to be
Those pretty blue eyes that sparkle with love
Sent down to me from Heaven above
And if I had wings like a beautiful dove
I’d fly away to the girl I love
When the whippoorwills call at the close of day
We would sing love songs and she would say
My love for you will never die
Then we bid farewell such a sad good-bye
When it’s harvest time down in old Caroline
I’ll be driftin’ back to that sweetheart of mine
Spend the rest of my days with the girl that I love
With the help of the Lord up in Heaven above

I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youths early dawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me
   Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
   No mother no dad not a friend I could see
   They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
   I found they were all rank strangers to me
They’ve moved all away said the voice of a stranger
To a beautiful home by the bright crystal sea
Some beautiful day I’ll meet them in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me

In a dreary Yankee prison
Where a Rebel soldier lay
By his side there stood a preacher
Ere his soul should pass away
And he faintly whispered Parson
As he clutched him by the hand
Oh parson tell me quickly
Will my soul pass through the southland
Will my soul pass through the southland
To my old Virginia Grand
Will I see the hills of Georgia
And the green fields of Alabam’
Will I see that little church house
Where I placed my heart in hand
Oh parson tell me quickly
Will my soul pass through the southland
Was for lovin’ dear ol’ Dixie
In this dreary cell I lie
Was for lovin’ dear ol’ Dixie
In this northern state I’ll die
Will you see my little daughter
Will you make her understand
Oh parson tell me quickly
Will my soul pass through the southland

Yonder stands the reckless motorman
Who says his age is twenty one
Standing by his mainline motor
Saying folks what have I done
Is it true I’ve killed my brakemen
Is it true that he is dying
Oh I tried to stop my motor
But I could not stop in time
See the cars stacked up on him
See him raise his weary head
See his sister standing by him
Crying brother are you dead
Sister sister I am dying
Soon I’ll be on yonder shore
Soon I’ll have a home in heaven
There’ll be no braking anymore
Go and tell my youngest brother
Take these words true and end ?
To never start the day a braking
For his life is sure to end
Go tell my father who is weighman
What he weighs to weigh it fair
There’ll be no scales up in heaven
For that meeting in the air

The girls all dance with the boys from the city
But they don’t care to dance with me
Well it ain’t my fault that the fields are muddy
And the red clay stains my feet
Well its under my nails and its under my collar
And it shows on my Sunday clothes
Though I do my best with soap and water
That damned old dirt won’t go
   But when I pass through the pearly gates
   Will my gown be gold instead
   Or just a red clay robe with red clay wings
   And a red clay halo for my head
It’s mud in the spring and it’s dust in the summer
When it rolls in crimson tide
‘Til the trees and leaves and the cows are the color
Of the dirt on the mountainside
Now Jordan’s banks are red and muddy
And the rolling water is wide
But I got no boat, so I’ll be good and muddy
When I get to the other side
   I’ll take the red clay robe and the red clay wings
   And the red clay halo for my head

Ain’t got no use
For your red rocking chair
I ain’t got no sugar baby now
I ain’t got no honey baby now
Who’ll rock the cradle
Who’ll sing this song
Who’ll rock cradle when I’m gone
Who’ll rock cradle when I’m gone
It’s I’ll rock the cradle
I’ll sing this song
It’s I’ll rock the cradle when you’re gone
It’s I’ll rock the cradle when you’re gone
It’s all I can do
It’s all I can say
Gonna send you to your momma next payday
Gonna send you to your momma next payday
It’s all I can do
It’s all I can say
I can’t get along this a way
I can’t get along this a way

I should have known you’ve bid me farewell
There’s lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Always running never caring
That’s the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
   And I guess it’s gonna be all right
   Yes the worst is over now
   The morning sun is shining
   Like a red rubber ball
   I guess it’s gonna be all right
   Yes the worst is over now
   The morning sun is shining
   Like a red rubber ball
Now you never cared for the secrets I could find
To you I’m just an ornament
Something for your mind
This roller coaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That’s all I’m gonna spend
* Refrain

Red sails in the sunset way out on the sea
Oh carry my loved one home safely to me
He sailed at the dawning all day I’ve been blue
Red sails in the sunset I’m trusting in you
Swift wings you must borrow make straight for the shore
We marry tomorrow and he goes sailing no more
Red sails in the sunset way out on the sea
Oh carry my loved one home safely to me

   Wherever I go in this world little darlin
   You’ll be in my mind only you
   I’ll never forget you as long as I’m livin
   Remember I feel lonesome too
   I know I’m to blame for the way that we’re parting
   But honey I love only you
   So give me a chance just to prove I’ll do better
   Remember I feel lonesome too
I hope you will read the remarks in this letter
Please take time to read what I say
I’ve tried and I’ve tried just to see you my darlin
I can’t so I’m goin away

The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days were the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said Sweetheart remember me
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I’m dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours ’til the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and we will never
Be the same except in memory
A brighter face may take my place when we’re apart dear
A sweeter smile and a love more bold and free
But in the end fair weather friends may break your heart dear
If they do sweetheart remember me

Do you think of the cross on which Jesus died
Of the blood he shed for you
Are you prepared to meet him in that land of love
By his word are you going to abide
   Remember the cross on which Jesus died
   Follow in his footsteps each day
   He shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
   Never cast that cross aside
Never let other people lead you astray
Teach his words to them if you can
They must think of that cross on which Jesus died
And get ready to meet him someday
When Jesus comes down from heaven above
And you haven’t thought of that cross
He’ll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
And you won’t see his blessed home of love

So often down here we’ll have a reunion
Our loved ones and friends will be gathered around
Some faces are missed. They have gone home to heaven
They will be there with Jesus ’til the trumpet shall sound
What a wonderful time we’ll have up in Glory
With our blessed Redeemer forever we’ll see
And a crown he will give on that great judgment morning
What a happy reunion in Heaven will be
No crepes on the doors in that beautiful city
No sorrow or pain never more ever there
But a body we’ll have in the Saviour’s own likeness
And a mansion Jesus said he’d go to prepare
I am longing to sit by the banks of the river
There’s rest for the ones by the evergreen trees
I am longing to look in the face of my Saviour
And my loved ones who have gone they are waiting for me

No matter what I say or do
You’re never satisfied
I’ve tried I’ve tried so many times
So I’m leaving you now goodbye
   I’m riding on that midnight train
   My head is hanging low
   Them awful blues will follow me
   Wherever I may go
Why on earth was I ever born
I’ll never understand
To fall in love with a woman like you
In love with another man

Raleigh and Spencer are burning down
No there ain’t no liquor in town
No there ain’t no liquor in town
Whatcha gonna do to wet them lips
When the whole darn town runs dry
When the whole darn town runs dry
I been all around this whole wide world
I been down to Memphis Tennessee
Yes I been down to Memphis Tennessee
I played cards with the kings and queens
I shot dice with old Jesse James
I shot dice with old Jesse James
I can eat more chicken than any one gal can fry
I can tell more low-down lies
I can tell more low-down lies
I can tell more lies than there’re stars in the sky
And I ain’t going to heaven when I die
No I ain’t going to heaven when I die
I’d trade my shoes for one bottle of booze
I’d drink it I’d lay down and die
Yes I’d drink it I’d lay down and die
You can stomp down all the flowers that’ll grow round my grave
But they’ll rise and bloom again
Yes they’ll rise and bloom again

Oh the river of death lies just before me
Can I find a place that I can cross
Or will I be in sin forever
Oh Lord don’t let my soul be lost
   Oh I wanna walk with Christ my savior
   For he’s the one that’ll guide me on
   All through my life I’ve been a sinner
   Now I’m right with God so I’m travelling home
Oh I can hear my savior calling
To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering
Oh, praise the Lord I’m ready to go
My life down here will soon be over
And this old world holds nothing for me
He saved my soul and He made me happy
That beautiful land I’m going to see

To the River Of Jordan our Savior went one day
And we read that John The Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan’s rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air
I’m on my way to the River Of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I’m going down to the River Of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul
King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman “go dip yourself in Jordan”
And let the cool waters wash your spots away
So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself in the River Of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole
Oh the River Of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I’ll find myself an altar in an old fashioned church
And my River Of Jordan that will be

In the beautiful hills in the mists of Roane County
There’s where I have roamed for many long years
There’s where my heart’s been tendin most ever
There’s where the first step of misfortune I made
It’s about thirty years when I courted and married
Armanda Gilbraith I’d soon call my wife
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month’s later I’d taken Tom’s life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next mornin’
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor Mother stood weepin’
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was “Willy God bless you”
Was “Willy God bless you God bless you goodbye”
In the scorching hot sand of the foundry I’m workin’
Toiling and working my poor life away
They’ll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days
Poort Martha was grave, but Corey was better
There’s better and worse, although you may see
Boys when you write home from this prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for me

I’ve got a wife and five little children
Believe I’ll make a trip on the big Macmillan
Oh Saro Jane
   Oh there’s nothing to do but to set down and sing
   And rock about my Saro Jane
   Oh rock about my Saro Jane
   Oh rock about my Saro Jane
   Oh there’s nothing to do but to set down and sing
   And rock about my Saro Jane
Boiler busted and the whistle done blowed
The head captain done fell overboard
Oh Saro Jane
Engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall
The engineer gone ti the hole in the wall
Oh Saro Jane
Yankees built boats for to shoot them rebels
My musket’s loaded and I’m gonna hold her level
Oh Saro Jane

Why did you break my heart and throw it down
Why did you spread the news all over town
Why did you make me your laughing stock
Because you’ve got a heart of rock
   Rock hearts will break believe it my dear
   And yours will break in two I fear
   And when it does dear don’t run to me
   For it will be too late you see
You didn’t break my heart by running round
Another new love you have not found
You only handed me back a lock
You had around your heart of rock

On the banks of the river where the willows hang down
And the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
Down in the hollow where the waters run cold
It was there I first listened to the lies that you told
Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
The past I remember time cannot erase
The letter you wrote me it was written in shame
And I know that your conscience still echo’s my name
Now the nights are so long, Lord sorrow runs deep
And nothing is worse than a night without sleep
I’ll walk out alone and look at the sky
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry
If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes
I’d lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrel’s with high bushy tails
I’d fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails

Apples in the summer time
Peaches in the fall
If I don’t get the girl I love
Won’t have none at all
Going to Rocky Island
Going when I’m gone
See my Candy darling
Ho honey ho
Get up on the mountain
Sow a little cane
Make a barrel of sorghum
Sweetin’ ole Liza Jane
Black clouds a risin’
Sure sign of rain
Get your old gray bonnet
See little Liza Jane

   Now the road is rocky, but it won’t be rocky long
   Now the road is rocky, but it won’t be rocky long
   Another man has got my woman and gone
I’ve got those blues, I’m wearing out the soles of my shoes
I’ve got those blues, I’m wearing out the soles of my shoes
My gal went away and left me she left me with the dog gone blues
You’ll never miss your water til the well runs dry
You’ll never miss your water til the well runs dry
You’ll never miss your woman until she says goodbye
I wish to the Lord you’d bring my woman back home
I wish to the Lord you’d bring my woman back home
I’m not so lonesome, just don’t want to be alone

I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain’t no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain’t no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that
   Rocky Top you’ll always be
   Home sweet home to me
   Good old Rocky Top
   Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Looking for a moonshine still
Strangers ain’t come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
Corn won’t grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt’s too rocky by far
That’s why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
I’ve had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it’s a pity life
Can’t be simple again

   Roll in my sweet baby’s arms
   Roll in my sweet baby’s arms
   Lay around the shack ’til the mail comes back
   And I’ll roll in my sweet baby’s arms
I ain’t gonna work on the railroad
I ain’t gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack ’til the mail train comes back
And I’ll roll in my sweet baby’s arms
Now where were you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn’t even go my bail
I know you parents don’t like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I’d never go there any more

   Roll on, buddy, roll on
   Roll on, buddy, roll on
   Wouldn’t roll so slow
   If you knew what I know
   So roll on, buddy, roll on
I’m going to that east pay road
I’m going to that east pay road
I’m going to that east, I’m going to the west
I’m going to the one that I love best
My home in down in Tennessee
My home in down in Tennessee
In sunny Tennessee, that’s where I want to be
Way down in sunny Tennessee
I’ve got a good woman just the same
I’ve got a good woman just the same
Got a woman just the same, and I’m gonna change her name
I’ve got a good woman just the same

Beyond the sea where faiths of glorious beam
Where things abide that I have never seen
The soul’s sweet home desperate never more
Will there be room for me on that bright shore
   There’s room (room for you and me) yes room (room for you and me)
   There’s room (room for me) for all (room enough for all)
   There’s room (yes there’s room for me) for all (room enough for all)
   There’s room (room enough in heaven) for me
That wondrous city far beyond confine
Where all is joy and peace so pure divine
In visions I in varying streaks can see
And wonder if there’s room in heaven for me
I long to soar away and be at rest
And there to lean upon my savior’s breast
Oh wont that be a glorious victory
To find that there is room in heaven for me

We pass in the hallway almost everyday
Though I’ve never really met him we don’t have too much to say
Though I feel that I know him for every night about this time
When he’s a walkin and a talkin in the room over mine
   He may be thinking of things that might have been
   Or of his family and how he’s missing them
   Oh it’s hard to know what’s going on in a troubled man’s mind
   But I can hear him walking and talking in the room over mine
Well its plain to see he’s had a troubled mind
By the lines across his face
And the sadness that dims his eyes search for a better place
Well I know just how he really feels every night about this time
When he’s a walking and a talking I’ll be in that room of mine

Away from Mississippi’s vale
With my ol’ hat there for a sail
I crossed upon a cotton bale
To Rose of Alabama
I landed on the far sand bank
I sat upon the hollow plank
And there I made the banjo twank
For Rose of Alabama
    Oh brown Rosie
    Rose of Alabama
    Sweet tobacco posey
    Is my Rose of Alabama
    Sweet tobacco posey
    Is my Rose of Alabama
I says to her sit as you please
Across my leg she took her ease
It’s good to go upon the knees
Said Rose of Alabama
The river rose the cricket sang
The lightnin’ bug did flash his wing
Then like a rope my arms I fling
Round Rose of Alabama
We hugged so long I cannot tell
My Rosie seemed to like it well
My banjo in the river fell
Oh Rose of Alabama
Like alligator after prey
I dives in but it float away
And all the while it seem to say
Oh Rose of Alabama
Now every day come rain or shower
I hunt my banjo for an hour
And meet my sweet tobacco flower
Oh Rose of Alabama
Oh fare thee well you belles of Spain
And fare thee well to Liza Jane
Your charms will all be put to shame
By Rose of Alabama

We’re the best partners this world’s ever seen
Together as close as can be
But sometimes it’s hard to find time in between
To tell you what you are to me 
   You are the rose of my heart
   You are the love of my life
   A flower not faded nor falling apart
   If you’re tired, rest your head on my arm
    Rose of my Heart. 
 When sorrow holds you in her arms of clay
It’s raindrops that fall from your eyes
Your smile is the dun come to earth for a day
You brighten my blackest of skies 
   You are the rose of my heart
   You are the love of my life
   A flower not faded nor falling apart
   If you’re cool let my love make you warm
    Rose of my heart 
 So hard times are easy times, what do I care
There’s nothing I’d change if I could
The tears and the laughter are things that we share
Your hand in mine makes all times good 
 CH 3 You are the rose…
You are the love…
A flower…
You’re my harbour in life’s restless storm
Rose of my heart.

She bloomed for me in a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows to love each other
And I know we always will.
   She’s my rose of old Kentucky
    I watch her bloom as the years roll by
   For me there’ll never be another
    I’ll love her ’til the day I die.
In my dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
How I long for old Kentucky
For my darling I will meet.
Well I know you often wonder
And I’ll tell you the reason why
She’s my rose of old Kentucky
And I know that she will never lie.

We knew no sorrow and we knew no grief
Until their loving face was missed
There are the engravings upon his tombstone
Each time that we read them we realize he’s gone
Just like a rose he was picked from our view
He was needed in heaven with God’s chosen few
My mother was called just a few weeks before
Two angels have bloomed like a rose on God’s shore
I guess Jesus thought him unsafe here below
So he called him home while he’s ready to go
That beautiful smile on his face that I kissed
I’ve never known sorrow till that face I missed

I met my darling in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers our love blossomed
We married in the month of June
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow (3rd time “cold winds blow”)
We had sunshine in December
And grew our roses in the snow
Now God has taken my darlin’
And left me with a memory
A memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me
My darlin’s buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when the winter snow starts falling
On his grave I’ll place a rose.

I know your friends don’t approve of me
And I can understand why
I’ll never fit into your way of life
There’s no need for me to even try
   I got rough edges all over me
   I can’t change, not even for you
   You can chisel and mold but I’m brittle as coal
   Those edges will never be smooth
I don’t regret that we fell in love
I’m proud I once called you mine
But sweetheart we must say goodbye
We’ve come to the end of the line

The fog is rolling out from Memphis
Dark clouds are hangin’ round your door
It’s a long long way from Mississippi
To the Gulf of Mexico
    Well, I make my home on the Mississippi
    I’m a roustabout on a Steamboat line
    We hit the deck on a Monday morning
    Gonna make the dock on a Saturday night
Had me a gal way up in Vicksburg
I tipped my hat every time she passed
Then she ran off with a riverboat gambler
With a black silk suit and a little mustache
Now when I die there’s just one favor
Don’t bury me down in the cold cold ground
Just wrap me up down by the river
Roll me over and point me south

I went up on a mountain
Gave my horn a blow
Thought I hear my true love say
Yonder comes by beau
   Rove Riley Rove
   Rove Riley Rove
   Rove Riley poor boy
   Ain’t got nowhere to go
Mama give me meat
Mother give me bread
Pretty girl give me one sweet kiss
Like to done killed me dead
  
Went up on a mountain
Done stripped me a load of cane
Make me a barrel of molasses
Sweet Miss Liza Jane
 
Daddy had a great big house
A hundred stories high
Every story in that house
Was filled with chicken pie

I am a roving gambler gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down
I had not been in Frisco many more weeks than three
I met up with a pretty little gal
She fell in love with me
Fell in love with me, fell in love with me
She took me in her parlor, cooled me with her fan
Whispered low in her mother’s ear
I love this gambling man
Love this gambling man, love this gambling man
Oh daughter oh dear daughter how can you treat me so
Leave your dear old mother
And with a gambler go
With a gambler go, with a gambler go
My mother oh my mother you can not understand
If you ever see me a coming back
I’ll be with a gambling man
With a gambling man, with a gambling man
I left her there in Frisco and I wound up in Maine
I met up with a gambling man
Got in a poker game
Got in a poker game, got in a poker game
We put our money in the pot and dealt the cards around
I saw him deal from the bottom of the deck
And I shot that gambler down
Shot the gambler down, shot the gambler down
Well, now I’m in the jailhouse got a number for my name
The Warden said as he locked the door
You’ve gambled your last game
Gambled your last game, gambled your last game

Dust in the meadow, smoke on the mountainside
Theres an air of desparation comin cross the great divide
Thunder rollin, shakin the valley down
But it ain’t the second comin thats drummin up that soud
     
    Its the train of broken dreams run on misery and woe
    Come to take the down-trodden when there’s noplace else to go
    And there’ll be no mistakin when you hear that whistle whine
    You’re standin at the station of the ruination line
Tell you brother I can’t get no sleep
There’s heretics in the capitol and heroes on the street
In this corp’rate prison what for is my bail
Its 80 bucks a barrell son your freedom is for sale
   
    Well they give me excuses, they give me their word
    But its hard to give a damn when your unemployed, uninsured
    Can’t afford to pay no doctor, no ambulance ride
    They just left me with my chances on the ruination line
Drive your mule boy, up that field and back
You gotta earn your keep here make no doubt about that fact
No time for stallin, no time for to wait
No time for your lost soul just tryin to find its place
     
    All I ever wanted was a little peace and quiet
    A stash of my own,and a girl to hold tight
    But now I’m broke,dry and dirty and my good love passed me by
    Feel I’m primed and ready for that ruination line
So lay my head down on that rail
And maybe she can ease my mind
And I pray she moves me swiftly down that ruination line
 

   Today has been a lonesome day
   Today has been a lonesome day
   Today has been a lonesome day
   And tomorrow ‘s gonna be the same old way 
Oh, they carried my mother to the burying ground
Oh, they carried my mother to the burying ground
Oh, they carried my mother to the burying ground
I watched as the bearers let her down 
Did you ever hear a church bell tone
Did you ever hear a church bell tone
Did you ever hear a church bell tone
You may know by that she’s dead and gone 
Oh, dig my grave with a silver spade
Oh, dig my grave with a silver spade
Oh, dig my grave with a silver spade
And mark the place where I must lay 
There’s one kind favor I ask of you
There’s one kind favor I ask of you
There’s one kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept green

I’m a prisoner alone and forgotten
I’ll be here until the day I die
All because when a boy I was foolish
All because I was fast with a knife
I’m a man that’s doomed to be lonely
I’m a man that’s doomed to be sad
I’ve got no name just a number
And I’ve lost all the friends that I’ve had
If I had my life to live over
I’d travel the narrow and straight
But I’d still be at home with my loved ones
And not behind these iron gates
Young men when you have heard my story
Let it teach you the right from the wrong
And I know my life wasn’t wasted
Writing this sad prisoner’s song

When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave as bad as you want them to stay
    And theres nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
    When one don’t care at all and the other cares too much
    Its a sad situation I must say
    When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you but I know you dont love me
And I know its just a matter of time before you leave
But why do I stand aside and just let you walk away
When I know you want to leave as bad as I want you to stay
    What do you do, what do you say
    When you know they want to leave as bad as you want them to stay

A Sailor’s life is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart’s delight
Leaving them alone to weep and mourn
They never know when he’ll return
Of four and twenty all in a row
My true love makes the finest show
He’s proper tall, genteel with all
If I can’t have him I’ll have none at all
My father built me a bonny boat
That on the ocean I might float
And every queen ship that we passed by
I’d there inquire for my sailor boy
She had not sailed long upon the deep
When a queen ship she chanced to meet
You sailors all please tell me true
Does my sweet William sail among your crew?
Oh no fair maiden he’s not here
For he’s been drowned we greatly fear
On yon green island as we passed by
There we lost sight upon your sailor boy
She wrung her hands, she tore her hair
She was a maid in great despair
Her little boat on the rock she did run
Saying how shall I live now that my William is gone?
A sailor’s life is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart’s delight
Leaving them behind to weep and mourn
They never know when he’ll return

He promised to write me a letter,
He promised to write to me;
But I haven’t heard from my darling,
Who is sailing on the deep blue sea
“Oh, captain, can you tell me,
Can you tell me where he may be?”
“Oh yes, my pretty maiden,
He is drownded in the deep blue sea”
Farewell to friends and relations
This is the last you’ll see of me,
For I’m going to end my troubles
By drowning in the deep blue sea

Dear sweetheart as I write to you my heart is filled with pain
For if those things I hear are true I’ll never see you again
They tell me darlin’ that tonight you’ll wed another man
But if you do I’ll tell you true my boat will never land 
You promised that you would wait for me that nothin’ could come between
That in my arms someday you’d be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair
My future hopes are placed in you you’ve been my guidin’ star
Please write and tell me that you’re true to the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
I’ll return and then we’ll wed and live a happy life

In a pine treated grave by the river
Where the nightingale sings sad and low
All alone lies a Saint Regis maiden
Who did sing this sad song years ago
Never more will my heart fill with gladness
As I stroll through the forest again
For to prison they’ve taken my lover
That’s why my poor heart’s full of pain
When in prison your dying from sorrow
I hope you’ll recall those last days
That together we spent in this valley
And the vows that we’ve shared on its quay
Oh if I could but burn down that prison
To steal you away for awhile
They could carry me off to the gallows
And I’d go to my doom with a smile
When the moon is high in the heavens
And the mountains do gleam in its light
How often I’ll dream of you sweetheart
As I mourn there alone in the night
There will be a green grave in the forest
And people when passing that way
Will think of that Saint Regis maiden
As she lies there alone in the clay
A shadow has crossed o’er the valley
Where once only sunshine did reign
But where ever life’s pathway may lead me
I shall ever remember our dream
In the future someday I will meet you
On the bright shore so far from this world
And there before God I will greet you
That’s the dream of the Saint Regis girl

Sal’s got a meatskin hid away
Sal’s got a meatskin hid away
Sal’s got a meatskin hid away
Gonna get a meatskin some day
Sal’s got a meatskin don’t you know
Sal’s got a meatskin don’t you know
Sal’s got a meatskin don’t you know
Old Liza told me so
Sal’s a-sailling on the sea
Sal’s a-sailling on the sea
Sal’s a-sailling on the sea
Sal’s got a meatskin a-waiting for me
Went to see my Sally Gray
Went to see my Sally Gray
Went to see my Sally Gray
Found out Sal is gone away
Love my Sally more and more
Love my Sally more and more
Love my Sally more and more
Sal’s got a meatskin don’t you know
Reckon I love my Sally Gray
Reckon I love my Sally Gray
Reckon I love my Sally Gray
Reckon my Sal is gone away

I got me in bed and covered my head
Wish I was dead with Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Since you have gone my days are turned to night
Nothin’ goes right Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
The hurt you left has just begun to show
Sally Jo I’ve been so low
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
I’m like a little dog left out to stray
No one wants me no place to stay
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Did I do bad or was I good to you
Yes or no Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you goSally Jo
The torch I carried had a light so bright
For me to see Sally Jo
Sally Jo where did you go Sally Jo
Sally Jo Sally Jo
hear my plea come back to me

Standing on the corner with the lowdown blues
A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey let me be your salty dog
   Let me be your salty dog
   Or I won’t be your man at all
   Honey let me be your salty dog
Look it here Sal, I know you
Run down stocking and a wore out shoe
Honey let me be your salty dog
Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
Finger on the trigger and an eye on the hog
Honey let me be your salty dog
Pulled the trigger and the gun set go
The shot fell over in Mexico
Honey let me be your salty dog

Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old san antone
Where in dreams i live with a memory
My rose my rose of san antone
   Lips so sweet and tender like petals fall apart
   Bring back my rose rose of san antone
   Moon in all your spendor know only my heart
   Call back my rose rose of san antone
It was there i found beside the alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Broken song empty words i know
Line in my heart all alone
And that moonlit path by the alamo
And rose my rose of san antone

Standing by the railroad waiting for a train
I’m gonna catch that midnight train and never come back again
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues
I went to the gypsy just to hear what she would say
She said, that girl don’t love you and you’d better be on your way
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
I don’t know where to go, any old place will do
I’m leaving old Sand Mountain, just getting away from you
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
There’s other girls around here and I could love ’em too
But every time I saw you, it’d make me sad and blue
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues
When it makes you lonesome to hear that freight train blow
Then you will know I’m riding, but I didn’t want to go
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues
When it’s raining on Sand Mountain, and raining kind of slow
Then maybe you’ll remember and ?? you make me go
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
I am just a poor boy, and work’s my middle name
I guess that’s why you said goodbye, but I love you just the same
You’re gonna be sorry for breaking my heart
If you ever need me, then maybe I’ll come back
I hear that train a-coming, just coming down the track
It’s a lonesome feeling, Sand Mountain blues

I think of times when I was young
I travelled near and far
It doesn’t seem so long ago
I saw the world from a railroad car
For many years rode the line
Through the woods the freight train would roll
‘Cross fields of grain muddy river plain
My heart would often go
The engineer’s hair is gray
Worn out engine can’t even go slow
I listen for the lonesome sound
Can’t you hear that whistle blow?
I spy ten boxcars silent and still
They remind me of yesterday
Their rusted frames worn and bent
Faded letters read “Santa Fe”
The great steam engines quiet and cold
Metal chimes in the howling wind
The boiler’s busted whistle cracked
Never hear her blow again

If I could be king or a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
I’d rather know that I had salvation
Then to know my reward was Satan’s jewel crown
   Satan’s jewel crown I’ve worn it so long
   But God for my soul has reached down
   His love set me free He made me his own
   And helped me cast off Satan’s jewel crown
This life that I’ve lived so sinful and evil
Drinking and running around
All the things that I do, for the love of the devil
I know my reward is Satan’s jewel crown

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I’d do things my way
But little they know that it’s so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was winning in fortune and fame
I had all that I needed to get a start in life’s game
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
I’m better off now, with a satisfied mind
Cause money can’t buy back your youth when you’re old
Or a friend when you’re lonesome, or a love that’s grown cold
And the wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When this life is ended, my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I’ll leave, there’s no doubt
But one thing for certain, when I’ve served my time
I’ll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

   Got anything good you better save it save it
   Got anything good you better save it save it
   Got anything good you better save it save it
   Baby I might need it some day
They say your cooking is the best in town
Everybody’s been talking around
If it’s so I’m a’coming to town
I’ll let you turn my damper down
You roll your stockings to your knees
Strut around dear as you please
Cuddle up like a turtle dove
If you don’t stop you’ll flub your dub
There’ll come a day when you’re old and gray
When all your friends have strayed away
Then I’ll look at you and say
You had it but it got away
Now stop your honky tonking around
Stop your painting up the town
Change your way from what you did
If you don’t stop I’ll blow my lid

Way back in the mountains way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer they called him fiddlin’ Will
He could play most anything and some say he could sing
But the one thing that he liked to do best was sawing on the strings
So get out the fiddle and rosin up the bow
Look at ol’ Will a tappin’ his toe
We’ll make music til the rafters ring
Old man pickin’ and a sawin’ on the strings
When the neighbors had a shindig and they all had viddles to eat
We’d always have to wait on Will for the frolic to be complete
When he comes down from the mountain all the gals began to sway
Sometimes he’d pick that ol’ 5 string until the break of day
So tune up the five string tighten up the hide
Tell all the young folks to get inside
We’ll make music til the rafters ring
Old man pickin’ and a sawin on the strings

Say little darlin won’t you marry me
Live in a holler neath the old oak tree
Say darlin say
In the old oak tree we’ll make our home
Never more in this world to roam
Say darlin say
Say little darlin if you were mine
You wouldn’t do nothing but starch and iron
Say darlin say
Starch and iron would be your trade
I’d get drunk and lay in the shade
Say darlin say
Say little darlin won’t you marry me
Live in a holler neath the old oak tree
Say darlin say
Live in the holler neath the old oak tree
Children bouncin’ on daddy’s knee
Say darlin say
Hush little darling don’t say a word
Poppa’s gonna buy you a mocking bird
Say darlin say
If that mocking bird don’t sing
Poppa gonna buy you a diamond ring
Say darlin say
If that diamond ring is brass
I’m gonna buy you a looking glass
Say darlin say
If that looking glass gets broke
Poppa gonna buy you a billy goat
Say darlin say
If that billy goat won’t pull
Poppa’s gonna buy you a cart and bull
Say darlin say
If that cart and bull falls down
You’re still the sweetest baby in town
Say darlin say

Can’t you hear the nightbirds crying
Can’t you hear that lonesome dove
Sayin’ won’t you come back darling
To the only one you love
   Meet me out on the mountain
   Underneath the lonesome pine
   Where we vowed we’d love each other
   Darlin’ say won’t you be mine
Where the mountain laurels blooming
And the wildwood blossom grow
There we vowed to love each other
In our childhood long ago
Then I left my little darling
Lord I’ve rambled for too long
Many times I prayed to see her
Now I’m on my way back home

I’m ready now to settle down
All my travelin’ days are over
Darlin’ Darlin’ oh my love
Say you’ll take me back once more
Another’s love has wrecked my life
She stole my love for you away
And now I beg you to forgive
And take me in your heart to stay
Your lovin’ heart has turned to stone
I know your love for me is cold
But now I need you oh so much
To love with all my heart and soul
I’m ready now to settle down
All my travelin’ day’s are o’er
Darlin’ darlin’ oh my love
Say you’ll take me back once more

There’s a story so unkind in the Holy book we find
And it tells how Jesus stood alone one day
False accused and there condemned yet they found no fault with Him
The man who wore the scarlet purple robe
Purple robe my Savior wore oh the shame for me he bore
As He stood alone, forsaken on that day
And they placed upon His head piercing thorns and blood stained red
His raiment was a scarlet purple robe
In the common judgment hall he was mocked and scorned by all
And a tear of sorrow fell upon His cheek
Soldiers of the wicked man smote Him with their evil hand
The Man who wore the scarlet purple robe
Words of truth that day were plain from the lips of Pilot came
In this man I find no reason He should die
But the multitudes replied let Him now be crucified
The man who wore the scarlet purple robe

Fond memory paints us scenes of other years
We need our memories still
And Christ amid those joyous seats and chairs
The school house on the hill
   Oh the school house that stands upon the hill
   I never never can forget
   Dear happy days they gather round me still
   I never no never can forget
There hangs a swing up on the maple tree
Where you and I once swung
There flows the spring forever flowing free
As when we both were young
There climbs the vines and there the berries grow
Which once we prized so high
And there the ripe sun glistened in the grove
Of rich October skies

The day I first met you my heart spoke to me
There is the angel you see in your dreams
And I know it must be for the way that I feel
Your only a dream girl I know your not real
   When you walked away my heart went with you
   You stole it from me the day that we met
   And now I must live my life in sorrow
   No home just a drifter on the sea of regret
The love that you promised to me on that day
Is now gone forever like the vows that you made
My heart is so empty its easy to tell
Like a ship on the ocean I’m lost without sail

You ask me stranger why I made this journey
Why I crossed three thousand miles of rolling waves
Like many others my love was killed in action
So I’m here I’m searching for his grave
Somewhere among these many thousands
Of our Americans who died true and brave
That’s where I know I’ll find him resting
So I’m here I’m searching for his grave
Beside each cross mark here all around me
I’ll kneel down and gladly pray a prayer
For all other loved ones back home across the ocean
Whose heart like mine is buried over here
Somewhere among these many thousands
Of our Americans who died true and brave
That’s where I know I’ll find him resting
So I’m here I’m searching for his grave

The seasons of the heart can’t last forever
And an autumn chill lies in the summer breeze
My love for you is like a raging river
That even the dead of winter cannot freeze 
   Perhaps our pathways will branch around the next bend
   And never more I’ll feel your warm embrace
   But I’ll hold you close forever in my heart, dear
   And in every lover’s eyes I’ll see your face. 
I’ve heard for everything there is a season
And I’ve come to see that winter heralds spring
So if we have to part I’ll try not to regret it
For the love we shared will brighten every thing 
When my last breath on earth is taken
And all my rivers flow down to the sea
I only hope for me it can be written
That I tried to be the best that I could be

   Down by the waterfall
   Where the waters run so cool
   There no secrets ever fall
   From the lips of the fool
Jeniffer was seventeen the same age as I
She had lived next door to us since we were five
She knew I loved her dearly, I told her many times
And I looked forward to the day that she would be all mine
One more year of school we thought, then wedding bells would ring
But the hand of fate has ways of changing everything
I walked upon the two of them down by the waterfall
Jeniffer and Jimmy Jones they saw me not at all
Jimmy Jones was married and had a family
And I just couldn’t understand why they did this to me
Both were scared but all they thought I’d do was tell his wife
Their faces turned to masks of fear before I took their life
People thought that Jeniffer just up and ran away
Jimmy Jones who disappeared is a mystery today
Many years has passed but bitterly I still recall
And only I alone know what’s behind the waterfall

   See God’s ark a-movin’ see God’s ark a-movin’
   Picks me up on my lonely days and carries me through tomorrow
The rain came up hard you know
And the wind began to blow
And I lifted my voice up into the sky
Crying mercy to my soul.
God must have felt my faith
He held me until it was safe
And I never again drew a doubting breath
As he delivered me from my death.
If you can’t resist temptation
If you just can’t put it down
When the ark sets sail on the rolling sea
You’re gonna follow the boat and drown.

Well there’s one kind of favor I’ll ask for you
Well there’s one kind of favor I’ll ask for you
There’s just one kind of favor I’ll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean
And there’s two white horses following me
And there’s two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is under the ground
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And I believe what the father told
And there’s one last favor I’ll ask for you
And there’s one last favor I’ll ask for you
And just one last favor I’ll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

When I am dead and gone from you darling
When I am laid away in my grave
When my spirit is gone to heaven above
To Him whom my soul will save
   Oh the day will come to you darling
   When no more on earth I’ll be seen
   There is one little wish darling grant me
   See that my grave is kept green
   When from this world I go
   Leaving forever the scene
   While others are dead oh will you then
   See that my grave is kept green
Oh the hour of joy is passing
But alas how soon it will fade
Your glances of love are meeting my own
And sunlight will turn to shade
I shall never be happy again my love
Never be happy again
For a girl in her teens don’t know what love means
I shall never be happy again

These are the seeds that my daddy sowed
This is the field that my daddy hoed
These are the crops that blossomed in the fields
That grew from the seeds that my daddy sowed
This is the bank where the money goes
To pay the man that my daddy owes
That sold us the field that blossomed into crops
That grew that from the seeds that my daddy sowed
This is the truth that the farmer knows
At the end of the day you got nothin’ to show
Cause the man who owns the bank is the man who owns the fields
Is the man who owns the seeds that my daddy sowed
These are the seeds that my daddy sowed
This is the field that my daddy hoed
These are the crops that blossomed in the fields
That grew from the seeds that my daddy sowed
 

A boy was writing his sweetheart
She lived in the valley below
Saying your last love letter
Came more than three weeks ago
He didn’t receive no answer
He went down to her home that day
And found she’d been taken to heaven
And this is what he said
    Send me your address from heaven
    So I can write you up there
    Tell me that you still love me
    Tell me that you still care
   
    Mail it on the golden street corner
    As you did on earth here below
    Send me your address from heaven
    So I can write you up there

All night I’ve wrestled Jacob’s angels and prayed with Matthew Luke and John
Struggling to find the words to face the task that comes upon the blood red dawn
I’ve buried men before their time of alcohol and blackened lung
but how to bury seven of these Appalachian miners sons
who stormed the beaches wave on wave and sailed home to these rocky graves
and family plots that bear their names
Tomorrow Ill walk up, seven hillsides
tremble before my flock on seven hillsides
seven sorrows seven sons, seven mothers and every one
will turn to me for the word of God what does this mean
and there I’ll stand good book in hand a shepherd to these precious lambs
what will I say what will I say what can I say
To tell the truth Id never thought much about the will of God before
called to preach at seventeen I was in love with fiery words and not much more
The time has come to keep the faith for others shattered by their loss
remind them of a loving God whose son like theirs paid the cost to save a
sad and wicked world through sacrifice our love is heard and pray that I believe
those words
 

Just seven years ago today
Was when you said good-bye
It broke my heart to see you go
And yet I could not cry
You kissed me sweet and said good-bye
But I could not believe
That you would ever make me cry
Unwanted and to grieve
The sun is slowly sinking down
To make the close of day
To make the end of seven years
The ending of my way
I had no one to stand by me
To count these bitter tears
I could never live these awful blues
Another seven years
I had waited seven years today
To see your face once more
And if my life could be as long
I’d wait ten thousand more

On a long lonesome journey I’m going
Oh darling please don’t you cry
In these shackles and chains they will take me
To a prison to stay ’til I die
   And at night through the bars I will gaze at the stars
   And dream of your kisses in vain
   A piece of stone I will use for my pillow
   While I’m sleeping in shackles and chains
Put your arms through the bars once my darling
Let me kiss those sweet lips I love best
For in heartache you’re my consolation
In sorrow my haven of rest

   Shady Grove my little miss
   Shady Grove my darling
   Shady Grove my little miss
   I’m going back to Harlan
Every time I walk this road
It’s always dark and cloudy
Every time I see that girl
I always tell her howdy
If you see my little miss
If you see my darling
If you see my little miss
Tell her I’m going to Harlan

When you reach that golden city (golden city)
Friends and loved ones you shall see (you shall see)
When the saints come out to meet you (out to meet you)
Oh shake my mother’s hand for me
   Shake my mothers hand and tell her (and then tell her)
   Happy may her spirits be (your spirits be)
   When the saints come out to meet you (out to meet you)
   Oh shake my mother’s hand for me
There are times I often wonder
How can all these trials be
Time can’t keep me here much longer
Oh shake my mother’s hand for me
Over there you’ll meet my Savior
Many loved ones you will see
When you’ve had a talk with Jesus
Oh shake my mother’s hand for me

We moved here from somewhere when i was fourteenWorked this poor ground for bacon and beansLandlord told me that the hard times are nearIt didn’t mean a thing ’cause they’re already here

As I was out walking down by the seashore
I met a fair maiden she sure did look grand
Her lace and her diamonds and her hair shone like gold
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old
Her fingers they jingled like bells on a door
Her nose was turned up but not very much more
When we were married the wedding bells told
I have married a young lady just nineteen years old
When we were married and retired for our rest
My love changed for her why you can guess
For a box full of powders my love did unfold
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old
She raked from her pale cheeks a box full of paint
When she took out her false teeth I thought I would faint
Out upon the carpet her glass eye did roll
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old
She unsnapped her fingers I counted just three
Then she unscrewed both cork legs up to her knees
When she took off her false wig her old bald head told
I had married an old lady about ninety years old

Back to my home town I wanderd one day
It seemed that the old song had drifted away
I wandered down Main Street the view to enjoy
There I met with a girl I had loved as a boy
Gone are the days when our hearts beat as one
All I can say now is see what you done
Gone are the days when we thrilled to each vow
She has forgotten everything now
I still have her picture her face sweet and fair
A rose that she gave me a lock of her hair
I’ll treasure and keep them it’s silly I know
For she has forgotten long long ago

She’s a railroad lady, just a little bit shady
Spending her days on the train
She’s a semi good looker, but the fast rails they took her
Now she’s trying, just trying to get home again. 
 South Station in Boston to the stockyards in Austin
From the Florida sunshine to the New Orleans rain
Now that the rail packs have taken the best tracks
She’s trying, just trying to get home again. 
 She’s a railroad lady, just a little bit shady
Spendin’ her days on the train
Once a pullman car traveller, now the switchmen won’t have her
She’s trying, just trying to get home again. 
 Once a high-ballin’ loner who thought he could own her
He bought her a fur coat and big diamond ring
But she hocked ’em for hard cash, left town on the Wabash
Never thinkin’, never thinkin’ of home way back then 
 Now the rails are all rusty, and the dining car dusty
The gold plated watches have taken their toll
The railroad is dying and the lady is crying
On a bus to Kentuckyand home, that’s her goal 
 She’s a railroad lady, just a little bit shady
Spendin’ her days on the train
She’s a semi good looker, but the fast rails they took her
Now she’s tryin’, just tryin’ to get home again.

She’s just a cute thing
With eyes that sparkle with love
Thinking of her beauties
Oh how I wish I could hug
She’s not the kind you picture
In any walk of life
And I can see her only
As my beloved wife
I courted her in high school and there I won her love
I swore her in high school and there I won her love
And then I joined the service I lived to serve my time
And then a guy met her with eyes that seemed like mine
I scorned for this action
And now might say that we’re through
But trying to forget her
Is more than I can do

She’s there at the bar every evening
Face powdered and cheeks painted red
Her beauty has faded too early
Brought on by the fast life she’s led
   She’s more to be pitied than scolded
   She needs to be loved not despised
   Too much beer and wine, too many good times
   The lure of the honky-tonk wrecked her young life
She once was the belle of the ballroom
She’d a made some man a sweet wife
But too many parties, the wrong side of town
Ruined her happy young life

She’s my curly headed baby
Used to sit on Momma’s knee
She’s my curly headed baby
She’s from sunny Tennessee
I have loved her since I met her
More than any tongue can tell
If she ever proves false hearted
I can never say farewell
I am funny about the women
For I’ll tell you what they’ll do
They’ll be crying over your shoulder
And flirtin’ with another too
She’s my curly headed baby
I don’t care what people say
If she leaves me for another
That will be her burying day
I’d rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don’t never shine
Than for her to be some others darlin’
When she promised to be mine

You see her there at the bar cross the room
She looks like an angel with her paint and perfume
You’d like to meet her your conscience says no
Obey your conscience turn around and go
   She’s no angel, no angel, her wings are not real
   She’ll ruin your life if your heart she can steal
   She’ll tell you tales to bring tears to your eyes
   But don’t you believe them for they’re only lies
You think if only she could be your own
You’d be more contented than a king on his throne
You’d better not trust her it’s wrong if you do
She’s broken many hearts and she’ll break yours too

In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia
Lives a girl who is waiting there for me
Many times we have waltzed in the moonlight
And in her lovely arms I long to be
I miss her smile in the moonlight
But I know she misses me too
In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia
I know that her love for me is true

Sometimes I’m battle weary
I forget to use my shield
The arrows pierce my armor
And I stumble in the field.
   A shield won’t do much good if it’s hanging by your side
   Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive.
I’ll think my life is over
But the Lord He comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And He sets me on my feet.
Sometimes you’re battle weary
But the war’s already won
Keep your head and hold your shield high
‘Til your days in life are done.

   Short life of trouble
   A few more words to part
   Short life of trouble dear girl
   For a boy with a broken heart
Remember what you promised
Not more than a week ago
You promised that you’d marry me
Standing in your mama’s door
Now you’ve broken you’re promise
Go marry whom you may
For this old world’s so big and so wide
I’ll ramble back some day
Now you’ve gone and left me
I don’t know what I’ll do
I’d give the world and half of my life
Just to be married to you

   There’ll be shouting on the hills of glory
   Shouting on the hills shouting on the hills
   There’ll be shouting on the hills of glory
   There’ll be shouting on the hills of God
Oh what a blessed reunion
Oh what a blessed reunion
When will we gather over yonder
There’ll be shouting on the hills of God
Now’s the time to make a reservation
Now’s the time to make a reservation
So stop and make your reservation
There’ll be shouting on the hills of God

The birds are sweetly singin
The sun is shinin bright
But in our place of toiling
It is as dark as night
   Shut up in the mines at coal creek
   I know we’re bound to die
   But if we’ll follow Jesus
   Our souls to heaven will fly
Oh I see my loved ones
My wife is in distress
She does not know that her husband
Is going home to rest
The sky is falling my darling
And death is right at hand
I’m going home to heaven
To live in a better land

There are people who would rather live in mansions
People who would rather live abroad
People who would trade God’s promise
For the glories to hold.
There are people who would rather live in splendor
And brag about their silver and their gold
But I’d rather have a little log cabin
By the side of the road.
   I’d rather live by the side of the road
   And try to point souls to the best abode
   Than to be a king or a millionaire
   And live in mansions in bright array.
I’d rather do a neighborly deed
For a traveler here or a friend in need
I’d rather live by the side of the road
And help some pilgrim along life’s way.
Well I’d rather have a cabin by the roadside
With a pilgrimage of men just passing by
Help to point some soul to Jesus
In that city On High.
Every day I want to help to scatter roses
Every night I want the lamp to shine abroad
With a welcome from the little bay window
By the side of the road.

Just heart beat ago my darling left me
With a good by kiss she sadly broke the news
In her empty chair that’s just across the table
Sits my brand new silent partner called the blues
Her cigarette’s still burning in the ash tray
Reminds me of the pain I put her through
As I watch the front door slowly close behind her
Through the back door walked my partner called the blues
As I look back at the time we spent together
I can see how wrong I’ve been for all these years
For she offered me a lifetime of devotion
In return she’ll walk a highway paved with tears
I know it’s too late to ask forgiveness
With a love like hers it’s just too much to lose
Now I know that I must start my life all over
With my brand new silent partner called the blues

On one cold and rainy night I was sitting in the light
Of my switchman’s shack on my post on the mountain
The storm was pretty bad and the telegraph was dead
And it was just eleven hours ’til the dawning.
Then much to my surprise the telegraph jumped back to life
As I read the code I thought could this be true
A train was on it’s way headed up the mountain grade
But she didn’t have a captain or a crew.
At the other switch they tried to put her on the mountainside
But she kept on coming up the mountain grade
I quickly doused the light to try to see into the night
Maybe I could spot her headlight in the rain.
She was pounding down the road I could hear her whistle blow
And I thought lord what a high and mournful sound
Then the telegraph beganThere’s a cave-in at the mine
And a hundred men are buried beneath the ground
.
But Lord she’s coming now I see around the bend and straight at me
And her boiler’s glowing red as coal in hell
The headlight’s switching wide searching all the mountainside
But the only sound she’s making is the wail
Then I recognize the train by the number and the name
It’s the Miner’s Silver Ghost Old 41
Then she vanished up the track by the lonely switchman’s shack
Like a mother who is looking for her son
Now I recall the story of the train that went to glory
Over fifty years ago on this same night
She was stealing for the cave-in there were men that needed saving
But she missed the curve and trestle near the mine.
Now every now and then you’ll hear her whistle on the wind
If the mountain slides and many men are lost
It’s the high and lonely wailing searching up and down the mountain
The train they call the call the Miner’s Silver Ghost

I don’t want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every rooom
All I want’s the love you promised
Beneath the halo’d moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheating game 
   Silver thread and golden needles
   Cannot mend this heart of mine
   And I dare not drown my sorrows
   In the warm glow of your wine
   You can’t buy my love with money
   For I never was that kind
   Silver thread and golden needles
   Cannot mend this heart of mine. 
I grew up in faded gingham
Where love is a sacred thing
You grew up in silk and satin
Where love’s a passing game
I know now you never loved me
And I know I was a fool
To think your pride would let you
Live by the Golden Rule.

This old town’s filled with sin it will swallow you in
If you’ve got some money to burn
Take it home, right away we’ve got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn. 
The scientists say it will all wash away
But we don’t believe anymore
Cause we’ve got our recruits and our green mohair suits
So please show your I.D. at the door. 
   This old earthquake’s gonna leave me in the poorhouse
   It feels like this whole town’s insane
   On the thirty first floor a gold plated door
   Won’t keep out the Lord’s burning rain 
A friend came around, tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
But he trusted his crowd, so he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had.

Listen to that rain a-falling
Can’nt you hear that lonesome sound?
My poor old heart is breaking
Since my sweet love ain’t around. 
Lord I think I start to ramble
Got to leave this lonesome town
I can’t stay here any longer
Since my sweet love ain’t around. 
On that train tonight I’ll leave
And don’t ask me where I’m bound
This old town is way too lonely
Since my sweet love ain’t around.

Every minute seems like an hour
Every hour seems like a day
Maybe you don’t realize my darling
But you broke my heart the day you went away
Here’s thing or two to ask the other
Will he love you when your old and gray
Will he hold your hand when old and wrinkled
Like I did the day you went away
Now there will come a time when you’ll be sorry
Sorry for the things you do and say
I am not the blame if you must suffer
Like I did the day you went away

   Sing me a song
   Sing me a song
   When I come to the end of my journey
   I know it won’t be long
   Til I cross death’s silent river
   Don’t cry just sing me a song
As I travel through this life
With its struggle and its strife
Though the days may be weary and long
As I search for happiness I find peace and rest
When I sit down and sing me a song
Though our burdens are not light
Always fighting for the right
Everything seems to always go wrong
We could find peace of mind if together we could find
Time to sit down and sing just one song
When I reach the other shore
Meet loved ones once more
Join in the happy angel throne
If I could forever sing let the hallelujahs ring
I’d be singing a hallelujah song

In this world of sorrow I’ve seen troubles and woe
Way up there in glory Lordy I’ll see no more
For I know my prayers have not been in vain
When I get to glory I’m gonna sing sing sing
When I get to glory I’m gonna sing sing sing
I’m gonna let the hallelujahs ring
I’m gonna praise my blessed Saviour’s name
When I get to glory I’m gonna sing sing sing
Sometimes I get so weary inside
That I recall how my Jesus died
Up there I know there’ll be no more pain
When I get to glory I’m gonna sing sing sing
Up there no tears will blind my eyes
As I walk along by my Jesus’s side
I’ll meet my loved ones all once again
When I get to glory I’m gonna sing sing sing

Oh the little country church where we used to sing and pray
How God would bless us in the old fashioned way
It’s still in my memory oh I can see it now
We would sing all day have dinner on the ground
If the whole would loved Jesus you’d find more people there
Singing rejoicing as they kneel in prayer
Then an old fashioned handshake and gather around
At the Singing all day and dinner on the ground
We would sing those old songs and the preacher would preach
Of how Jesus died for you and for me
You could feel the Great Spirit from Heaven pouring down
At the singing all day and dinner on the ground

There was a little ship
And it sailed upon the sea
And she went by the name of the Merry Golden Tree
And she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
And she sailed upon the lonesome sea
There was a little sailor
Unto his captain said
Oh captain captain what’ll you give to me
If I sink them in the low and lonesome low
If I sink them in the lonesome sea
Two hundred dollars
I will give unto thee
And my oldest daughter I will wed unto you
If you sink them in the low and lonesome low
If you sink them in the lonesome sea
He bowed upon his breast
And away swim he
Till he came the ship of the Turkish Reveille
As she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As she sailed upon the lonesome sea
If it wasn’t for the love
Of your daughter and your men
I would do unto you as I did unto them
I would sink you in the low and lonesome low
I would sink you in the lonesome sea
He bowed his head
And down sank he
Farewell farewell to the Merry Golden Tree
For I’m sinking in the low and lonesome low
For I’m sinking in the lonesome sea

   Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
   Sit down won’t you sit down with the Lord and talk today
   Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
   Sit down won’t you sit down with the Lord today and pray
My family and my friends I know mean a lot
And I know who’s the one who provides it all
It’s Jesus from on high I can praise him til I die
I’m so glad I’ll be with him when I die
You won’t always have this chance so gather while you can
Some of you I know will let it pass
There’s sadness in my heart knowing we will have to part
I’m so glad I’ll be with him when I die

It was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me Lord she went away 
   And now she’s gone but I don’t worry
   ‘Cause I’m sitting on top of the world 
She called me up from down in El paso
Said come back, daddy, Lord I need you so 
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Show me a woman a man can trust 
Mississippi River, long, deep and wide
The woman I’m loving is on the other side 
You don’t like my peaches, don’t you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be 
Don’t you come here running, holding out your hand
I’ll get me a woman like you got your man

Sitting alone in the moonlight
Thinking of the days gone by
Wondering about my darling
I can still hear her saying goodbye
   Oh the moon grows pale as I sit here
   Each little star seems to whisper and say
   Your sweetheart has found another
   And now she’s far far away

It was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me Lord she went away
   And now she’s gone but I don’t worry
   ‘Cause I’m sitting on top of the world
She called me up from down in El Paso
Said come back, daddy, Lord I need you so
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Show me a woman a man can trust
Mississippi River, long, deep and wide
The woman I’m loving is on the other side
You don’t like my peaches, don’t you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be
Don’t you come here running, holding out your hand
I’ll get me a woman like you got your man

I’ll sing you a song of the world and its ways
And the many strange people you meet
From the rich man who’s rolled in his millions of gold
To the poor struggling wretch on the street
But a man tho’ he’s poor and in tatters and rags
We should never affect to despise
But think of the adage remember my friends
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size
There’s the rich man with thousands to spare if he likes
But he haughtily holds up his head
And who thinks he’s above the mechanic who toils
And is honestly earning his bread
But his gold and his jewels he can’t take away
To the world up above when he dies
For death levels all and conclusively shows
That six feet of earth makes us all of one size 
There’s many a coat that is tatter’d and torn,
That beneath lies a true honest heart
But because he’s not dressed like his neighbors in style,
Why “society” keeps them apart;
For on one fortune smiles, while the other one fails,
Yes no matter what venture he tries,
But time calls them both to the grave in the end
And six feet of earth makes us all of one size 
Then when you once see a poor fellow that tries,
To baffle the world and its frown,
Let us help him along and perhaps he’ll succeed
Don’t crush him because he is down,
For a cup of cold water for charity’s sake,
Is remembered with joy in the skies,
We’re all of us human, we’ve all got to die,
And six feet of earth makes us all of one size

Well they tell me my sweetheart now is leaving
A new love I know she has found
To love you and know I’m gonna lose you
I’d rather be six feet under the ground
    Who will take care of my graveside
    Who’s footsteps will come walking around
    Read my name upon the tombstone
    You can bet your life my soul is homeward bound
When the time has come and you are gone dear
You can bet your life I won’t be hangin’ around
I’d rather be in my dark grave dear
I’d rather be six feet under the ground
 

Oh the rain is slowly fallin’
And my heart is so sad
Six more miles I’ll leave my darlin’
Leave the best friend I ever had
Six more miles to the graveyard
Six more miles long and sad
six more miles to the graveyard
Leave the best friend I ever had
Oh I hear that train a comin’
Bringin’ my darlin’ back home
Six more miles to the graveyard
Never on this earth no more to roam
Six more miles to the graveyard
Six more miles long and sad
Six more miles Ill leave my darlin’
Leave the best friend I ever had

When we were young we played together
That’s the way our love began
Now you’re gone dear with another
Now you’re no more than just a friend
   Sixteen years we were married
   I remember the day that we were wed
   Sixteen years is a mighty long time
   Now you’re gone I’m losin my mind
Now the days are long and the nights are lonesome
It seems like years have past and gone
I didn’t know you were unhappy
I didn’t know anything was wrong

Monday’s promises, Tuesday’s lies
Saturday’s parting, Sunday’s fight
Something’s wrong between you and I
Love’s gone wrong that used to be right
   I can feel it slipping away
   Slowly slowly slipping away
   It’ll be gone in a few more days
   If we don’t stop this love of ours from slipping away
Wednesday’s kisses Thursday’s frown
We can’t live three days in a row
Our whole world’s turned upside down
Here we stand watching it go
Roses are red, violets are blue
Sugar is sweet some of the time
This puzzles missing a piece or two
God put grapes, but never the wine

Covered with snow neath the mantle of white
Sleeping so calm while the winter winds blow
Our mother is resting from the day and the night
She sleeps in the grave all covered with snow
    Sleeping neath the gentle snow
    Sweetly she sleeps while the winter winds blow
    Calmly she’s resting neath the mantle of white
    Our mother is sleeping she’s sleeping tonight
There she will sleep til the springtime has come
Sweet fragrant roses will bloom on her tomb
Sleeping so calm while the winter winds blow
She sleeps in a grave all covered with snow
There she will sleep beneath the snow covered mound
Til that glad day when the trumpets shall sound
Then she will wake from her slumber below
And we’ll be reunited to live evermore

All around the cabin door falls little flakes of snow
I’m searching for the foot prints of the one that I loved so
The last time I saw my darling the earth was covered white
And little flakes of snow have faded my sweetheart’s path tonight
   From this cabin she did go I watched her foot prints fade
   I don’t know why she left me I never dreamed she’d go away
   Little snow flakes fell from Heaven from the Heaven way up above
   And paved a way made a snow white grave of the only one I loved
She left a memory of tender love and a picture on the wall
My teardrops now are bigger than the snow white flakes that fall
And each moment I grow weaker sadly gazing at the snow
And I feel that I will fade away with that slow melting snow

The sun it shines bright through this cabin of mine
WIth all of the sunshine some light I should find
But in darkness I linger through the rest of my time
Seekin’ out answers in a bottle of wine
    Cause I’m lonesome so lonesome
    So lonesome I’m losin’ my mind
    Yeah I’m lonesome so lonesome
    I’m lonesome for you all the time
The time’s stacked against me I’m afraid I can’t win
I take one step closer and I’ve lost you again
I wake from a dream that’s so tender and kind
And then it’s straight to the bottle of burgundy wine

Some day when my last line is written
Some day when I’ve drawn my last breath
When my last words on earth have been spoken
And my lips are sealed in death
Don’t look on my cold form in pity
Don’t think of me as one dead
It’ll just be the house I once lived in
My spirit, by then, will have fled
I’ll have finished my time here allotted
But I won’t be in darkness alone
I will have heard from Heaven
The summons to come on home
And when my body is in the grave
Don’t think that I’ll be there
I won’t be dead, but living
In the place Jesus went to prepare
And after all is said and done
Know that my last earnest prayer
Is that my loved ones be ready
Someday to meet me thereBl

I’ve been workin’ out in the rain
Tied to the dirty old ball and chain
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
Some sweet day the’ll turn me loose
From this dirty old calaboose
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
   Some old day
   You’ll wait for me and pray
   Oh dear mother i’ll come home some old day
   Some sweet day the’ll turn me loose
   From this dirty old calaboose
   Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
Oh dear mother I’ve hurt you so
I’ve been cruel to you I know
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
Tell my brother My sister and dad
Tell the dear friends that I’ve had
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day

To us God has bestowed the things that we have come to love
And the Devil brought us trouble that hurt God from up above
We are left to choose the ways temptations are abound
Some things does some things don’t lead us to a higher ground
    Some things does and some things don’t
    Lead us to the stairway to God’s eternal home
    We are left to choose the ways temptations are abound
    Some things does some things don’t lead us to a higher ground
Some men raise their families or spend all their time in bars
Whiskey from the bottle son don’t get you very far
Choose what’s right upset the curve put stock in doin fine
All good things in all good time lead us to paradise

   Somebody loves you, darling
   Somebody loves you, I know
   Somebody loves you dearly
   Why did you let them go
Now somebody came to see me
Somebody came last night
Somebody asked me to marry
And, of course, I said all right
Now, somebody’s tall and handsome
Somebody’s eyes are blue
Somebody’s hair is curly
Somebody’s love is true
There’s going to be a wedding
It’s going to be this fall
So, boys and girls get ready
I’m going to invite you all

In a noisy eastern city sat a lonely lad one night
In a bar room where the wine began to flow
From a table in the corner the young man slowly rised
And he said it’s getting late boys I must go
   For somebody’s waiting for me
   Someone who loves me I know
   There’s a light shining bright in the window
   For somebody’s waiting for me
I suppose you have a sweetheart his companions jovially said
If she’s pretty we would like to see her too
If you’ll only stop your teasing I will show her to you boys
She’s the only sweetheart that I ever knew
From an old brown leather pocketbook a picture he did take
Of a gray-haired lady with a bowed-down head
She’s my mother and my sweetheart and she waits for me tonight
So you see I told the truth boys when I said

Someday you’ll pay for breakin my heart
And then you’ll pay alone
You’ll miss the sweet kiss you’ll need a sweetheart
You’ll think of the one that’s gone
   If you could just feel so lonely and blue
   I know you’d change your mind
   You’ve broken my heart but some sad day
   You’ll pay for love divine
The days may come the days may go
That find you happy still
But when your sins have found you out
You’ll have to pay the bill
So long my dear good luck to you
You’ll never see me again
The happy days that once we knew
Have come to this bitter end

   Somehow tonight I feel lonely my darling
   Somehow tonight I feel blue
   Somehow tonight these tears of mine keep falling
   Come back sweetheart and be true
I thought you’re love was something I could treasure
To brighten my pathway through the years
Now all I can see is darkness in the future
That’s why I long to have you near
I never new what loneliness meant darling
Until I watched you walk away
I long to hear you whisper that you love me
I can’t forget our happy days

Now someone took my place with you
Now you tell me we are through
Someone broke my heart in two
When they took my place with you
   Now someone left me here to cry
   And with each day that passes by
   Now I’m found here alone and blue
   ‘Cause someone took my place with you
In days to come I know you’ll find
When you’ve left me here behind
Someday I’m sure that you will find
You wrecked your life as well as mine
   When it’s too late to make amends
   I’m sure you’ll pay the price and then
   Now you’ll be there alone and blue
   ‘Cause someone took my place with you

When first I heard of a people who claimed
This old time religion was real
I says I’ll go down and look at the crowd
It’s just the weak minded I feel
   But something got a hold of me
   Yes something got a hold of me
   I went there to fight but on that night
   There’s something got a hold of me
I went right down to sit at the door
And the devil said don’t you go in
I said I’ll go in for that cannot hurt
And sit as far back as I can
About that time he got up to leave
And he looked right down upon me
He told everybody how mean I had been
Not thinking so much of me
They sing and shout and they all clapped their hands
And they all got down on their knees
When the fire came from heaven it fell right on me
And then I fell to the floor
So now I’ve learnt and there’s no need to doubt
That the old time religion is real
I have a spirit I’ll never forget
That something got a hold of me

Well I thought I was over you and that my heart was free
I felt like those old memories had finally let me be
So I picked up the phone to call a girl that I once knew
But when she said “Hi” well girl you know I wished that it was you
   Something in my heart sure makes it hard to love again
   Something ’bout the way you broke it just won’t seem to mend
   Something in my mind tells me your memory has to end
   Something in my heart sure makes it hard to love again
It seem like only yesterday you promised you’d be mine
And I sure thought I heard you say until the end of time
Well I guess I was wrong to think your love for me was true
So here I am all broken hearted all because of you

My Sophronie’s from Kentucky, she’s found another man
Can’t even kiss her, can’t even hold her hand
The moon we used to love beneath is still up in the sky
But now I’m just a hotshot with a teardrop in my eye
   Love em and leave em, kiss em and grieve em
   That used to be my motto so high
   Till my Sophronie left me so lonely
   Now there’s teardrops in my eyes
Till Gabriel blows his bugle, I’ll be loving that sweet girl
She means more to me than the whole wide world
I used to be a killer with the women me oh my
But now I’m just a hot shot with a teardrop in my eye

I’ve been here a month or more stuck in this old city
The people that have to call it home they’re the ones I pity
Lord I’m homesick
And the blues are the only songs I ever seem to pick
I get out and walk the street
’til I get blisters on my feet
I’m southbound
I’m all right ’til late at night I’m sitting by my window
Counting sheep but I couldn’t sleep for listening to that train blow
I begin to pine
When I hear that big old engine rolling down the line
I’m going back to spend some time
where I can have fun if I ain’t got a dime
I’m southbound
Southbound she’s burning the ground and I don’t mean maybe
Sure am glad I caught this train cause I’d like to see my baby
I’ve been lonesome
I long to see them hills I come from
Listen to the engine rattle and roar
She’s taking me back home once more
I’m southbound

Oh I know she is waitin by her window tonight
In the cabin at the end of the lane
Where the roses bloom in the sweet month of June
Tell my darlin I’ll be there very soon
   Go tell my sweetheart I’m lonely tonight
   Give her my token of love
   Go tell her please do that my heart is still true
   Drift along drift along southern moon
Drift along southern moon up in heaven on high
As the stars they twinkle in the sky
Rest your weary head on a snow white cloud
As we go drifting by

Standing at the sidetrack at the south end of the town
On a dry hot dusty August day the steam pipe blowing down
The fireman with his long oil can oiling the old valve gear
Waiting for the fast mail train the semaphore to clear.
The engineer in the old high cab his gold watch in his hand
Looking at the water glass and letting down the sand
Rolling out on the old main line and taking up the slack
Gone today so they say but tomorrow he’ll be coming back.
   Oh if I could return to those boyhood days of mine
   And the green light on the southern Southern Railroad Line.
Creeping down the rusty rails of the weed grown branch line
The section houses gray and white by the yard and limit sign
The hoggers call the old highball no more time to wait
Rolling down to Birmingham with a ten car load of freight.
The whistle screamed with a hiss of steam the headlight gleams clear
The drivers roll on the green go getting mighty near
Handing out the orders to the engine crew on time
It’s the Alabama Great Southern AGS Railroad Line.
(Chorus)

Sow ’em on the mountain reap ’em in the valley
Sow ’em on the mountain reap ’em in the valley
Sow ’em on the mountain reap ’em in the valley
‘Cause you’re gonna reap just what you sow
If you been a gambler you better quit your gambling
If you been a gambler you better quit your gambling
If you been a gambler you better quit your gambling
‘Cause you’re gonna reap just what you sow
If you been a tattler you better quit your tattling
If you been a liar you better quit your lying

There are gongs from a gage
Like a beautiful dream
And I seek there in vain
By the meadow and stream
Oft I breathe out your name
To the wind floating by
But the sweet voice is
New to my cry
In the stillness of night
When the stars mildly shine
My heart fondly holds
A communion with God
For I feel though art near
And where e’er I may be
That the spirit of love
Watches over me
Oft the birds in the bower
Now companions I make
Every temple wild flower
I prize for the sake
Deep woods and dark clouds
Can a pleasure impart
For the solitude
Suits my poor heart
Though art gone from a gage
And I will not repine
Here lonely shall meet
In a home that is thine
For I feel though art near
And where e’er I may be
That the spirit of love
Watches over me

Here I stand by this chilly water waitin’ for my final call
Standing by the river looking beyond
Gazin’ toward the land of fadeless beauty o’er the surges rise and fall
Standing by the river looking beyond
    Standing by the river waiting for the boatman
    Listen to the music on the other shore
    I can hear the angels singing out a welcome
    With my friends and loved ones (with my friends have gone before)
Music from the land of endless glory fallin upon my listening ear
Standing by the river looking beyond
Faces of my friends I often vision forms of loved ones oft appear
Standing by the river looking beyond
Shadows of night are swiftly falling lo I hear the boatman’s oar
Standing by the river looking beyond
Many are the voices sweetly calling I must tarry hear no more
Standing by the river looking beyond

It’s me oh Lord – Standin’ in the need of prayer
It’s me oh Lord – Standin’ in the need of prayer 
Not my mother (not my father) it’s me oh Lord
Not the preacher (not the sinner) It’s me oh Lord
Standin’ in the need of prayer 
It’s mighty rough road – Standin’ in the need of prayer
For me to carry my load – Standin’ in the need of prayer 
Help me throught the night – Standin in the need of prayer
Show me which way’s right – Standin’ in the need of prayer 
I’ve been down so long – Standin’ in the need of prayer
I know I been wrong – Standin’ in the need of prayer

Darling will you marry me I asked a maiden fair
I turned my back upon her when I looked she wasn’t there
   She left me standing (standing) on the mountain
   She left me standing way up there
Where the honeybees are buzzing round the flowers there
That is where she vanished somewhere in that mountain air
I just saw the whippoorwill a-talking to a bear
They were both a-laughing ’bout her giving me the air
I would give most anything if once more she’d appear
And tell me that she cared a little for this mountaineer

Stay away from me, you’re causing me trouble
It’s been that way, since from the start
Go on your way, you have another waiting
Stay away from me, you’re breaking my heart
   Oh the sky is blue, and the sun is shinning
   And Autumn leaves have turned to brown
   I loved you so, but I can’t have you
   Stay away from me, stay out of town
Stay away from me, I know what you’re after
Its best if we, stay far apart
You brought me pain, no joy no laughter
Stay away from me, you’re breaking my heart

Tomorrow’s just another day to worry
To wake up my dear and I’ll wonder why
Must a sea of heartache slowly drown me
Why can’t I steal away somewhere and die
    Too many days I spent in deepest sorrow
    Too many nights I’ve laid awake and cried
    Oh how I wish there’d be no more tomorrows
    Why can’t I steal away somewhere and die
Now I find my dear that it’s all over
And I guess I’ll live because I can not die
Maybe the tide of time will cure all heartaches
I guess I’ll just look back and wonder why
    I loved you even though you didn’t want me
    Sometimes I think you didn’t even try
    And now there’s nothing left but burning memories
    Why can’t I steal away somewhere and die

   Steel rails chasin’ sunshine ’round the bend
   Winding through the trees like a ribbon in the wind
   I don’t mind not knowin’ what lies down the track
    ‘Cause I’m lookin’ out ahead to keep my mind from turnin’ back
It’s not the first time I found myself alone at dawn
If I really had you once then I have you when I’m gone
Whistle blowin’ blowin’ lonesome in my mind
Calling me along the never ending meadow vine
Sun is shining through the open boxcar door
Lyin’ in my mind with the things I’ve known before
I’ve lost count of the hours days and nights
The rhythm of the rails keep the motion in my mind

I am a stern old bachelor
My age is forty four
I do declare I’ll never live
With women anymore
I have a stove that’s worth ten cents
A table worth fifteen
I cook my gruel in oyster cans
And keep my things so clean
   Oh little sod shanty
   Little sod shanty give to me
   For I’m a stern old bachelor
   From matrimony free
When I come home at night
I smile and walk right in
I never hear a voice yell out
Or say where have you been
On a cold and stormy night
In a cozy little shack
I sing my songs and think my thoughts
With no one to talk back
I go to bed when ever I please
And get up just the same
I change my socks three times a year
With no one to complain
At night when I’m on peaceful sleep
My snores can do no harm
I never have to walk the floor
With a baby in my arms
And when I die and go to heaven
As all good bachelors do
I will not have to grieve for fear
My wife will get there too

Now I’m so broken hearted I don’t know what to do
I passed you today on the street
And you treated me like a stranger that you never knew
It’s the same every time we meet
You built a stone wall all around your heart
Though my arms ache to hold you as before
You built a stone wall all around your heart
You won’t let me love you anymore
How have I hurt you darling why won’t you say
What have I done to you
For I still worship you dear in the same old way
How could you forget the love we knew

   Stone walls and steel bars a love on my mind
   I’m a three time loser I’m long gone this time
Jealousy has took my young life
All for the love of another man’s wife
But I’ve had it coming I’ve known all the time
No more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mind
Gray-haired warden deep Frisco Bay
Guards all around me leading my way
But I’ve had it coming at the end of the line
No more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mind

I’m going away for to leave you love
I’m going away for a while
But I’ll return to you sometime
If I go ten thousand miles
   The storms are on the ocean
   And the heavens may cease to be
   This world may lose it’s motion love
   If I prove false to thee
Oh who’s gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Who’s gonna glove your little hand
Who’s gonna kiss your ruby red lips
When I’m in a foreign land
Oh see that lonesome turtledove
As he flies from pine to pine
He’s a mourning for his own true love
Just the way I mourn for mine

I scarcely hear the wild wind’s cry or feel its sudden blast
A greater storm just swept my world apart
Today you’re with someone new my hopes are gone at last
There’s stormy horizons in my heart
Rain sweept and tattered like the rose in the wind
Stormy horizons without and within
You were all that mattered but you wanted to be free
Now stormy horizons wait for me
Of things as fragile and as sweet as roses dreams are made
And dreams we had you held so carelessly
They fell like petals round my feet I saw my rainbow fade
Now stormy horizons wait for me

Though a pilgrim on earth I may journey alone
Knowing not what the future may hold may hold
I’d rather have Jesus and sing a sweet song
Than to covet their silver and gold
   Stormy water around me and the tempest and fury may roll
   But I have my dear Saviour how he helps me nobody can know
   When it seems I’m forsaken and my earthly friends misunderstand
   Stormy waters surround me but I’ll hold to God’s unchanging hand
Angry billows may toss me and cause me to fear
Stormy waters around me may roll
I will hold to the hand of my Saviour so dear
He’s the Shepherd that’s keeping my soul
Though I have disappointments so often I sigh
And my cabin is humble and bare
But someday I’ll inhearit a mansion on high
Where the beauties of heaven I’ll share

It’s a long steel rail and a short cross tie
I’m on my way back home
I’m on that train the king of them all
That streamline cannonball
   She moves along like a cannonball
   Like a star in it’s heavenly flight
   The lonesome sound of the whistle you love
   As she travels through the night
I can see a smile on the engineer’s face
And although he’s old and gray
A contented heart the waits for his call
On the streamline cannonball
The headlight beams out in the night
And the firebox flash you can see
I ride the blinds it’s the life that I love
Lord it’s home sweet home to me

   Sugar coated love, you gave me on a plate
   I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
   I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
   That old sugar coated love is something I can’t bite
You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can’t understand what I saw in a sugar coated love
You called me your sugar plum, your baby and your pet
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove
You sure had me fooled, babe, with that sugar coated love

   Summertime is past and gone and I’m on my way back home
   To see the only one I ever loved
   Now the room is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
   Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me back in ol’ Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright it lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved

When the sun of your life has gone down
And the clouds in the west turn to gold
Endless death will to you then have come
If the light has gone out in your soul
   Oh just think how in death you would feel
   With the light growing dim in your soul
   Oh how long it will be oh how still
   If the light has gone out in your soul
When you come to the end of the way
And life’s story for you has been told
Oh how sad all to you will appear
If the light has gone out in your soul
When the chilly winds of death around you steal
And the sweat upon your brow is damp and cold
What a dread in your life you would feel
If the light has gone out in your soul
When before the judgment trial you shall stand
And the deeds of your life have been told
Good and evil appears oh what then
If the light has gone out in your soul

   Sundown and sorrow has found me
   Memories are making me blue
   Here with these shadows around me
   I can’t forget loving you
Nothing but daydreams to haunt me
Dreams that could never come true
It’s hard to know you don’t want me
I can’t forget loving you
Ever so long I’ve been yearning
Wondering just what I could do
Deep in my heart there’s a burning
I can’t forget loving you
Night finds me heartsick and crying
Day makes me think of you too
I know there’s no use denying
I can’t forget loving you

There’s a dark and a troubled side of life
There’s a bright and a sunny side, too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view. 
   Keep on the sunny side alwys on the sunny side
   Keep on the sunny side of life
   It will help us every day it will brighten all the way
   If we keep on the sunny side of life. 
 The storm and its fury broke today
Brushing hopes that we’ve cherished so dear
Cloud and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear. 
 Let us breathe with a song of hope each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Saviour away
He keepeth everyone in his care.

Now don’t forget me little darling while I’m growing old and gray
Just a little thought before I’m going far away
I’ll be waiting on the hillside where the wild red roses grow
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall
Now don’t forget about those days we courted many years ago
Don’t forget all the promises you gave me and so
I’ll be waiting on the hillside on the day that you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall
Tell me darling in your letter do you ever think of me
Please answer little darling tell me where you can be
It’s been so long dear since I’ve seen you but my love still lingers on
Don’t forget me little darling though our love affair seems gone

When our hearts are bound in sorrow
And it seems all help is gone
Jesus whispers do not falter
I will lead you not alone
Then somehow amidst my trials
How it is I cannot see
Then I hear a voice from heaven
Gently saying follow me
   There is sunshine in the shadows
   There is sunshine in the rain
   There is sunshine in our sorrows
   And our hearts are filled with pain
   There is sunshine when we’re burdened
   There is sunshine when we pray
   There is sunshine heavenly sunshine
   Blessed sunshine all the way
Sometimes my friends forsake me
And I’m tempted to despair
Then I think of my dear savior
To lay his head he had no where
Oh it pays to follow Jesus
Just to learn of him each day
And I’ll guarantee you my brothers
You’ll have sunshine all the way

   Sweet as the flowers in May time
   Sweet as the dew on the rose
   I would rather be somebody’s darling
   As a poor girl who nobody knows
Oh momma scolds me for burning
What else has a poor girl to do
Oh this world would be sad without a lover
And this world would be sad without you
Oh I wish I had someone to love me
Someone just to call me their own
Be the rule over somebody’s kitchen
Or the queen over somebody’s home
Oh what is the use of us parting
Where there’s a will there’s a way
Tomorrow the sun may be shinning
Although it is cloudy today

Springtime is coming sweet lonesome bird
Your echo in the woodland I hear
Down in the meadow so lonesome your singing
While the moonlight is shining so clear 
But I know he’s away in a far distant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to me 
   Sweet fern, sweet fern
   Oh tell me, is my darling still true
   Sweet fern, sweet fern
   I’ll be just as happy as you 
Oh tell me sweet fern, is he thinking of me
And the promise he made long ago
He said he’d return from over the sea
Oh why do the years go so slow 
But I know he’s away in a far distant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to me 
Upon my finger he placed a small ring
On the day he was leaving his home
I promised I’d be his own little girl
And love him wherever he’d roam 
But I know he’s away in a far distant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to me

Darling soon I will be sleeping in the churchyard over there
Where grass and flowers are growing and birds sing everywhere
Where the grass grows above me and spring flowers gentry wave
Will you do this darling plant sweet flowers on my grave
From you sweetheart I’m leaving your smile I’ll never more see
Darling don’t grieve when we’re parted pretty flowers will speak to me
I will dream that you will be near me as the blossoms gently wave
Will you do this darling plant sweet flowers on my grave
When the golden bond is broken and they lay me down to sleep
This will be the only token of our love I will want to keep
That when I leave you darling this one little wish I crave
In memory of our love dear plant sweet flowers on my grave

   Got sweet heaven in my view hallelujah
   On my journey I press on praise the lord
   For I’m bound for that holy city
   Got sweet heaven in my view
Oh my mother she died and left me
I’m alone in this world I’m alone all alone
And my father he wont own me
Got to find me another home
Oh you need not talk about me
Just because I am crippled and blind
For I’ve got my ticket purchased
I’ll reach heaven on time
And when I get to heaven
Take a seat and sit right down
Looking up to my heavenly father
Looking for a robe and a crown

Who makes me forget all the other girls I’ve met
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Who’s sweeter to me that she really ought to be
Sweet little miss blue eyes
   Little miss blue eyes looks so good
   I’m gonna bring her to the neighborhood
   I’m gonna make every girl in town
   Jealous when she’s around
I’m walking the line ’cause I’m glad that she’s mine
I’m living in paradise
I know I can’t go wrong by just stringing along
With sweet little miss blue eyes
Who’s gonna start taking care of my heart
She makes me realize
It’s love, she’s for me, and I really want to be
With sweet little miss blue eyes

Take me back to the place where I first saw the light
To that sweet sunny south take me home
Where the mockingbird sings me to sleep every night
Oh why was I tempted to roam
I think with regret of the dear home I left
Of the warm hearts that sheltered me there
Of wife and of children of whom I’m bereft
Of the old place again do I sigh
Take me back to the place where the orange trees grow
To my plot in the evergreen shade
Where the flowers from the river’s green margins did grow
And spread their sweet scent through the glade
Take me back let me see what is left that I know
Could it be that the old house is gone
Dear friends from my childhood indeed must be few
And I must face death all alone
The path to our cottage they say has grown green
And the place is quite lonely around
I know that the smiles and the forms I once knew
Now lie ‘neath the cold mossy ground
But yet I return to the place of my birth
Where the children have played ‘round the door
Where they gathered wild blossoms that grew ‘round the path
Twill echo their footsteps no more
Take me back to the place where my little ones sleep
Where poor massa lies buried close by
O’er the graves of my loved ones I long for to weep
and rest there among them when I die

Just as far as I can remember
She’ll remain the rose of my heart
Mama fell sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts
The reason we’ve not called a family reunion
We knew that she wouldn’t be there
But now that we’ve thought it all over Mama
We know you’re spirit is here 
   Oh no I can’t forget the hours your the only one Momma
   And sweeter than the flowers
   Oh no there’s no use to bother
   To speak of you now would only hurt Father
   Oh no momma we’ll never forget you
   And someday we’ll meet you up there
We all gathered round and I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But this was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so badly you know
Well it looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh no Mother when I passed by your casket
I didn’t want to remember you dead

One day a mother came to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done
   She did not bring to him parole or pardon free
   She brought no silver, gold no pomp or style to see
   It was a halo bright brought down from heaven’s light
   The sweetest gift, a mother’s smile
Her boy had drifted far from the fireside
though she had pleaded with him each night
Yet not a word did she ever utter
That told her heartaches her smile was bright
She left a smile you can remember
She’s gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those bars around you could never change her
You were her baby and e’er will be

Here’s a story of two childhood sweethearts
And a love that we shared still untold
How our simple little vows they were broken
And a love that I treasured more than gold
   Are you tired of the life that you’re livin
   Does your mind wander back to the past
   Do you think of the love you’ve forsaken
   Darlin true love is too sweet to last
I remember that night in the moonlight
When you said that you’d found someone new
Do you realize the heartache you’ve caused me
You should know that my love was so true
Alone and sad as I’m travelling
I’m lost on this sea of regret
Wandering back to the place of my childhood
And the one that I’ve always loved the best

You told me that your love was true
Sweetheart, I thought the world of you
But now you left me all alone
I have no one to call my own
   Now sweetheart, you’ve done me wrong
   You have left me all alone
   Maybe there will come a time
   Sweetheart, when you will change your mind
I never shall forget the day
When you said you were going away
I couldn’t believe that it was true
After all the love I had for you
This road is rough and rocky too
As I travel on, dear, without you
But I’m still praying for the time
Sweetheart when you will change your mind

I’ll never love another it’s true
Other lips don’t kiss me like you do
Other arms don’t thrill me like you do
Just one more kiss to be with you
Lets be sweethearts again
Just the way we use to be
Lets be sweethearts again
Darling just you and me
Just one more chance with you again
My tortured heart knows how it sinned
One more chance and I’ll be true
Just one more chance with you

   Darlin do you really love me
   Are you the girl I used to know
   Something’s happened to you darlin
   But it pleases me to know
Life is sweet when love is blooming
Like a wild rose on the hill
But when lovers part forever
Where it ends no one can tell
Many lonely nights I’ve travelled
Far across this barren land
Thinking of that peaceful village
Where we once strolled hand in hand
When our journey here has ended
And this life on earth is done
We’ll be sweethearts up in heaven
For me I know you are the one

   Swinging a nine pound hammer all day
   Working for the state ’till my debt I’ll pay
   Listen to my hammer ringing loud and long
   This is how I come to write this sad old song
Well I had a little woman on the Georgia line
I wanted her love but she wouldn’t pay no mind
Told her one night, stole my heart away
Don’t leave me darlin’ or someday you’ll pay
When I found them that evening how my heart did grieve
My darlin and a stranger and they planned to leave
As the shots rang out and his blood ran cold
I cried have mercy on this poor boy’s soul

Where’s that gal with the red dress on some folks call her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me way down in carolina
Take me back to tulsa
I’m too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I’m too young to marry.
Little bee sucks the blossom big bee gets the honey
Poor man picks the cotton rich man gets the money
Always wear a great big smile we neveer do act sour
Travel all over the country playin’ music by the hour
I’d like to go to Tulsa you bet your boots I would
Let me off at archer st and I’ll walk down to Greenwood

   Take me in your lifeboat, oh
   Take me in your lifeboat
   It will stand the raging storm
   Take me in your lifeboat, oh
   Take me in your lifeboat
   It will bear my spirit home. 
 Now come brothers and sisters and don’t fall asleep
We’ll pray night and day or we’ll sink in the deep
Fathers and mothers are prayin’ so well
The Lord won’t you take me in your lifeboat. 
 The clouds are so heavy the winds are so loud
The thunder are rollin’ and burstin’ the clouds
They pray to their sinner mates for what they have done
They took the dyin’ sinner in their lifeboat.

Take my hand and tell me what I want to know
Won’t you ease my worried mind you know I love you so
Tomorrow they will come and take me far away
Will you keep me in your heart as you’re in mine today
Those prison bars are gonna hold me for a time
The only way to stand the pain is knowing that you’re mine
Though you may hold another please keep your heart for me
Someday I’ll come back to you your love will set me free
The days ahead won’t seem so bad with loving thoughts of you
The lonely nights won’t seem so long with tender dreams so true
I need your love to treasure as I slowly do my time
So take me in your lovin’ arms and tell me one more time

Take my hand and tell me what I want to know
Won’t you ease my worried mind you know I love you so
Tomorrow they will come and take me far away
Will you keep me in your heart as you’re in mine today
Those prison bars are gonna hold me for a time
The only way to stand the pain is knowing that you’re mine
Though you may hold another please keep your heart for me
Someday I’ll come back to you your love will set me free
The days ahead won’t seem so bad with loving thoughts of you
The lonely nights won’t seem so long with tender dreams so true
I need your love to treasure as I slowly do my time
So take me in your lovin’ arms and tell me one more time

I’m happy now at last you are smiling
And I’m glad I have found you in his arms
For no longer I’ll keep you unhappy
And I’ll vow to never do you any harm
Take my ring from your finger
Set me free as a dove
You don’t need me no longer
You have found the one you love
So my heart will likely break when I leave you
When my position at last I can see
When I found you in his arms you were crying
And that’s more than you ever did for me
You can have our little home in the mountains
With the honeysuckles twining round the door
When he carries you over the threshold
I hope that you’ll be happy evermore

   Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
   Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
   Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
   Tell him I’m a-gone, just tell him I’m a gone
If he asks you, was I running
If he asks you, was I running
If he asks you, was I running
Tell him I was flying, tell him I was flying
I don’t want your old darn shackles
I don’t want your old darn shackles
I don’t want your old darn shackles
It hurts my leg, hurts my leg
I don’t want no greenback dollar
I don’t want no greenback dollar
I don’t want no greenback dollar
It hurts my pride, hurts my pride

Well, God spoke to Moses at the burning bush
Burning bush, Lord the burning bush
God spoke to Moses at the burning bush
Saying I am the Lord, thy God
   Take your shoes off Moses you’re on holy ground
   Holy ground, you’re on holy ground
   Take your shoes off Moses you’re on Holy ground
   For I am the Lord, thy God
Go yonder Moses and smite that rock
Smite that rock, Lord smite that rock
Go yonder Moses and smite that rock
For I am the Lord, thy God
Stand still Moses see salvation work
Salvation work, see salvation work
Stand still Moses and see salvation work
For I am the Lord, thy God

   Talk about sufferin’ here below
   And lets keep a-lovin’ Jesus
   Talk about sufferin’ here below
   And let’s keep followin’ Jesus 
 The gospel train is coin’
Now don’t you want to go
And leave this world of sorrow
And trouble here below 
 O can’t you hear it father
And don’t you want to go
And leave this world of sorrow
And trouble here below 
 Oh can’t you hear it mother…. 
 Oh can’t you hear it brother…..

Now people seem to watch my footsteps as I go by
They shake their heads and say I’m riding high
But this thing has done drove me wild and now it’s got me down
And made me the talk of the town
   I’ll go down to the river and slowly walk around
   And if my thoughts don’t change a lot I’ll jump right in and drown
   For after what you’ve done to me I know I’ve grown to be
   The laughing stock the talk of the town
I used to think this couldn’t happen to a guy like me
As nightfall finds me headed to your door
Now you don’t seem to want me since a new love you have found
And now I am the talk of the town

Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain
And planted some pines in the sand
Every day I looked their way
But just couldn’t understand 
Why they never grew like I thought they should do
I just couldn’t understand why
Now I’ve rambled around this wide world through
And today I just happened by 
   Tall pines, tall pines
   Reaching up for the clouds
   Tall pines, tall pines
   I bet you wouldn’t know me now. 
I’ll never forget the morning I left
The hum of the bees in the hay
The farther I walk, the harder they talk
How silent it seems here today 
There’s an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch
Surrounding the old family graves
And there’s one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade 
   Tall pines, tall pines
   Reaching up for the clouds
   Tall pines, tall pines
   I’ve come home to sleep beneath your boughs.

Put no stone at my head, no flowers on my tomb
No gold plated sign In a marble pillared room
The one thing that I want when they lay me in the ground
When I die tear my still house down
   Oh tear my still house down let it go to rust
   Don’t leave no trace of the hiding place
   Where I made that evil stuff
   For all my time and money no profit did I see
   That old copper kettle was the death of me
When I was a child way back in the hills
I laughed at the men who tended those stills
But that old mountain shine it caught me somehow
When I die tear my still house down
Oh tell all your children that hell ain’t no dream
‘Cause Satan he lives In my whiskey machine
And in my time of dying I know where I’m bound
When I die tear my still house down

Those heartaches now are on my way
What makes you want to be that way
You cheated on me and you lied
You put teardrops in my eyes
   I found out what they say is true
   I hope someday that you’ll be blue
   And then you’ll know dear why I cry
   With these teardrops in my eyes
I heard the rumors all around
That someday you’d let me down
I turn my head when gossip flies
Cause it puts teardrops in my eyes
I never thought you’d let me down
But now at last I understand
You wrecked our life and broke our vows
You’ll have to pay for it somehow

Tonight I’m so lonesome heartbroken and blue
I’d give all this world one more to see you
Each night my pillow from tears is all wet
I’m cryin’ my heart out these tears of regret
   Tears of Regret I’m shedding for you
   To wallow in my heart no good would it do
   Tears that are fallin’ won’t make you return
   Tears of regret while alone I must yearn
If you’re ever lonely and think about me
Remember my darlin’ no pleasure I’ll see
I look to the future through tears of regret
I’ve lost you forever but I’ll not forget
Come back to me darlin’ I’m waitin’ for you
I promise forever this time to be true
I lost a treasure more precious than gold
Now tears of regret is my payment I know

I’m alone tonight my darling
With another you have gone
Yet you tell me that you love me
That you’ll always be my own
Yet no promise do you give me
When I beg you to be true
You just leave me sadly weepin’
Broken hearted over you
Tell me now or tell me never
You must answer me somehow
For I’ve grown so tired of waiting
Waiting for your solemn vow
I have always loved you darling
And I tried to make you care
But you’ve run around with others
Leaving my life cold and bare
With no promise for the future
You have left me here to cry
You must tell me little darling
Let your conscience be your guide

We parted by the riverside
The moon looked down on you and me
The stars put on a look of pride
The river murmured to the sea
The dew drop kissed a blushing rose
The mournful wind did sigh
One word broke nature’s sweet repose
That sad word was goodbye
   
   Oh tell me that you love me yet
   For oh this parting gives me pain
   Please tell me that you’ll not forget
   For we may never meet again
We parted by the riverside
Though I have roamed in distant climes
My heart has not forgot it’s pride
For I have loved you all the time
And I am faithful to you still
As long as you are true
Let day each bring to me what it will
For I love you only you

A little tot was playing one night upon the floor
Her mother sat and id’ly watched the little girl of four
All at once she dropped her toys and tears begining to shed
She climbed upon her mother’s knee and this is what she said
   Tell my why my daddy don’t come home
   I know that I am much to big to cry
   Why don’t he come and play with me again
   Mommy why did daddy say goodbye
That night she wrote a letter to one whose name she bore
She asked him to forget the past and come back once more
Your little girl is pleading and calling Daddy’s name
Won’t you please come back again so she won’t have to say

Ten Years or more I’ve waited
For you to change your ways
But starting today it’s all over
The price is more than I can pay
Ten Years seems like ten million
I’ve knelt at your command
But now it’s too late things are different
The price is more than I can stand
Ten lonesome years filled with heart aches
For me is what you planned
But I’ve had enough so I’m leaving
The price is more than I can stand
The past will soon be forgotten
I’ll find a new love so grand
Now it’s too late it’s all over
Ten Years is more than I can stand

Sometimes when I’m feeling lonesome and none on earth seems to care
I’m all by myself in the darkness with no one and nothing to share
Just when it feels like it’s over and I’ll never make it alone
I hear the voices of angels tenderly calling me home
   Home come on home
   Ye who are weary come home
   Softly and tender they call me
   Home come on home
I try to keep it together and I never let on that I’m scared
till sometimes I fall to pieces scattered and lost everywhere
and just when it feels like it’s hopeless and I’ll never make it alone
I hear the voice deep inside me it’s tenderly calling me home
Don’t be afraid of the darkness don’t run away from the storm
stand up and face your reflection and feeling’s you try to ignore
cause after the tempest is over and you let yourself go on thru
you’ll hear a voice in the silence it’s tenderly calling to you

You have heard and read about the state of Tennessee
Down in the southern states is where I want to be
Where the valleys are so green and the mountains are so tall
You will know just what I mean when you hear them say “Y’all”
   Tennessee (Tennessee)
   I hear you calling me (I hear you calling me)
   The home of Davey Crockett in the hills of Tennessee.
When I was a little boy around the folks back home
My mother always said to me Jimmy, please don’t roam
Now that I have gone away my heart is full of woe
When I think of Mom and Dad that’s where I want to go
If ever I get back to that state of Tennessee
I tell you there’ll be no more roaming for me
There lives a sweetheart who said she’d marry me
As soon as I get back to that state of Tennessee

I wonder if It’s rainin’ in the mountains
I wonder how the old town looks today
And if the church is there beside the river
Could I go back and find where mama lay
Does life still go to sleep just after sunset
Are the berries still as big on the vine
Do old men sit and talk about the old days
The way they did in 1949
   Oh Oh Oh how I’d like to be
   Back in the hills of Tennessee
   Oh Oh Oh it would be so fine
   If I could just go back to 1949
I wonder if by chance they might remember
A teenage boy so wild and fancy free
Who always loved guitars and country music
If I went back would they remember me
I wonder what became of Kathern Ackers
The girl who broke my heart at seventeen
I barely can remember what she looks like
Thirty years ago she was my dream
chorus
For many years I’ve searched the wide world over
For what
I don’t recall and didn’t find
And now I’m searching pictures in my memory
For Tennessee 1949

If I had my way I’d leave here today
I’d leave in a hurry
I’d find me a place where I could stay
And not have to worry 
   A place I could use
   A place I could lose the Tennessee Blues 
 I’d find me a spot on some mountain top
With no one around me
Valleys and streams, birds in the trees
And hills that surround me. 
 I’d try to forget all my regrets
I’d keep just the good times
I’d wake and I’d sleep, nothing but peace
Feel free all the time.

A cat wouldn’t give him a chance
But When he stretches his long legs out
A fox ain’t got a cahnce

Sad faced mooneyed creature
His ears hang down to his knees

An old aged home for fleas

But when he gets a certain kind of look on his face
The she hounds run for a hiding place
Cuz when he takes a notion all the girl dogs know
He’s a dynamite up tite outa sight backyard romeo
He looks like ugly warmed over
Some dog lovers have said that
But he’s got more sense in the end of his nose
That they’ve got in their head

Sittin’ on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straight-back chair on two legs leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playin’ with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin’ fireflies when evening shadows fall
   In my Tennessee mountain home
   Life is as peaceful as a baby’s sigh
   In my Tennessee mountain home
   Crickets singing in the fields near by
Honeysuckle vines cling to the fences along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings
And a songbird on a fence post sings a melody
Drivin’ home from charch on Sunday with the one you love
Just laughin ‘talkin’ makin’ future plans
And when the folks ain’t lookin’ you might steal a kiss or two
Just sittin’ in the porch swing holdin’ hands

I’m a Tennessee truck driving man
Tennessee truck driving man
I packed the load and I know the road
I’m a Tennessee truck driving man
I leave the terminal loaded
Heading for the eastern seaboard
There ain’t a thing between me and the end of the run
But this highway this truck and my load
I keep the long haul steady
Making my stops on the run
Then I’ll break her down turn her around
To get back to my home base on time

   Those Texas bluebonnets how sweetly they grow
   For all the wide prairies they’re scattered like snow
   They make all the meadows as blue as the skies
   Reminding me of my little darlings blue eyes
Well I wanted to ramble so I started to roam
And I didn’t think twice about leaving my home
But when I got to Texas not far from Burnet
Those Texas bluebonnets wouldn’t let me forget
I ran out of money went to work on a farm
Picking their melons and hoeing their corn
And all winter long Lord I herded their cows
And I tried to forget my little darling somehow
But then springtime had blossomed
And it just made my head feel bluer than blue
Those Texas bluebonnets they smiled in the sun
But they just made me think of my only one
I’m leaving the southland I’m leaving today
I don’t know where I’m going but I know that I can’t stay
I guess I’ll go north to the ice and the snow
Where those Texas bluebonnets never will grow
In the cold frozen Iceland I’ll live ’til I die
Where I’ll finally forget my little darlings blue eyes

All my life I’ve wondered if what I’ve done was wrong
All I ever cared to do is ride my pony on
I never had no heartaches, was always happy and gay
Until I met a Texas girl who stole my heart away. 
   Where the sleepy Rio Grande goes slowly to the sea
   It was there she promised to be mine throughout eternity
   But the angels they grew jelous of her beauty and her smile
   And came along one stormy night and stole away my bride
   The birds have hushed their singing, sadness is over the land
   Little birds miss my darlin’ by the sleepy Rio Grande. 
Her lips were like the russian wine, her hair it hung in curls
Her cheeks were like the dawn of day that breaks upon the world
She’s gone and left me lonely, I miss the touch of her hand
Tonight while I am walking by the sleepy Rio Grande.

   THANKS THANKS A LOT
   I GOT A BROKEN HEART AND THAT’S ALL I GOT
   YOU MADE ME CRY AND I CRIED A LOT
   THEN YOU WERE GONE HONEY THANKS A LOT
YOU TOLD MY FRIENDS AS I WAS PASSIN’ BY
THAT YOUR NOT SORRY THAT YOU MADE ME CRY
YOU SAID I DESERVED EVERYTHING I GOT
IF THAT’S THE WAY YOU FEEL HONEY THANKS A LOT
YOU WANTED A FOOL AND I PLAYED THE PART
ALL I GOT IS A BROKEN HEART
WE LOVED A LITTLE AND YOU LAUGHED A LOT
THEN YOU WERE GONE HONEY THANKS A LOT
I JUST NEEDED YOUR LOVE
HONEY THANKS A LOT

Many years now have passed since I saw my darling last
But she waits alone there just for me
I’ll be going back some day and I never more will stray
From that girl who stood by me
   I’ve about forgot the tune and the West Virginia moon
   But the North Carolina moon is just as bright
   I’ll n’er forget the time you promised to be mine
   The moon was shining down that happy night
When I left her all alone in our little mountain home
I never thought of the day I’d return
Now I’m coming back to you love I know you’ve been true
What a price I’ve paid to live and learn

Oh the home above (oh the home above) so far away (so far away)
That’s where we pray (As ) we’ll live someday (we’ll )
In the home above (in ) beyond the starlight sky (beyond)
Where the soul of man (where) will never die (will)
   I’m ready to leave (I’m ) this world below (this )
   To the home above (to ) I’m ready to go (I’m)
   Then mother will say (then) welcome home our son (welcome)
   In a heavenly home (in ) our life has just begun (our)
Oh my mother and dad (oh) have gone on before (have)
They’re waiting for me (they’re) on the heavenly shore (on)
I long to see (I ) and shake their hand (and)
When I’m safe at home (when) as they had planned (as)
Oh the beautiful land (in ) where we’ll never die (where)
That’s where my soul (that’s) shall rest on high (shall)
I’ll sing and shout (I’ll) for His face I’ll see (for)
With God I’ll rest (with) for eternity (for)

Sweetheart I recall the day I first met you
I wonder if you remember the same
We talked of the love we shared for each other
And longed for the day we’d change your sweet name
   I can still hear your voice in the evening
   I see your sweet face your blue eyes so bright
   God took you away and left me so lonely
   The angels are singing in heaven tonight
As the years passed away we cherished each other
No worries or cares to darken our day
From our little home up in the Clinch Mountains
The saviour came down and called you one day
I’ll always be true and love you my darling
But I know you are happy and healthy up there
When God calls me home I’ll meet you in heaven
Please wait for me darling I’ll meet you up there

In the hills of old Virginia there’s a mountain
Where the trees still bud so pretty in the spring
Where I met and fell in love with one so sweetly
Joy and gladness to my heart she then did bring
Underneath a beech nut tree there in the mountains
Where we met and told each other of our love
There we promised to each other we would marry
As the little birds sang sweetly up above
This is one song that had a happy ending
For we’re married now and in her eyes I see
All the love and Oh how sweetly she remembers
Where we made our vows beneath the beech nut tree

If you look out your window as the sun’s goin’ down
I’ll be there by the side of the road
And I’ll ride you away from the dirty ol’ town
An ne’er again leave you alone
For you were the bird that I held in my hand
Til I learned to fly on my own
You’re a garden in this god forsaken land
And the only true love I have known
The morning was frozen the sky was still dark
When I last laid eyes upon you
I know the ache you have known in your heart
And darling I have felt it too

There was a girl I loved so dearly
She lived away back in the hills
When the bluebird sings I miss my darling
She loved me I know she always will
   There’s a bluebird singing (bluebird singing)
   In the Blue Ridge Mountains (Blue Ridge Mountains)
   Calling me back to my home
   Oh I can hear (I can hear)
   Those bluebirds calling
   Calling me back to my home
When I reached my home I was oh so lonely
The one I loved had gone away
That sad news came from her mother
She’s sleeping there beneath the clay
Now tonight I’m far from the Blue Ridge Mountains
Far from my home back in the hills
I’m going back to the Blue Ridge Mountains
These memories they haunt me still
Chorus

Once I was happy as I could be
But I let a gal make a fool of me
And ever since she let me down
The blues come around when the sun goes down.
   Oh the blues come around
   Oh the blues come around
   Lord the blues come around
   Every evening when the sun goes down.
As long as the sun is in the sky
These dog-gone blues never make me cry
But ever since she left this town
The blues come around when the sun goes down.
I built my castles very high
And then she went and said good-bye
And ever since she tore ’em down
The blues come around when the sun goes down.
Once she called me all her own
But now she’s gone and I’m alone
And every evening I’m sorrow bound
‘Cuz the blues come around when the sun goes down.

You went away to leave me here
To find somebo-dy new
You’re hap-py now with your new love
And I’m alone and blue
   Shadows a creepin’ around my door
   The sun will soon go down
   The nightbirds are cryin’ away on the mountain
   I’m the blu-est man in town
You took away your lovin’ arms
You wrecked our hap-py home
You left me with a brok-en heart
So blue and all alone

I can hear the voice of the boatman comin’
And I’ll be ready when he calls my name
So happy I’ll be on my way to Heaven
I hear the Angels freely say
   Oh the boat of love down at the harbor
   It’s waiting there for you and me
   I have no fear Christ is the captain
   He’ll guide us o’r life’s rollin’ sea
Let’s get on board that great excursion
And sail the sea to the home above
Don’t wait too late to make your reservation
It’s the boat of God’s eternal love
Oh the boat of love will soon be sailing
It’s headin’ for that golden shore
Don’t wait too late to make your reservation
Heaven is my home for evermore

Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Portland Main is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat is Home Sweet Home to me
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
Went down to the depot and I looked up on the board
It read it’s good times here but better on down the road
Eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
Eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
I’m going to get me a Momma
Lord I ain’t never seen
Where was you Momma when the train left the shed
Where was you Momma when the train left the shed
Standin’ in my front door wishin’ to God I was dead

We have been so close together
Each a candle, each a flame
All our dangers were outside us
And we knew them all by name 
   See how the bramble and the rose
    Intertwine
   Love grows like a bramble and a rose
   Round each other we will wind 
 Now I’ve hurt you and it hurts me
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other
Without really meaning to 
 So put your arms around me
And we’ll sing a true love song
One that we can sing together
Play and sing it all night long.

She went upstairs to make her bed
And not a word to her mother she said
Her mother she went up there too
Dear daughter dear daughter what’s wrong with you
Oh mother oh mother I can not tell
That butcher boy that I love so well
There’s another girl in another town
He goes out there and he sits right down
That night her father came home from work
Sayin’ mother dear mother where is my girl
He went upstairs to give her hope
And he found her hanging from a rope
Then he took his knife and he cut her down
And in her bosom these words he found
Go did my grave both wide and deep
With marble stones at my head and feet
In the middle of my grave put a snow white dove
To show this world that I died for love

   My heart it is aching you should be ashamed
   The children are crying and calling your name 
Well since you went away dear, I’ve felt so all alone
Well you left me the children but you’ve broken up our home
But you couldn’t stop your cheating or running around
And now my friends are talking ’bout how you let them down
Well oh mommy oh daddy I think that it’s a shame
Well I know you both love me but I don’t know who’s to blame
But you couldn’t stop your cheating or running around
And now my friends are talking ’bout how you let them down

What memories come back to me
As I ponder o’er the years passed away
If I could be back in that old country church
And once more hear the parson say
We’ve travelled on together
Though dark and sunny days
And may we always be together
Just my Lord and I along the way
I can see the service now ending
And the parson’s voice is raised
In solemn quiet benediction
Upon our different ways

Don’t run to me when he’s not around
Don’t come slippin’ ’round my door
I tried not to see how you’re using me
We played that little game before
   You call me up when he’s out of town
   The next day you treat me like I’m just some hand me down
   Is that any way for a good girl to act
   I guess I’ll have to face the cold hard facts
Day after day of livin’ this a-way
Will take a toll on a man
And night after night lie after lie
Stringin’ me along must be your plan
Well fools like me they never see
That empty feelin’ that’s in store
When the bitter truth sneaks up on you
She’s headin’ home cut out your door

The cuckoo is a funny bird she sings as she flies
She’ll bring you glad tidings she’ll tell you no lies
She sips from the pretty flowers to make her voice clear
And she’ll never sing cuckoo till the spring of the year
A-walking and a-talking and a-wondering go I
A-walking for my true love he’ll come by and by
I’ll meet him in the morning for he’s all my delight
I could walk with my true love from morning to night
Come all you fair maidens take warning from me
Don’t place your affection on a young man too free
For leaves they do wither and roots they do die
And your love he will leave you and he’ll never say why
But if he will leave me I’ll not be forlorn
And if he’ll forswear me I’ll not be forsworn
I’ll get myself up in my best finery
And I’ll walk as proud by him as he walks by me
The Osborne Brothers;

   Don’t you know the day has passed and now it’s time for sleep
   Or won’t your weary heart let you rest
   Don’t you know the day has passed into a darkness deep
   Why do you clutch that picture to your breast? 
Oh this picture holds a memory of a better time
One that seemed so very long ago
As I kneel down by my besdide and begin to pray
I sometimes wonder why 
But you’re right and it’s getting late and time for me to part
As I felt the teardrop well into my eye
To see the old man leaving with a broken heart
With a picture of my mother by her side.

When the fiddler has played his last tune for the night
And the singer has sung his last song
And the mandolins and guitars and banjo’s are quiet
And the loud noisy crowd has gone home
Theres nothing as quiet as a night with no music
Or as dark as night with no stars
And nothing as lonesome as a cold lonely river
Just wondering all night where you are
As we walked together the music was playing
The wind whispered soft through the trees
With your arms around me whispered I love you
And the words seemed to float on the breeze
Now the fiddler has played his last tune for the night
And the singer has sung his last song
All the mandolins and guitars and banjo’s are quiet
Like the music sweetheart you are gone

Springtime is hear my darlin’
You said that you are goin’ away
My heart will be with you my darli’
Then I’m countin’ now the days
I know that soon I’ll have to travel
I know I’m over the hill
I feel so all alone my darlin’ since you’ve been gone
And I heard the first whippoorwill
The flowers are bloomin’ little darlin’
With the buddin’ of the trees
I hear them night birds a-cryin’
I know that they are warnin’ me
Our love was planted little darlin’
Just like the farmer plants his grain
But there will never be a harvest
On the hill a whipoorwill

I was standing by a garden wall
Where the roses bloom in southern skies
You pressed one rose up to your lips
The night we spoke our last goodbye
 Oh the rose you kissed is faded now dear
 And our love is gone since we’re apart
 You went away and left behind
 A faded rose a broken heart
Sometimes I wish we’d never met
Then this true saying I recall
Oh it’s better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
 Oh in dreams it seems that you are near me
 And I hear you say we’ll never part
 Then sweet dreams disappear and leave
 A faded rose a broken heart

 

I walked out one night for to ramble round
I didn’t mean to stay, just to view the town
When I saw her smiling from afar
As she walked into that crossroad bar 
 Well I walked inside and I sat me down
Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it down
She came and sat beside me there
With the dark brown eyes and the red, red hair. 
 I told her that I loved her true
Anything you want, I’ll surely do
She said, “A man like you won’t get too far
With a girl like me from the crossroad bar. 
 “I like the smokey lights and a lonesome song
And I won’t do right if I can do you wrong
You want the moon above and I’m the darkest star
And you won’t find love at the crossroad bar.” 
 Come all my friends, take my advice
Get your love at home, with your lovin’ wife
You’re much better off than you think you are
And you won’t find love at the crossroad bar
And you won’t find love at the crossroad bar.

As I walked in the Wayside Tavern
The smell of drink was in the air
I threw my money on the counter
This pretty maid was standing there
My thoughts they drifted so far from me
As I looked upon her lovely face
I knew she was my kind of woman
No one could ever take her place
I said when working hours are over
I would just love to take you home
She said young man that is a pleasure
And soon we found ourselves alone
And then our arms went around each other
I felt a knife stick in her back
She turned and saw her lover running
And said his name was Barnum Jack
She did not know her lover followed
She did not know he was around
Until the fate of death had struck her
And now she sleeps beneath the ground
I sit alone tonight in prison
My thoughts are of the one so fair
That I met that night in the Wayside Tavern
When the smell of drink was in the air

   The girl I love don’t pay me no mind
   The girl I love don’t pay me no mind
   Oh sweetheart divine put your little hand in mine
   The girl I love don’t pay me no mind
The girl I love done left this town
The girl I love done left this town
She left this town says I’m Alabama bound
The girl I love done left this town
When I’m gone don’t wear no black
When I’m gone don’t wear no black
Oh don’t wear no black for you know I’ll be back
When I’m gone don’t wear no black

I won’t go to a burnin hell
If I believe in what the bible tells
I’ll conquer that old devil if I pray
He offers just brimstone and fire
A lowdown thief a cheater and a liar
But the Lord will give you love and treat you well
    There’s too many miles on me
    To change my ways I cannot see
    Before I die it can’t be far away
    I believe in the God that never fails
    Delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale
    Give me that old time religion that’s for me
I have a promise from God above
The one who gave me this book of love
Says he’ll never leave me or forsake me
And when the devil’s at my back door
I’ll raise my hand and kneel on the floor
I pray that the Lord will lead me through

I won’t go to a burnin hell
If I believe what the bible tells
I’ll conquer that old devil if I pray
He offers just brimstone and fire
A lowdown thief a cheater and a liar
But the Lord will give you love and treat you well
There’s too many miles on me
To change my ways I cannot see

I’ve been sitting here thinking back over my life
All of the good thing the trouble and strife
Well my share of heartaches yes so many I’ve had
But I still think the good things out weigh the bad
Well I’ve rocked my babies at night when they’d cry
I’ve seen the teardrops turn into smiles
And that’s when I realize all the bad luck I’ve had
And I know all the good things out weigh the bad
Well I’ve never had riches or money to spare
Just a share croppers wages is my only fare
Yes making my living just working the land
But I still think the good things out weigh the bad
Yes I worked the cotton in the heat of the day
And then paid the landlord nearly all that I’d made
Well I’ve seen high taxes take all that I had
But I still think the good things out weigh the bad

   Oh the green rolling hills of West Virginia
   Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
   Though the times are sad and drear and I cannot linger here
   They’ll keep me and never let me go.
My daddy said don’t ever be a miner
or a miner’s grave is all you’ll ever own
There’s hard times everywhereI can’t find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I’ve ever known
So I’ll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you’ll find me there
Though I’ll leave the past behind ‘ll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear.
Someday I’ll go back to West Virginia
To those green rolling hills I love so well
Oh omeday I’ll go home and I know I’ll right the wrong
And these hard times will follow me no more.

I remember as a boy how in wonderment and joy
I’d watch the trains as they’d go by
And the whistle’s lonesome sound you could here from miles around
As they rolled across that Greenville Trestle high.
   But the whistles don’t sound like they used to
   Lately not many trains go by
   Hard times across the land mean no work for a railroad man
   And the Greenville Trestle now don’t seem so high.
On the riverbank I’d stand with a cane pole in my hand
And watch the freight trains up against the sky
With the black smoke trailing back as they moved along the track
That runs across that Greenville Trestle high.
When the lonesome whistles whined I’d get rambling on my mind
Lord I wish they still sounded that way
As I turned to head for home Lord she’d rumble low and long
Toward the sunset at the close of day.

I was born upon a hillside
Where the pines sing in the wind
Where my daddy lived before me
And my grandpa before him
We believe in simple livin’
It’s the only life we know
All we need here is our freedom
And a place to call our own
   In the land of Ethan Allen
   Where the sugar maples grow
   Where the wild grass fills the meadows
   And the rocky rivers flow
   By the hills that I call home
Now I have traveled cross the country
And there is much that I have learned
Still I felt no peace inside me
Till the day that I returned
For there’re two things you can count on
In this troubled world we face
Every season has an ending
Every person has a place

He saw my sin and knew they would keep me
Out of his heaven but he believed I was worth saving
So he came down to earth as a man
Took the sin that condemned me
Paid the price for me so that I could come in
The key to heaven was hung on a nail
On the cross where he suffered
His love prevailed He opened the flood gates
Parted the veil
The key to heaven was hung on a nail
Bethlehem’s manger was a quiet beginning
You knew he was coming but he died on a hill
With so many watching and even history
Says that he lived but it doesn’t explain
Why he endured the shame and died like he did

When I was a curly headed baby
My daddy set me down on his knee
Saying boy you go to school and you learn your letters
Don’t become no dusty miner boy like me.
   And I was born and raised in the mouth of a Hazzard holler
   Where the coal cars rolled and rumbled past my door
   But now they stand in a rusty row of empties
   ‘Cause the L&N don’t stop here anymore.
Now I used to think my daddy was a black man
With script enough to buy the company store
Oh but now he goes to town with empty pockets
And Lord his face is as white as a February snow.
Never thought I’d ever live to love that coal dust
Never thought I’d pray to hear those tipples roar
Oh but God I wish the grass would turn to money
And feel my greenbacks in my pockets once more.
Lastnight I dreamed I went down to the office
To get my payday like I’ve done before
But those kudzu vines they were covering over the doorway
And there were weeds and grass growing right up through the floor.

Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so bitter and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you’ll be contented again
Will you be happy when we are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you’ll only say that you’ll forever be mine
Think of the heartaches the pain and suffering you’ll save
While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
But to this old world I’ll soon bid my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

It’s a lesson too late for the learnin’
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wnk of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand. 
   Are you going away with no word of farewell
   Will there be not a trace left behind?
   I could have loved you better, didn’t mean to be unkind
   You know that was the last thing on my mind. 
 As we walk along my thoughts are tumbling
Round and round, round and round.
Underneath our feet a subway’s rumbling
Underground, underground. 
 You’ve got reasons aplenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don’t go, please don’t go 
 As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Every song in my head dies a-borning
Without you, without you 
 (CH)

In a dreary Yankee prison where a revel soldier lay.
By his side there stood a preacher Ere his soul should pass away.
And he faintly whispered: “Parson” as he clutched him by the hand
Oh Parson, tell me quickly, Will my sould pass through the southland?
Will my soul pass through the Southland, through old Virginia grand
Will i see the hills of Georgia and the green fields of Alabam?
Will i see that little churchhouse, where i pledged my heart and hand
Oh Parson, tell me quickly, will my soul pass thorugh the Southland?
Was for loving dear old Dixie, in this dreary cell I lie
Was for loving dear old Dixie, in this northern state i die.
Will you see my littl daughter, wil you make her understand
Oh Parson, tell my quickly, will my soul pass through the Southland?
Then the Rebel soldier died.

Is there any mail for me was the question that he asked
Of the postman at the closing of the day
But he turned away and cried while the tears stood in his eyes
As he drooped his head and slowly walked away
Was it from a gray haired Mother or a Sister or a Brother
He waited all these many years in vain
Of’t from early morning light he would wait till dark of night
For a letter but alas it never came
As he waited all these years joy mingled with his tears
His poor soul had fleeted out with the time
In his hand he held a note and those simple words he wrote
If your letter comes just place it by my side

Often times in my memories I wandered again
To the little old church by the road
I can see the dear people and hear them so plain
Singing songs of that blessed abode
I can hear my dear mother as she fervently prayed
Blessed Jesus help me carry my load
she was never downhearted and never dismayed
In the little old church by the road
There my mother was praying and the preacher was saying
Sinner come and repent your sins
There the [evil was routed?] and  the sisters were singing
And brethren saying amen
It was there I met Jesus and gave Him my life
It was there He took the weight off my load
And He freely removed all my sorrow and strife
In the little old church by the road
I remember the preacHer so gentle and brave
As He told how the Father above
Gave His only son Jesus all the lost ones to save
Such wonderful wonderful love
I will always remember how He spoke when He said
Come to Jesus He will lighten your load
And so often He told of the life giving bread
In the little old church by the road
I can never forget all those lovely old songs
That the people so joyfully sang
How they told the Lord message to the people gone wrong
And the echos so joyfully rang
I will always remember when I truly believed
Jesus freely took the weight off my load
And the joy of salvation I truly recieved
In the little old church by the road

Way down in a lone green valley
Down where the roses bloom and fade
There was a jealous lover
In love with a beautiful maid
One night the moon shone brightly
The stars were shining too
And to this maiden’s cottage
The jealous lover drew
Come love and we will wander
Where the woods are gay
While strolling we will ponder
Upon our wedding day
So on and on they wandered
The night bird sang above
The jealous lover grew angry
With the beautiful girl he loved
Down on her knees before him
She pleaded for her life
But deep into her bossom
He plunged the fatal knife
Oh Willie won’t you tell me
Why have you taken my life
You know I’ve always loved you
And wanted to be your wife
I never have deceived you
But with my dying breath
I will forgive you Willie
And close my eyes in death

   I walked one evening in the moonlight
I walked one evening in the moonlight
Underneath that Summer sky
I heard a voice so soft and tender
A neighbor girl sat by my side
   I’ve loved you darlin’ for so long now
   I’ve watched and waited all these years
   They say tomorrow you’ll be married
   How can I face these lonely years
So long ago I still remember
The words she said I can’t forget
I told her that I loved another
She bowed her head and slowly left
   They buried her down in the churchyard
   At last her lonely heart is free
   The one I loved soon met another
   The lonely years belong to me
I walked again out in the moonlight
Underneath that Summer sky
I heard no voice so soft and tender
There was no one by my side

The longer you wait to leave me
The longer I’ll hurt when you’re gone
And the longer it takes you to break my heart
The longer the pain lingers on
How long will you prolong my misery
Wish I could leave on my own
Cause the longer you wait to leave me
The longer I’ll hurt when you’re gone
We both knew that you never loved me
I lied to myself from the start
And we both knew that some day you’d leave me
And to know just tears me apart

What an awful day when the judgement comes
And the sinners hear their eternal doom
At the sad decree they’ll depart for aye
Into endless woe and gloom yes woe and gloom
    I’m paying now the penalty
    The unredeemed must ever pay
    Though for help I cry it’s now in vain
    For alas I’m doomed for aye
If I could recall all the years now gone
For my Savior’s cause I would spend each one
But they never again can to me return
And the task is left is left undone (it’s left undone)
Oh I realize but alas too late
What a dark mistake all my life has been
I refused his love with a nefarious heart
And I must pay the price of sin

You have heard of little Moses in the bulrush
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing
There are many, many others through the Bible
I should like to meet them all I do declare
By and by the Lord will surely let us meet them
At that meeting in the air
There is going to be a meeting in the air
In the sweet sweet bye and bye
I am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky
Such singing you will hear—never heard by mortal ear
‘Twill be glorious I do declare
And God’s own son will be the leading one
At the meeting in the air
Many things there will be missing in that meeting
For the mourner’s bench will have no place at all
There will never be a sermon preached to sinners
For the sinners had refused to heed the call
There will be no mourning over wayward loved ones
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that meeting in the air
There the doubters will be missing altogether
All the skeptics will be absent on that day
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us
And the Achans will be busy far away
There the saints will have His seal upon their foreheads
Dressed in raiment none but ransomed ones can wear
All who have the wedding garment will be present
At that meeting in the air

Come with me to the old church yard
I know its path so well
Let’s all sit down under the pines
There’s where my loved ones dwell
Don’t weep for them they’re troubles are over
Although sometimes it’s hard
They’re asleep in the Savior’s care
At rest in the old church yard
When I’m laid to rest beneath the trees
From sorrow then retire
I’ll rest in hope of that bright morn
I’ll awake in the old church yard
Don’t weep for me I’m longing to go
The rest is my reward
I’ll arise with the ones I love
Arise in the old church yard
Come with me to the old church yard
I know its path so well
Let’s all kneel down and have a prayer
For there soon I will dwell

Let me tell you a tale about a spry old man
Guess he’s as old as the hills
He’s the favorite fiddler for miles and miles around
And plays for all the good quadrilles
Every Saturday night all the folks stop in and tune
The whole town is ready to go
While the fellers chose their partners and the caller taps the jug
And the old man puts the rosen to the bow
You could hear Uncle Ben yellin’ do-si-do
Swing that gal in the calico

To night my heart is lonely for the folks back home
Where I left my mother and daddy all alone
There’s been a lot of changes since I been around
I’d like to wander back to the old home town
   You’ll never miss the home folks until you’ve gone away
   Then you’ll need a friend to help you every day
   Then you’ll call on mother but she won’t be around
   I’d like to wander back to the old home town
I’ve searched this whole world over since I’ve been around
I’ve never found a place just like the old home town
If I could live life over I’d never roam around
I’d like to wander back to the old home day

There’s an old old house that once was a mansion
On a hill overlookin’ the own
Where time’s left a wreck where once was a beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down
When the leaves begin to fall in the autumn
And the rain starts to drip from the trees
There’s an old old man who walks in the garden
And his head is bowed in memory.
They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
And they planned to be married in the fall
But her love withered in the last days of summer
And the house stands empty after all.

Listen poor sinner you’re drifting away
From the dear Saviour who’s pleading today
What will you do when the Saviour comes nigh
When the pale horse and his rider go by
The time now ain’t long when the Saviour will come
Then you’ll be judged for the deeds you have done
On that judgment day you’ll weep and you’ll cry
When the pale horse and his rider go by
Soften your heart and turn from all sin
Jesus is waiting to welcome you in
There’s coming a time you’ll wish He was nigh
When the pale horse and his rider go by
Won’t you redeem you poor wicked soul
You can’t pay your way with silver and gold
If you’re not saved you’ll be lost in the night
When the pale horse and his rider go by

Way back in the hills when a boy I once wandered
Buried deep in the grave lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth a jewel for heaven
More pricious than diamonds more precious than gold
A jewel here on earth a jewel in heaven
She’ll brighten the kingdom around God’s Great Throne
May the angels have peace God bless her in heaven
They’ve broken my heart and they’ve left me to roam
When a girl of sixteen we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to heraven one night
This world has its wealth it’s trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can’t hold the soul of one precious jewel
She is resting in peace with the heavenly fold

I feel tears wellin’ up from down deep inside like my heart’s got a big break
And the stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake
You might think that I’m taking it hard since you broke me off with a call
You might wager that I’ll hide in sorrowand I might break right down and ball
Now the race is on and here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartache’s going to the inside my tears are holding back trying not to fall
My heart’s out of the running true love’s scratched for another’s sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache and the winner loses all
One day I ventured in love never once suspecting what the final results would be
Now I live in fear of waking up each morning and finding that you’re gone from me
There’s an achin’ pain in my heart for the name of the one that I hated to face
Somebody else came out to win her and I came out in second place

The path is narrow all the way
But yet I hear my Savior say
Come with me your soul I’ll bless
In that home above I’ll give you rest
Oh the shining path leads up to Heaven
But you must travel it all alone
And to those who walk the shining pathway
Oh the gates will open when you reach that home
I’m in that shining path at last
Oh I can see my Savior’s face
Oh I’ve been saved by Him today
By His ever loving grace
The path is awful hard to trod
But you must put your trust in God
Your path will brighten all the way
In that fair home we’ll meet some day

The city now is sleeping its coast has slowed down
The streets are all deserted they’ve almost lost their sound
I’ve walked the lonely sidewalk my heart way down deep
But the only sound that I hear is the shuffle of my feet
I stare into a window my mind is miles away
Your face is everywhere I go I can’t live on this way
A red light slows my progress then I cress the street
But the only sound that I hear is the shuffle of my feet
I came up to a small café and entered into the gloom
I remember how many times we sat together in this room
I couldn’t stand it any longer I stumbled blindly into the street
Tears came down but the only sound was the shuffle of my feet

I’m going away to leave you love
I’m going away for a while
But I’ll return to see you sometime
If I go ten thousand miles
   The storms are on the ocean
   The heavens may cease to be
   This world may lose it’s motion love
   If I prove false to thee
Oh who will dress your pretty little feet
And who will glove your hand
Oh who will kiss your rosy red cheeks
When I’m in a foreign land
Papa will dress my pretty little feet
And Mama will glove my hand
You may kiss my rosy red cheeks
When you return again
Have you seen those mournful doves
Flying from pine to pine
A-mournin’ for their own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
I’ll never go back on the ocean love
I’ll never go back on the sea
I’ll never go back on my blue-eyed girl
‘Til she goes back on me

Was in the spring we met each other
And by chance a seed was sown
Now it’s five years we’ve been together
And our love how big it’s grown 
You’re the one who wears my ring
These hardtimes don’t mean a thing
I may be poor but I’m a king
You are the sweetest song I sing 
Well, no one know the love we have dear
How two hearts can beat as one
Your smilin’ eyes, way of kissin’
Lovin’ touch when the day is done 
Some people plan for the future
They build a house and save their pay
They need a sign to go on livin’
But I know a better way.

The testing times is just ahead
For the children of the king
Just press along and do not dread
But pray and shout and sing
The time of sorrow it will come
When the beasts shall arise
And sit as God upon his throne
To deceive the blinded eyes
And what that beast may mean to me
No moral can tell
But if we do not take his mark
We can not buy or sell
Our Children they may cry for Him
And some of us may die
But praise the Lord I’m trusting one
That rules the range on high
His children He will not forsake
And when He hears His own
Crying out in agony
The son will leave his throne
His angels He will bring with Him
And send them east and west
And north and south to gather in
The ones that stood the test
Oh won’t you come and go with me
The transportation’s free
Christ Jesus paid the debt for all
On dark Mount Calvary

‘Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin
But he held it up with a smile.
What am I bidden, good folks, he cried
Who will start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar – then Two! Only two?
Two dollars, and who’ll make it three?
Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
Going for three – But no
From the room far back a gray haired man
Came forward and picked up the bow;
Then wiping the dust from the old violin
And tightening the loose strings
He played a melody pure and sweet
As sweet as a caroling angel sings.
The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low
Said What am I bidden for the old violin?
And he held it up with the bow.
A thousand dollars, and who’ll make it two?
Two thousand! And who’ll make it three?
Three thousand once; three thousand, twice;
And going, and gone! said he.
The people cheered and some of them cried
We do not understand What changed its worth?
Swift came the reply:
The touch of the master’s hand.
And many a man with life out of tune
And battered and scattered with sin
Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd
Much like the old violin. 
A “mess of pottage a glass of wine;
A game – and he travels on.
He’s “going” once and ” going” twice
He’s “going” and “almost gone.” 
But the Master comes and the foolish crowd
Never can quite understand
The worth of a soul and the change that’s wrought
By the touch of the Master’s hand.

COME ALONG MY DEAR THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR
WE’LL HAVE TO WALK DOWN WHERE THE FIELD IS OVERGROWN
CONSUMPTION CLAIMED HIS LIFE AND WE DARE NOT MISS THE SIGHT
OF THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMMIE ROGERS HOME
WE’VE HAD SOME HARD TIMES THESE PAST FEW YEARS
LOST THE FARM ALMOST LOST OUR SPIRITS TOO
BUT IT’S THE STRANGEST THING WHEN WE HEARD THAT MAN SING
OH WE KNEW SOMEHOW WE’D MAKE IT THROUGH
   I CAN HEAR THE WHISTLE BLOW THAT OL’ TRAIN IS GOING SLOW
   SOUNDS LIKE IT’S CRYING FOR THE SINGING BRAKEMAN TOO
   BACK TO THE SUNNY SOUTH HE’LL GO AND HE’LL NEVER ROAM NO MORE
   HERE COMES THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMMIE ROGERS HOME
COME HOME MY LITTLE SON AND LET ME HOLD YOU UP
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU ARE GROWN
HOW YOUR MAMA AND YOUR DAD WERE SO PROUD AND SO SAD
WATCHING THE TRAIN CARRYING JIMMIE ROGERS HOME

Where was you when the train left town
I’s standing on the corner with my head hung down
If I had my gun I’d let the hammer down
Lord I’d shoot that rounder took my girl from town
   Hey that train that carried my girl from town
   Hey hey hey hey
I wish to the Lord that the train would wreck
Kill that engineer and break the fireman’s neck
There goes the train that carried my girl from town
If I know’d her number boy I’d flag her down
Rations on the table and the coffee’s getting cold
Some dirty rounder stole my jelly roll
Hello Central give me 6 – 0 – 9
I wanta talk to that woman of mine
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Can you show me the woman that a man can trust
There goes my girl somebody bring her back
Cause she got her hand in my money sack

There’s an old broken lock on the old cabin door
The cracks and the holes in your cabin floor
It’s a tumbled down shack how I long to go back
And dwell in that shack evermore
   Peace peace the valley of peace
   Where no sorrows are known
   Like a heaven yes heaven to me it seems
   Peace the valley my home
Though an old broken window
the light brightly shines
It twinkles and shines through the honeysuckle vines
By the old rustic well is my sweet little Nell
And for me I know how she pines
In the parlor a fire is burning so bright
The old rocking chair is empty tonight
That tumbled down shack is a palace to me
And that’s where I’m longing to be
* Refrain

I thought I heard the voice of my darling
I looked but there was no one else around
Just when I knew her memory would haunt me
Just as long as I stay in this lonesome town
As I go walking down this lonely street
Thinking of a love that used to be
The one I love is gone and I’m so lonely
Then I thought I heard my baby speak to me
Is seems so long now since she went away
Although it was only yesterday
I see her face each time I try to sleep
And I hear her voice on every lonely street

   Oh the waves on the sea how they roll
   And the chilly winds how they do blow
   My own true love got drownded in the deep
   And the ship never got to the shore.
I left my darling grievin’
I left my darling grievin’
I left my darling grievin’ at the deep
And I never expect to see her anymore.
The first on the deck was the captain of the ship
A rough looking fellow was he
Said I care no more for my wife and my child
Than I do for the fish in the sea.
One cold night as I lay on my bed
I fell so fast asleep
And thoughts of my true love come runnin’ through my head
And poor sailors that sail on the deep.
Oh the moon shines so bright and the stars give us light
And my mother is waiting for me
She may look she may weep she may look to the deep
She may look to the bottom of the sea.
Then three times around turned the gallant old ship
Yes three times around turned she
And as she turned (the) third time around
She sank to the bottom of the sea.

There is a time for love and laughter
The days will pass like summer storms
The winter wind will follow after
But there is love and love is warm
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new the world is free
There is a time when leaves are fallin’
The woods are gray the paths are old
The snow will come when geese are callin’
You need a fire against the cold
So do your roaming in the springtime
And you’ll find your love in the summer sun
The frost will come and bring the harvest
And you can sleep when day is done

We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone thru
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do
She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home
As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she’d lay neath the ground
The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do
When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that’s the reason
That there was nothing we could do

There’ll be joy joy joy up in my father’s house
Up in my father’s house up in my father’s house
There’ll be joy joy joy up in my father’s house
Where there’s peace sweet peace
We’ll be happy there up in my fathers house
Up in my father’s house up in my father’s house
We’ll be happy there up in my fathers house
Where there’s peace sweet peace
Don’t you want to go up there to my father’s house
There’ll be no drunkards there up in my father’s house
We’ll all be as one up in my father’s house

There will be no more sorrow on that heavenly shore
There’ll be no wolfs a howlin near the old cabin door
We will all be quite wealthy and there’ll be no more poor
When we all get together on that heavenly shore
   There’ll be no distinction there (over there)
   There’ll be no distinction there
   For the lord am just and the lord am right
   And we’ll all be white in the heavenly light
   There’ll be no distinction there
In the same kind of raiment’s in the same kind of pews
We will all sit together in the same kind of shoes
The white folks and the colored the gentile and the Jews
They will all be so happy that he doesn’t refuse
They tell me up in heaven we will all be as one
And we’ll all sing together when the life’s crown is won
Our fathers and our mothers and sisters will be there
For they tell me up in heaven no distinction there

There’s another baby waiting for me down the line
She has got just what it takes and I have got the time
And you have been untrue my darling to the tie that binds
So there’s another baby waiting for me down the line
I have stayed awake and wondered what I’m gonna do
While you went out honky tonkin’ coming home at two
But tonight I’m all dressed up and feeling Oh so fine
For there’s another baby waiting for me down the line
I may not be at home my darling for a day or more
I’ll give you just a little taste of walking the floor
You won’t need me no longer since I’ve found out you’re that kind
For there’s another baby waiting for me down the line

Well, the cows gone dry, the hens won’t lay, no place I can borrow
I give the landlord all the news and the rent comes due tomorrow
There’s lots of money in the bank they say that’s where they keep it
Not only wouldn’t they loan me some they wouldn’t let me see it
   So pick away on the old banjo, keep that guitar strumming
   Put more water in the soup there’s better times a coming
Well Mary Lou could pull a plow if only I would let her
She’s twice as strong as any ox but looks a little better
I didn’t kiss that Mary Lou but once and then I had to leave her
She made my collar get too high and start the burning fever
My rooster used to chase the hens he just kept a getting thinner
It’s afraid he’d run himself to death so I brought him in for dinner
Yes (the) cotton crops are pretty poor the weeds are really growing
I need a woman pretty bad to help me with the hoeing

Sadly I’m thinking tonight
Thinking of the sweet bye and bye
Memories of childhood so bright
Come back like a dream with a sigh
I’ve been thinking of friends and of home
In that cottage far over the sea
No matter wherever I roam
There’s no one like mother to me
   There’s no one like mother to me
   No matter how poor she may be
   I’ll go back to that home o’er the sea
   There’s no one like mother to me
When I left that old home o’er the sea
I kissed them goodbye at the gate
Somebody whispered to me
A loving voice asked me to wait
Her blessing she gave with a smile
And tears on her cheeks I could see
How often that sweet face I’ve missed
There’s no one like mother to me

All the people today they are going far away
To the mountains the lakes or the sea
There’s a little plot out west
That I always love the best
And there’s someone awaiting there for me
   She’ll be happy she’ll be free
   When she wanders alone with me
   She’ll be knitting white lace
   When I meet her at the gate
   And there’s someone awaiting for me
There are birds in every tree
And they sing among the leaves
But there’s none so happy as me
I am going out west
And there I’ll do my best
To build a little home for you and me
O the birds that fly above
Singing their songs of love
O’er the meadows the valleys so deep
Their voices so sweet
That they sing me to sleep
For I know my darling will not weep

My baby don’t want me she don’t need me
Found herself someone new
Left me alone sittin at home
With nothin’ in the world to do
My stomach’s churnin’ my eyes are burnin’
My hair is turnin’ gray
Troubled deep can’t get no sleep
Since she went away
    These blues they’ve got me
    Tears rollin down my face
    That woman she left me
    Cryin’ all over the place
I wrote a letter to try to get her
To give me just one more try
I wrote it plain I signed my name
And I never got no reply
Now I’m sittin’ at the banks of the riverbed
Listenin’ to the crickets sing
There’s a moon above just made for love
And I can’t do a thing

Go down yonder Moses down in the land of Egypt
Tell that old Pharoah to set my children free
Moses did obey
He set his children free
Go down to the river God told Lazarus
Dip in yourself in Jordan wash your spots away
Lazarus did obey
His spots were washed away
Take your son and burn him God told Abraham
Build yourself an altar God told Abraham
Abraham did obey an
And God gave him a lamb
Take your horn and blow it God told Joshua
The walls of Jericho then fell God then had his way
Joshua did obey
And God then had his way

   These old blues they got me down
   Since my sweet thing she ain’t around
   I’m so blue blue as I can be
   Just as blue as the deep blue sea
Got up this morning I was feeling blue
Couldn’t sleep last night, just thinking of you
Tossed and turned tears in my eyes
Wondering why you said goodbye
Now she’s gone what can I do
It’s too late to start anew
For true love is hard to find
It’s too late to turn back the time

There’s a store by the road in the country
Among the hills where the evergreens grow
In that store by the road there’s a woman
Who is different from others I know
Now her irony-gray hair’s turned to silver
And her kind eyes are ever soft and blue
Always she has a kind word for others
And a smile ever waiting for you
She’s adored for her sunny disposition
By the women, the children and men
In all the neighboring hills they call her Mother
For she’s really a mother dear to them
She is cheerful like the birds in the cedars
She is modest like the songs that they sing
In the hills nearby they call her Mother
For she’s really a mother true to them
When the clouds hang low on the mountain
And the pines are bent low by the snow
Neighbors go to that store by the roadside
It’s a place that they all love to go
Some go there to play cards at the table
Some just sit by the warm, cheering fire
And dear Mother with kind disposition
Finds a way to make all happy there
She’s adored for her sunny disposition
By the women, the children and the men
In all the neighboring hills they call her Mother
For she’s really a mother dear to them

Look up, look down this lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry
For we often lose some things in life
That makes us wonder why
Oh the fairest love I ever had
Now sleeps beneath the clay
I live in hopes and dreams of her
That we’ll meet again someday
I often sit and wonder why
Life has to be this way
But after all is said and done
I’m sure God has his say
I’d like to be a small part of life
With some few things to achieve
Just to know I’ve been a fruitless cause
Would give my poor heart grief
Now when they lower my casket down
In some lonesome grave to rest
And you take your last look at my face
You can say I done my best

   Is it true that I’ve lost you
   Am I not the only one
   After all this pain and sorrow
   Darling think of what you’ve done
Heart to heart dear how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Loving you has been my life, dear
I can’t believe we’re really through
I’ll go back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the sky
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I die

How often I think of the old days
I remember well a love we once knew
We’ve parted now and wandered from each other
But I somehow can’t help wonderin’ about you 
   Are you alone with a memory
   Haunted by the dreams of the past
   Just waiting for someone to tell you
   You’re playing a game that won’t last 
Last night I was dreamin’ about you
I thought you were back here with me
I prayed that you’d stay here forever
But I soon realized it couldn’t be 
Someday when your life here has finished
We’ll meet on that highway up there
We’ll stroll hand in hand there forever
In that land where our love will bloom again

Now as I sigh the hours away
I think of love of yesterday
Now I know she’s gone away
She’s in heaven so they say
Will the angels tell her for me
That my love will never die
Someday I’ll walk along beside her
On that golden way up there
Now all my life I lived so gaily
Until she had to go away
Then she left me oh so lonely
She lies at rest beneath the clay
Each night I think about you dear
I wonder if you’ll know me there
When I meet you up in heaven
We’ll have life eternal there

I can see the sun as it’s sinking
Through the pines on the old mountainside
I can hear my mother a callin
As I sit here alone tonight
    I can see the smoke from the chimney
    I can see the old trail toward home
    As I sit here alone in the city
    I think of the folks there back home
What makes us all want to wonder
Why do we all want to roam
Nobody knows how my heart aches
For my mom and dad back at home
    I’m leaving at sunrise tomorrow
    I can’t wait to see the old home
    For I know they’re waiting by the fireside
    For one of the kids to return
    I can see the smoke from the chimney
    I can see the old trail toward home
    As I sit here alone in the city
    I think of the folks there back home

Now If you think you might have hurt me
When you said good-bye that day
And if you think I might have cried for you
After beggin’ you to stay
    (need you) If you think I might still care for you
   (long for you each) And miss you every lonely night
   If this is really what you’re thinking
   Then you sure are thinking right
It doesn’t matter what they tell me
My love for you will never die
I need you now and will forever
I love you so I could die
If you think I might still miss you
In everything I try to do
And if you think I might still want you
After all you’ve put me through

Oh you told me once dear that you loved me
That we never no never could part
But the link in the chain has been broken
And I’m left with a sad and aching heart
   Oh I’m thinking tonight of my blue eyes
   Who is sailing far over the sea
   Oh I’m thinking tonight of her only
   And I wonder if she ever thinks of me
It wouldn’ve been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world ever met
For the pleasure we’ve both seen together
I am sure we will never forget
Now you may have friends on the ocean
And you may have some over the sea
But you’ll travel this whole wide world over
And you’ll never find a faithful friend like me
Like the birds that go out in the spring time
Just to wander for pleasure alone
While the sun shine is smiling upon them
But someday they return to their home
When the pleasures of life cease to call you
And you’re done with your wine and your song
Then come back to your home in the mountains
To the girl who’s been waiting so long

I sawed the timber for the cabin floor
I built a plank fence out of locust board
I worked the corn rows in the early morn
And raised a family on a poor man’s farm 
Thirty two acres of bottom land
Bought and paid for by my own hand
Worth a fortune to a working man
Thirty two acres of bottom land 
I planted a peach tree, now the leaves are dying
I watered a grapevine; it’s no longer mine
The county’s taken everything I own
Cause it’s on the right way for a four lane road

I find many people who can’t understand
Why I am so happy and free
I’ve crossed over Jordan to Canaan’s fair land
And this is like heaven to me
   Oh this is like heaven to me
   Yes this is like heaven to me
   I’ve crossed over Jordan to Canaan’s fair land
   And this is like heaven to me
I’ve heard the sweet music the heavenly chorus
From glory land over the sea
The soul thrilling message from Jesus my lord
And this is like heaven to me
I’m looking for Jesus in glory to come
From glory land over the sea
A cloud of bright angels to carry me home
And that will be heaven to me

In a church on a mountain far far away
We vowed we’d never part
You kept your promise to honor and obey
But then I broke your heart
   If you could see this misery
   I know that you’d come home to me
   There’s no one else I’d rather have
   To have your love I’d be so proud to say
   This is the girl I love
What can I do dear, what can I say
To make you change your mind
If I could only have another chance
I’d never leave you behind

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They’re like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they’re gone
They’ll tell to you some loving story
And they’ll make you think that they love you well
And away they’ll go and court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell
I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I’d write a letter to my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
And when he’d ask, I would deny
Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it’s new
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew

My heart is breaking and there’s tears in my eyes
The heartaches you caused me has wrecked my young life
The love that you promised to me was untrue
All I have is a memory I can’t forget about you
This lonesome old feeling keeps hanging around me
It reminds me of you and the love that we knew
I’ll sit here alone there’s no one beside me
With no love of my own now that you’re gone
The nights are so lonely and you’re still on my mind
I can’t loose this memory of you now I find
So I’ll go on hurting and thinking of you
This lonesome old feeling keeps making me blue

I awoke this morning from a lovely dream
And looked about this lonely room of mine
Somewhere in the distance to me it seemed
Church bells were ringing this morning at nine
   Bitter tears I’m shedding all because of you
   I’m like a lonely prisoner serving his time
   Thinking of the day the days when love was true
   But you’ll wed another this morning at nine
My poor broken heart it started to cry
As I realized you never could be mine
Just then I remembered what day it really was
That you wed another this morning at nine

This old song won’t take long
Just to tell what went wrong
I had to leave my old home
And now I’m walking all alone
You can see me through your eyes
I’m the one that’s tellin’ lies
You can play your little games
But you cannot change my name
So I’ll go where I know
My seeds will sow
If I walk this lonesome road
To that valley of despair
Then I know when I get out
Darkness cannot find me there
And the time that it takes
And the mark that it makes
Will change me just the same
But they cannot change my name
So I’ll go where I know
My seeds will sow

I wait for you dear all night long
It seems you never do get home
I fall asleep at the break of day
Just to drive these awful blues away
   Wake up sweetheart the night has passed
   You slept your troubles all away
   Get ready now to love again
   This weary heart you stole away
I heard you crying in your sleep
You said you found somebody new
So I’ll live on and just pretend
I could never love no one but you
How can you treat me like you do
You know I’ve never done you wrong
My heart will always worship you
But still each night I’m left alone

This world is not my home I’m just-a-passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
Angels beckon me to heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore
Oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven’s not my home oh Lord what will I do
Angels beckon me to heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore
There all expecting me that’s one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago
He will take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore
Over in glory land there’ll be no dying there
The saints all shouting victory and singing everywhere
I hear the voice of them that’s gone on before
And I can’t feel at home in this world anymore

One evening as the sun was low
Brown eyes whispered I must go
Not one moment would he wait
He kissed my cheek and left the gate
    Those brown eyes I love so well
    Those brown eyes I long to see
    Now I sigh for those brown eyes
    Stranger they have grown to me
One day we met upon the street
I bowed me head but did not speak
Another one was by his side
I thought one day would be his bride
Just a year ago today
They lay my own brown eyes away
As I view that mound of clay
Memories in my heart do sway

In dreams of you my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you’re not there and I’m so lonely
Without your love I’ll go insane 
   Those memories of you still haunt me
   Every night when I lay down
   I’ll always love you little darling
   Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you’re there with me
Your kiss I feel your face I see
It’s not your lips now that drive me crazy
It’s just your haunting memory

On the day that I first saw you
Those two blue eyes they seemed to say
I’ll always be there if you need me
But with another they went away
    You told me that your love was true
    Just like a fool I trusted you
    Those two blue eyes I love so well
    What they done to me no one can tell
Oh you gave me back my picture
And you gave me back my ring
You gave your sweet love to another
Oh Lord you’re driving me insane

 Three men on a mountain up on Calvary
And the man in the middle was Jesus
He died for you and me
Well the man on the left was a sinner tied to a cross he bled
He could have been forgiven but he mocked the Lord instead
You say you are the Son of God they’ve nailed you to a tree
Come down come down and save us if God your Father be
Well the man on the right was a sinner but he was sorry for his sins
He begged the Lord’s forgiveness and Jesus said to him
Fear not fear not this earthly death before this day is o’er
You’ll be with me in paradise on Heaven’s golden shore

Throw down your earthly crown
Never mind how it sparkles and glows
The crown best worn is made of thorns
And from every thorn blooms a rose
From every thorn blooms a rose
Think not of earthly kings
Though they have precious stones and jewels
The one true king had none of these things
He had just a carpenter’s tools
He had just a carpenter’s tools
Think not of earthly queens
Though they might have wealth untold
Much more a queen was Mary Magdalene
She had a wealth in her soul
She had a wealth in her soul
Think not of palaces fair
And churches laden with gold
It was there in the market square
That all the lessons were told
All the lessons were told
Think not of the armies of man
The battles won and lost
THe cowardly man has blood on his hands
The brave man hangs from the cross
The brave man hangs from the cross
Throw down your earthly crown
Never mind how it sparkles and glows
The crown best worn is made of thorns
And from every thorn blooms a rose
From every thorn blooms a rose

In a little country village
I met a man and he was blind
As I helped him cross the highway
I cried thy burdens are greater than mine
   I can see the light of day
   And I need not feel my way
   Yes thy burdens
Saw a lad well on his travels
Trying hard to play the game
Though his leg was very crippled
And he could not speak his name
Still he smiled in understanding
Though life to him had been unkind
As I watched I thought in sorrow
Son thy burdens
   I can speak my name aloud
   Make my way among the crowd
   Yes thy burdens
Just by chance I passed a graveyard
Saw a young man kneeling there
In his hand there were some roses
On his lips there was a prayer
On a stone these words were written
My soul is God’s my memory thine
As I watched I thought in sorrow
Friends thy burdens
   I’m just a drifter all alone
   I got no friends I got no home
   Yes thy burdens …

   Til the end of the world rolls ’round I’ll keep on loving you
   As long as the sun goes up and comes down
   And the big blue sky goes down to the ground
   As long as the world goes round and round I’ll keep on loving you
I tried to sail the sea of life I rowed my boat alone
Your love meant nothing to me dear my heart was made of stone
To a harbor filled with loneliness my little boat was moored
And on the day I first met you I fell right overboard
Whenever you’re around me dear my heart just won’t stand still
And when it comes to kissing you I’ll never get my fill
They said I’d never settle down that I would always roam
That I could never be the type for a loving wife and home
So now I know the way I felt was only selfish pride
I thought my heart was fireproof but you burned your way inside
So tell me what I’ve got to do and tell me how it stands
The cards are on the table dear my life is in your hands

Til you love me again til you learn what you’re missing
I’m not waiting in line but I’m saving my kissin’
I’m just letting you know I don’t want to let go
My hearts set on one thing til you love me again
Days don’t go by I don’t think of
Words of love you used to say
You lit a fire that won’t but out
There in your promise I’ll stay
Til you love again I won’t say that it’s over
You can know other girls
but it won’t bring you closer
To the place that you’ve been & you won’t find another
My hearts set on one thing til you love me again
I was a fool & I fell in
Now I must wait patiently
You’ll find each road that you’re taking
Is going to lead back to me

Times are getting hard boys
If times don’t get much better boy’s going to leave this earth
Take my true love by the hand lead her through the town
Say goodby to everyone goodby Sally Brown
Had a crop about a year ago it withered to the ground
I tried to get some money but the banker turned me down
Take my Bible from the shelf my shotgun from the wall
Take old Sal and hitch her up the wagon for to haul
Put everything on the wagon boys so nothing can tumble down
Sal can pull and we can push we’re bound to leave this town
I’m going to California where everything is green
I’m going to have the nicest farm that you have ever seen

He was just a little farm lad so busy at play
In his little playhouse down by the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate
Then he saw his Daddy watching too
As the man swiftly walked to the cottage door
He knew they were strangers that come from the town
Men he had never seen before
They soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no, he cried, dear God don’t let it be
They can’t take my sweetheart away
I know Dad that you don’t understand
How a heart so young could conceive a plan
I’m only seven now but it’s just like you say
Daddy someday I’ll be a man
The man who owns the farm where your playmate now lives
He told me it has to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done
And now they are moving away
Let us buy the farm so they can stay
Give them all my toys that dear Santa gave
And give him the pennies in my little bank
Pennies that my darling helped me save

Through thick and thin gonna sink or swim
To prove my love to you
And if I have to climb a mountain
Well that’s what I’ll do
I’d fight a bull like a matador
Laugh in the face of a dinosaur
I’d do anything you want me to
To prove my love to you
   Yes to prove my love to you
   I’d swim the ocean blue
   Well I’d wrestle a gator box a kangaroo
   Just to prove my love to you
And to say that I don’t have to do these things
To prove my love to you
Just hold you close whisper low
That my love to you
If that’s all there is for your love to win
Well I’ll take you now that I know I’m in
Cause I’d do anything that you want me to
To prove my love to you

Today I started loving you again
Well I’m right back where I’ve really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again 
 What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these two million tears I cry
I should have known the worst was yet to come the crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again

Hang down your head Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster
You know you’re bound to die
You took her on the hillside
As God almighty knows
You took her on the hillside
And there you hid her clothes
You took her by the roadside
Where you begged to be excused
You took her by the roadside
Where there you hid her shoes
You took her on the hillside
To make her your wife
You took her on the hillside
Where there you took her life
Take down my old violin
And play it all you please
At this time tomorrow
It’ll be no use to me
I dug a grave four feet long
I dug it three feet deep
And throwed the cold clay o’er her
And tramped it with my feet
This world and one more than
Where do you reckon I’d be
If it hadn’t been for Grayson
I’d a been in Tennessee

Lost like a grain of sand upon the sands of time
Trusting and believing in a love I thought was mine
Tossed just like a ship by the waves of a storm
To find the way home, but to-morrow I’ll be gone 
   I’ll be gone when your blinded eyes open wide to see
   You’re a loser in this game of love you played so carelessly
    You thought your new love faithful, like a bird it has flown
   And now you’re left alone, and tomorrow I’ll be gone. 
 Gone like the leaves in the fall, to return no more
That is how she left you, like the others before
Hopeless love have I, now it has torn
My heart in little pieces, and tomorrow I’ll be gone.

Come take me by my trembling hand
And hold me close to you
And think of all the days gone by
The day when love was true
   Come go with me to the old depot
   And wave your hand good-bye
   I know I’ve done you wrong sweetheart
   But now it’s too late to cry
Sweetheart of mine, I hate to go
And leave you here all alone
May God protect and keep you
Wherever you may roam

All last night I sat and cried I cried the night before
If that gal don’t come back tonight I’ll cry somemore
   It’s too late to walk the floor It’s too late to cry
   It’s too late to worry About tear drops in my eyes
I done her wrong I know I did I cheated on the sly
She found out and now she’s gone I walk the floor and cry
Now I can’t stand this loneliness four walls and the floor
Please come back darlin’ I can’t stand this any more

Too much Mountain dew
Too much Mountain dew
Dewey left a-drinking
Too much Mountain dew
Now Dewey left this morning
Feeling oh so fine
With a jug in one hand
Drinking on his mind
Now the hottest sun was shining
While Dewey laid in the shade
Drinking from a bottle
Home brew that he made
Now drinking was a weakness
That he couldn’t hide
Had one drink too many
Poor old Dewey died

If life is like a candle bright
Then death must be the wind
You can close your window tight
But it still comes blowing in
So I will climb the highest hill
And watch the risin’ sun
And pray that I won’t feel the chill
‘Til I’m too old to die young
   Let me watch my children grow
   To see what they become
   Lord don’t let the cold winds blow
   Til I’m too old to die young
Well I have had some dear sweet friends
I thought would never die
The only thing that’s left of them
Are these teardrops in my eyes
If I could have one wish today
And know it would be done
Then I would pray everyone could stay
‘Til they’re too old to die young

Here’s the story of two childhood sweethearts
And the love that you shared still untold
How our simple little vows they were broken
And the love that I treasured more than gold
Are you tired of the life that you’re living
Does your mind wander back to the past
Do your think of the love you’ve forsaken
Darling true love is too sweet to last
I remember that night in the moonlight
when you said that you’d found someone new
do you realize the heartaches you caused me
you should know that my love was so true
Alone in sadness I’m traveling
I’m lost on the sea of regret
Wandering back to the place of my childhood
And the one I’ve always loved the best

When my burdens grow heavy (heavy, heavy)
And it seems there’s no way
I kneel by my bedside
And the Lord’s prayer I’ll pray
God lifts me right up (up, up)
And he makes to stand
Because when I’m troubled
I wait for the touch of God’s hand
I once had a vision (vision, vision)
As I knelt to pray
I saw Jesus coming
And the world pass away
And then I was troubled (troubled, troubled)
But he makes me to stand
Because when I’m troubled
I wait for the touch of God’s hand
Thank God for a mother (mother, mother)
Who’s taught me to pray
So I can be ready
On the great judgment day
When problems arise (arise, arise)
That I don’t understand
I kneel down and wait – yes I’ll wait
I’ll wait for the touch of God’s hand

   Darling, you toyed with toy heart
   I think you played the game right from the start
   This toy heart was broken when parting words were spoken
   Darling, you toyed with a toy heart
You played with my poor heart like a toy
That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended I hope this romance’s ended
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart
Now darling my time will come some day
Time alone will heal my broken heart
The clouds will roll away, the sun will shine someday
Darling, you toyed with a toy hear
Now darling you know you’ve done me wrong
Your love for me has passed and gone
I’ll find somebody new, I hope that they’ll be true
Darling you toyed with a toy heart

Come pretty young girls give me your attention
To these few lines I’ve tried to write
About a man who I won’t mention
Who courted of his charming bride
And when her parents came to know him
They tried so hard both day and night
To separate here and her own true lover
Her and her own true hearts delight
She turned her back upon the city
She viewed the fields and meadows round
She came upon a broad river
And in the shade of a tree sat down
Her true love being not far behind
He heard her make a mournful sound
And looking on her lifeless body
As she lay cold upon the ground
He then took out his silver weapon
He pierced it through his tender heart
Sayin let this be a dreadful warning
For all true lovers that have to part

Nestled in the heart of the Tennessee hills
Midst peaceful pines ‘neath the rocks and the rills
There stands my old homestead of long years ago
Brings back sweet memories of the one I loved so
I courted a maiden so sweet and so fair
With pearly blue eyes and with chestnut brown hair
She promised to love and said she’s be mine
But I went away leaving her there behind
I’ll tell you the reason why I left her there
To roam this old world with its sorrow and cares
I saw her one night in the arms of a man
Hugging and kissing as true lovers can
I went to my home with a heart full of woe
Packed my belongings determined to go
For many long years this old world I did roam
With thoughts of my sweetheart my darling my own
While dining one day in a little country town
A stranger came in and he chanced to sit down
While talking of loved ones I happened to find
That his sister was that old sweetheart of mine
Now I am the man who you saw that fateful night
Wrapped in the arms of my sister so tight
She waited so long for the day you’d return
And why you had left her she never did learn
When he heard my story to me then he said
The one that you loved has a long time been dead
She loved you so dearly but you broke her heart
Poor stranger, from her ever more you must part

Train on the island listen to her squeal
Go and tell my true love how happy I do feel
Go and tell my true love how happy I do feel
Train on the island headed for the west
Go and tell my true love the girl I love the best
Go and tell my true love the girl I love the best
The steam from the whistle smoke from the stack
Goin to catch that 5:18 I’m never comin’ back
Goin to catch that 5:18 I’m never comin’ back
Train on the island thought I heard her squeal
Go and tell my true love that I can’t hold the wheel
Go and tell my true love that I can’t hold the wheel
Train on the island moan mighty low
Go and tell my true love as far as I can go
Go and tell my true love as far as I can go
Train on the island headed for the north
Go and tell my true love she don’t know what she’s worth
Go and tell my true love she don’t know what she’s worth

    The train that I ride is going to Harlan
    The train that I ride is going to Harlan
    I’m here today but I’ll be home tomorrow
No more will I roam no more will I wander
No more will I roam no more will I wander
The early morning train will take me down yonder
I’ve been in this town through 10 years of sorrow
I’ve been in this town through 10 years of sorrow
The train that I ride will leave here tomorrow
 

I can see it all to clearly as I am looking back
I was headed down the wrong way on a one way track
There must be a million chances that a fool can take
Well this fool took every one and never hit the brakes
   I’m lying in the rubble cinder smoke and ash
   My hearts still pounding from the impact of the crash
   I can see tomorrow’s headline heartbroken by devotion
   Just another victum of a train wreck of emotion
We were burning like a furnace and she poured on the coal
Drive wheels a churning I new love was gonna roll
Faster and faster I swear we left the ground
When that smoke had cleared she was no where around
Rumors are flying about how our love had failed
When I swear to tear the coldness which let me derail

Oh I was lost in the darkness and I wandered astray
With no one to help me along on my way
Until I heard Jesus calling saying come unto me
And I’m traveling on and on
   Oh Lord I’m traveling on by the help of my Savior
   I can never more stray for Jesus leads the way
   And my heaven lies awaiting at the end of my journey (my journey)
   Oh Lord I’m traveling on and on
Oh I can hear Jesus calling and his voice sounds so sweet
And I knew that the time would come to me that he’d speak
But these trials are over for he bid me come home
Now I’m traveling on and on
Oh the Lord is my savior I will walk with him each day
He will help and protect me to the end of the way
My journey soon will be over and I’ll join a happy band
Now I’m traveling on and on

   I’m traveling down this lonesome road oh how I hate to go
   The wind and storms are raging high and it’s awful cold
   My mind drifts back to you sweetheart and I love you so
   Now you’ve gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I remember dear not long ago you said you’d be my own
I never thought you’d go away and leave me all alone
The kind of love you had for me I find sweetheart grows cold
For now you’ve gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
All I do is roam around and look for you my dear
I know I’ll search ten thousand miles oh how I need you here
You broke my heart you left me here now I’m growing old
Why did you go and leave me here to travel this lonesome road

Trials troubles tribulations
Such as never been before
When the angels pour upon us
Their vows of dread for ever more
    When the fire comes down from Heaven
    And the blood shall fill the sea
    I’ll be carried home by Jesus
    There forever with him be
The beasts with horns will come upon you
One with seven one with ten
They will cry unto the mountain
They’ll pray to die but cannot win
The mark must be upon your forehead
These earthly goods you then can buy
Depart from me I never knew you
You’ll hear my blessed Savior cry
 

Trouble in mind I’m blue
But I won’t be blue always
‘Cause the sun’s gonna shine
On my back door someday
I’m gonna lay down my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two-nineteen
Ease my troubled mind
I’m goin’ down the river
Gonna take my rockin’ chair
And if them blues don’t leave me
I’ll rock right out of here
I’m all alone at midnight
And the lamp is burnin’ low
I’ve never had so much
Trouble in my life

Troublesome waters around me do roll
They’re rockin’ my boat and wreckin’ my soul
Loved ones are driftin’ and livin’ in sin
The treacherous whirlpools are pullin’ them in
When troublesome waters are rollin’ so high
I lift up my voice and to heaven I cry
Lord I am trustin’ give guidance to me
And steady my boat on life’s troubled sea.
Troublesome waters are blacker than night
Hiding from view the harbor light bright
Out on the ocean I seem as a speck
Awful sea monsters are waiting my wreck
   Gently I feel the touch of his hand
   Guiding my boat to that better land
   Leading way to heaven’s bright shore
   Troublesome waters I’m fearing no more
Troublesome waters around me now roll
Rocking my boat and tempting my soul
Loved ones are drifting and living in sin
Treacherous whirlpools are pulling them in
Sin waves are tossing and dashing so high
Over this noise you hear my sad cry
Lord I am trusting show mercy to me
Steady my lifeboat while I am at sea

I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas,
A little place called Hamburger Dan’s
I heard that old jukebox a-playing,
A song ’bout a truck driving man
   Pour me another cup of coffee,
   For it is the best in the land
   I’ll put a nickel in the jukebox,
   And play The Truck Driving Man
The waitress then brought me some coffee
I thanked her and called her back again
I said, “That ol’ song sure does fit me
‘Cause I am a truck driving man
I stepped back on board my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them ol’ truck wheel a-rollin
I’m on my way to San Antone

I hate to see the sun sink low
Just for a cause you ought to know
For it’s true love I can’t forget
All of my sorrows you’ll soon regret
You promised me love that was true
And I’m sorry to say that I believed in you
For its all turned out just like a dream
Left me so sad in the world it seems
There’s dishes to wash and a house to clean
There’s washing to do oh it seems so mean
There’s a million words I can’t explain
Think of this girl before you change your name
They’ll go away and leave you at home
They never care if you’re alone
They seem to forget they’ve got a wife
This story is sad, but it’s a true life

I hate to see the sun sink low
Just for a cause you ought to know
For it’s true love I can’t forget
All of my sorrow you’ll soon regret
You promised me love that was true
And I’m sorry to say that I believed in you
It’s all turned out just like a dream
Left me so sad in the world it seems
There’s dishes to wash and a house to clean
There’s washing to do, oh it seems so mean
There’s a million words I can’t explain
Think of this girl, before you change your name
They’ll go away and leave you at home
They never care if you’re alone
They seem to forget they’ve got a wife
This story is sad, but it’s a true life

The last time I thought about leaving
Was the last time I made her cry
I’ve talked myself out of believing
That true true love never dies
The first time I though of returning
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a-turning
There’s nothing on this earth gonna shut me down.
   If I had one drop of water
   For each and every tear I have cried
   I’d sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
   True true love never dies.
The fires in vain turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesomest night surely passes
That old true true love never dies.

I wish there were some way to tell you I’m sorry
That I didn’t leave you a long time ago
Yea, but many mistakes are a part of the story
And heartache by heartache, I’ve turned you to stone. 
   So call me a traveller, catch me a train
   Want to see Frisco, see the sun shine again
   And if you want true love, but can’t stand to know
    Life here together has turned you to stone. 
 I’ve held youcaptive in a life without sunshine
Yea and I’ve watched the blue in your eyes fade away
All good is gone now, no need to continue
Destroying each other, day after day.

The judge said stand up boy and dry up your tears
You’re sentenced to Nashville for twenty one years
They took him to Nashville to pay for his crime
But twenty one years boys is a mighty long time
A year went by slowly he wished he was dead
In that dirty prison with a floor for a bed
The girl whom he loved most and dreamed of each night
He wrote her this letter babe why don’t you write
I’ve counted the days love I’ve counted the nights
I’ve counted the minutes I’ve counted the lights
I’ve counted the footsteps I’ve counted the stars
I’ve counted a million of the cold prison bars
I’ve counted on you love to give me a break
I guess you forgot babe I’m here for your sake
Yes you know who’s guilty you know it too well
But I’ll rot in this prison before I will tell
Come all you young fellows, with hearts brave and true
Don’t believe any woman you’re beat if you do
Don’t trust any woman no matter what kind
For twenty one years boys is a mighty long time

I been to the doctor he says I’m all right
I know he’s lying, I’m losing my sight
He should have examined the eyes of my mind
20/20 vision and walkin’ ’round blind 
Since she’s gone and left me I feel so alone
I carry a heart that is heavy as stone
I knew that she cheated, I knew all the time
20/20 vision and walkin’ ’round blind 
With my eyes wide open I lay in my bed
If it wasn’t for dying, I wish I was dead
But this is my punishment, death is too kind
20/20 visionJi… 
You just couldn’t know her the way that I do
You say that she’s wicked and maybe it’s true
But one thing I do know, she’s no longer mine
20/20 vision… 
I’ve lost her, I’ve lost her, oh what will I do
I bet you’re not happy if she’s there with you
The eyes of your heart will have trouble like mine
20/20 vision…
20/20 vision

I’ve been to the doctor, he says I’m alright
I know he is lying, I’m losing my sight
He should have examined the eyes of my mind
Twenty-twenty vision and walking round blind
Ever since she’s gone and left me I feel so alone
I carry a heart that is heavy as stone
I knew that she cheated, I knew all the time
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blind
You just couldn’t know her the way that I do
You tell me she’s wicked and maybe it’s true
But one thing I do know she’s no longer mine
Twenty-twenty vision and walking round blind
I’ve lost her I’ve lost her oh what shall I do
I’ll bet you’re not happy as she’s there with you
The eyes of your heart will have trouble like mine
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blind

Twilight is stealing over the sea
Shadows are falling dark on the lee
Born on the night winds voices of yore
Come from that far off shore
Far away beyond the starlit skies
Where the lovelight never never dies
Gleameth a mansion filled with delight
Sweet happy home so bright
Voices of loved ones songs of the past
Still linger round me while life shall last
Lonely I wander sadly I roam
Seeking a far off home
Come in the twilight come come to me
Bringing some message from over the sea
Cheering my pathway while here I roam
Seeking that far off home

I want two arms to hold me when I’m feelin’ blue
I want someone to love me with a love so true
I want two lips to kiss me as they use to do
I want two arms to hold me darlin’ I want you
I want two arms to hold me and never let me go
If you ever loved me my dear I want to know
Cause when I’m sad and lonely that’s when I want you so
I want two arms to hold me when I’m feelin’ low
You use to say you loved me you use to hold me tight
Now you leave me lonely to long for you at night
I want two arms to hold me that held me close before
The arms that use to hold me will reach for me no more
When shadows start to fallin’ and you’re alone and blue
You’ll want two arms to hold you that use to care for you
Just think about me darlin’ and this little song
You’ll want two arms to hold you and you may find me gone

I’m walking the floor with tears in my eyes
I can’t undersand dear why you ever lied
The stars in the skies have tumbled below
Now my heart is breaking it’s beating so low
The moment you walked dear into my heart
What a wonderful meeting for two lonely hearts
You gave me your love to have and to hold
But something has happened you took the wrong road
You said you would love and you would obey
But the Golden Rule’s broken so go on your way
I’ve lost all the faith that I’ve had in you
So go on away dear you could never be true

While you are out beneath the moonlit sky
I sit here and stare at the wall
I think of you sweetheart and days gone by
And I know two more years is all
   Two more years is all and I’ll be free
   And then we can start our lives anew
   I’ve held your memory so close to me
   Two more years and I’ll be free
I’ve been in this old prison for nineteen years
It seems like ninety to me
Only twenty-four months of tears sweetheart
Two more years and I’ll be free

A crowd of young fellas one night at a ball
Were telling of sweethearts they’d had
All seemed hardy except one lad
Who seemed downhearted and sad
Come join us Ned his comrades then said
Surely some girl has loved you
Then raising his head proudly he said
I’m in love with two
   One has hair of silver gray
   The other one is just like gold
   One is young and youthful too
   The other is aged and old
   
   But dearer than life are they both to me
   From neither would I part
   One is my mother God bless her I love her
   The other one is my sweetheart
My sweetheart is a poor working girl
Whom I’m determined to wed
Father says no it will never be so
You must marry an heiress instead
Mother was young she knows how it is
When father met her she was poor
Ned don’t fret she’ll be your wife yet
For he will consent I am sure

Have you ever been to meeting Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Have you ever been to meeting Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Have you ever been to meeting Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
I don’t mind the weather so the wind don’t blow
   Hop up my ladies three in a row
   Hop up my ladies three in a row
   Hop high ladies for the cake’s all dough
   How I get enough time Lord I never know
Will your horse carry double Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Will your horse carry double Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Will your horse carry double Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
I don’t mind the weather so the wind don’t blow
Is your horse a single footer Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Is your horse a single footer Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Is your horse a single footer Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
I don’t mind the weather so the wind don’t blow
Would you rather have a pacer Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Would you rather have a pacer Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
Would you rather have a pacer Uncle Joe Uncle Joe
I don’t mind the weather so the wind don’t blow

Oh the people would come from far away
They’d dance all night till the break of day
When the caller hollered “do-se-do”
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go 
   Late in the evening about sundown
   High on the hill and above the town
   Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
   You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
He played an old piece he called “Soldier’s Joy”
And the one called “The Boston Boy”
The greatest of all was “Jenny Lynn”
To me that’s where the fiddle begins
I’ll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to go

Oh they tell me of a land far beyond the skies
Oh they tell me of a home far away
Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
Oh they tell me of an unclouded day
   Oh the land of cloudless day
   Oh the land of an unclouded sky
   Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
   Oh they tell me of an unclouded day
Oh they tell me of a home where my friends have gone
Oh they tell me that land far away
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom
Shed its fragrance through the unclouded day
Oh they tell me of the King in his beauty there
And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
Where He sits on the throne that is whiter than snow
In that city that is made of gold
Oh they tell me that He smiles on his children there
And His smile drives their sorrows all away
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
In that lovely land of unclouded sky

Oh they tell me of a home far beyond the sky
Oh they tell me of a home far away
Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
Oh they tell me of an uncloudy day
   Oh the land of cloudless days
   Oh the land of an uncloudy sky
   Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
   Oh they tell me of an uncloudy day
Oh they tell me that he smiles on his children there
And his smile drives the sorrows away
Oh they tell me that now clouds ever come again
In that lovely land of uncloudy days

   You’ve got me under your spell again
   Sayin’ those things again
   Makin’ me believe that you’re just mine
   You’ve got me dreamin’ those dreams again
   Thinkin’ those things again
   I’ve got to take you back just one more time.
I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn’t see you if you came around
But I can’t tell my heart what’s right or wrong
And I’ve been so lonely since you’ve been gone.
Well everybody tells me that I’m a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it’s true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do.

   Unfaithful one you’ll have to suffer
   You’re doomed to go through life alone
   For no one else will ever trust you
   They’ll know your heart is made of stone
I still recall our happy years dear
Our love was fresh as flowers of spring
But now you’ve left me for a stranger
You’ve lost the right to wear my ring
So blue was I the day you left me
My heart was sad and lonely too
My place was taken by this stranger
You traded an old love for a new

I’m wanting someone that’s loved and lost
Someone that’s known the thrill and paid the cost
Someone that says they’ll never take a chance
On another broken heart, lies, false romance
   Wanted an unwanted love
   To share all the misery and pain
   Of a heart that’s unwanted and loved
   And unwilling to gamble again
I don’t want to love again I’m sure
Someone whose love is not sincere
I don’t want someone who hasn’t known
How it feels to love and be alone
I know there are others like me
Alone, footloose and fancy free
Yet chained to a love they’ll never claim
And afraid to ever love again

Well you don’t love me anymore my darling
I’m just a used to be to you
Those cold cold kisses that you gave me little darling
Proved to me you found somebody new
   Tomorrow’s just another lonesome day
   And I know you’ll want me far away
   Well you don’t love me anymore my darling
   I’m just a used to be to you
Gone are the good old days that we spent together
And I don’t know if I can stand the pain
Of knowing that you’ll soon be gone forever
And I’ll never know your love again

It was in the time of autumn
The golden leaves lay all around
That we laid our dear old father
Away beneath the cold damp ground
   It seems but a short time ago
   That he was in his fullest bloom
   But death alas has laid him low
   Another victim to the tomb
Many sad farewells were given
Many bitter tears were shed
Our sad hearts all beat with anguish
As he lay on his dying bed
On a savior’s summons he was readied
On his journey home to go
And fearless drew near the dark valleys
Washed in His blood whiter than snow

We were waltzing in the light of the old Virginia moon
As the fiddles played their music so low
I was happy as a king with the girl of my dream
Until she whispered sweetheart I must go
   Oh I’ll never forget the night when we met
   You found me when my heart was low
   Now my heart will always yearn
   ‘Til the day when you return
   And we’ll dance to the Old Virginia Waltz

Oft my thoughts drift back to childhood
To the times when I was free
As I played before the fireside
Round my darling mother’s knee
   There’s a blessed home up yonder
   Where my loved ones wait for me
   I saw mother in a vision
   Kneeling there to pray for me
Then one day our mother left us
Daddy said she’d gone to rest
I remember how she loved me
As she clutched me to her breast
Some sweet day I’ll meet you mother
Your little boy is coming home
To see you as in days of childhood
The one you loved and left alone

    I heard a sweet voice so tenderly calling
    Saying arise be saved evermore
    And I knew it must be the voice of my Savior
    For I had not heard a voice like it before
I remember one night in an old fashioned meeting
I was praying to God to redeem my poor soul
When I heard the sweet voice of my lovin’ Savior
And I started that night to make heaven my home
I’m glad that I heard the voice of my Savior
I know I’m redeemed by his wonderful grace
Someday when he calls I’ll go up to Heaven
And then in that city I’ll look on His face

From the great Atlantic Ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the green ol’ Smoky Mountains to the south lands by the shore
She’s mighty tall and handsome and she’s known quite well by all
She’s the regular combination of the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobos call
You’re traveling through the jungles on the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandy, so the people always say
From New York to St Louis with Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Now here’s to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
And always be remembered through the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over, now the curtains round him fall
We’ll carry him home to victory on the Wabash Cannonball

Here the labour is so hard and the workers are so tired
And our weary hearts are longing for a rest
And we find we’re getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where we’ll enjoy some peace and happiness. 
   But wait a little longer, please, Jesus
   There’s so many still a-wandering out in sin
   Just a little longer, please, Jesus
   Just a few more days tolet our loved ones in. 
We may look into the skies and tearswillfill our eyes
For our weary hearts grow heavy with each day
First we cry oh lord please come, come and take our children home
And then we look around us and we say: 
The family’s scattered here and there, but Lord we love them dear
And maybe we can help them find the way
Well if waiting is the cause well they might not be
Lord that’s the only reason why we say:

chorus:
Wait a minute did I hear you say you’re going far away again
Try to change it I can’t take the lonely nights without your love
Out doin’ the road get the music done and move along
What good does it do play your songs for her and hear her say
(chorus)
You’re rolling along, life’s been good to you but even so
She comes to you late at night’s the time you hear her say
(chorus)
I’m waitin’ for you thirty days and nights without a rest
I gotta hold on twenty-five to go to hear you say hey
(chorus) repeat 3x

   Wait a minute did I hear you say you’re going far away again
   Try to change it I can’t take the lonely nights without your love
Doin’ the road get the music done and move along
What good does it do Play your songs for her and hear her say
You’re rollin’ along life’s been good to you and even so
She comes to you late at night’s the time you hear her say once again
I’m waitin’ for you thirty days and nights without a rest
I got to hold on twenty-five to go and once again I’ll hear you say

I’m waiting at the gate looking for my ride
Soon to take me to my home on high
Angel bands a coming From the other side
I don’t want to be late I’m waiting at the gate
   I can hear the thunder the time’s at hand
   Joybells are ringing in the promised land
   Jesus is a coming my soul to take
   Yes my Lord sees me waiting at the gate
I’m a’ leaving the world no more to do
All of my work on earth is through
I’ve fought the fight I’ve kept the faith
Well I’m ready to go I’m waiting at the gate

   I’m waiting tonite for you to tell me that you still love me and you will remain
   My heart is breaking with each passing hour please don’t let me love you in vain
I used to think your love would always save me and that you’d always stay right by my side
But I can see a change coming o’er you and the tears I cry just can’t hide
I can’t pretend that love is just a pastime and that you never meant a thing to me
So darlin please don’t leave me all alone sorrounded by your memory

I was born one morning
Rain was pouring down
I heard my mammy say to my daddy
Call the boy John Henry Brown
   Walk on boy
   Walk on down the road
   There ain’t nobody in this whole wide world
   Gonna help you carry your load
   Walk on boy
I left home one evening
Just about the age of ten
I got me a job on the levee lord
Toting water to the hard working men
Well the rich men make all the money
The poor man do all the work
The rich man living mighty high on the hog
Poor man live on the dirt
My old pappy told me
Just on thing to do
Find a good woman be good to her
And she gonna be good to you
Now you all heard this story
Bout the hammer that weighed nine pounds
The cat what swung it way up on the mountain
Was little John Henry Brown

You say you’re sorry once again dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand dear
But that’s what you told me once before
   Walk softly on this heart of mine love
   Don’t treat it mean and so unkind
   Let it rest in peace and quiet love
   Walk softly on this heart of mine
I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
But please let me down real easy
For loneliness moves in as you move on

Up along the hallway down along the stairs
I can see the pictures that we made down thru the years.
And it makes me blue darlin thinkin of the past
And I’m truly sorry I couldn’t make it last.
   Walk the way the wind blows cry the tears I cry
   Hoping for you darlin to be here by my side
   I gotta do some thinking of where to go from here
   Walk the way the wind blows wipe away the tears
I remember darlin when you first came to me
All the year was sweetness and all our time was free
Like the leaves that whither our hearts fell away
Think i’ll just go out alone and walk my blues away

   Well I’m walking down the line
   I’m walking down the line
   I’m walking down the line
   My feet’ll be a flyin’
   To tell about my troubled mind
I’ve got a heavy headed gal
I’ve got a heavy headed gal
I’ve got a heavy headed gal
She ain’t a feeling well
When she’s better only time will tell
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
And rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes
I see the morning light
I see the morning light
Well it’s not because I’m an early riser
I didn’t go to sleep last night

Soon I’ll reach the old log cabin
In the distance up ahead
I’ll be home in the blue ridge mountains
Where I’ll rest my weary head
    Walkin on the blue ridge mountains
    Walkin on walkin on
    Walkin on the blue ridge mountains
    Walkin to my blue ridge home
I’ve been lonely for my darlin
Lonely like those lonesome pines
Growin tall on the blue ridge mountains
Round the old home place of mine
Soon I’ll see my friends and loved ones
Some remain some are gone
To the land that’s clear and bluer
Then it is round my blue ridge home

I’m walking the dog I ain’t never blue
I’m walking the dog I ain’t thinking ’bout you
I don’t have no one to tie me down
I’m walking the dog all over the town
Such an easy life I never knew
Until the day that I met you
I’m a carefree lad that’s seen the light
I’m walking the dog all day and all night
I’m full of pep Lord I can’t grow old
I got a one-track mind so I’ve been told
I’m fancy free and I don’t worry no how
I’m walking the dog all the law will allow

We shall see the desert as the rose
Walking in the kings highway
There’ll be singing where salvation goes
Walking in the kings highway
   There’s a highway there and away
   Where sorrow shall flee away
   And the light shines bright as the day
   Walking in the kings highway
We shall see the glory of the lord
Walking in the kings highway
And behold the glory of his work
Walking in the kings highway
There the rain shall fall upon the ground
Walking in the kings highway
And the springs of water shall be found
Walking in the kings highway
No unclean things shall pass or hear
Walking in the kings highway
Just the ransom ones without a fear
Walking in the kings highway

The wind is blowing ‘cross the mountains
And down on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that’s where I want to go
Lord send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I’ll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die
I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it’s my sweetheart a calling
I hear her through the walls of time
Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love will bloom forever darling
When we rest side by side

When we dance together, my world’s in disguise
It’s a fairyland tale that’s come true
And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you 
        Waltz across Texas with you in my arms
        Waltz across Texas with you
        Like a storybook ending I’m lost in your charms
        And I could waltz across Texas with you
 
My heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
The moment that you come in view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and on
I could waltz across Texas with you

There’s a thought each day that I’m workin
Of my home in a land ‘cross the sea
If I make enough money I’ll find my way back
To my home and my hopes and my dreams
Cast away on a big sailing ship
On the ocean we sailed far away
Rough seas and foul weather made long to the mast
Fearing they would not see the next day
I landed in some unknown country 
No money not even one friend
Wanderlust was the reason I travelled
On a journey that may have no end
I hear my dear mother calling
Her whisper the winds of the bay
Her song a cry for her lost son
While feeling her life pass away
So its memories I keep close beside me
To nourish my poor heardened soul
But I’ll work anywhere there’s some money
Many days have now taken their toll
How many more years will I travel
How many more years all alone
I’m bound to the place far behind me
To the home cross the great ocean foam 
There’s a thought each day that I’m workin
Of my home in a land ‘cross the sea
If I make enough money I’ll find my way back
To my home and my hopes and my dreams
 

I was born in Macon Georgia
They kept my daddy over in Macon jail
He told me if you keep your hands clean
You won’t hear them bloodhounds on your trail
Well I fell in with bad companions
Robbed a man up in Tennessee
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands but they didn’t come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
I asked the judge now when’s my time up
He said son you know we won’t forget
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet
Oh I couldn’t wait to get my time up
I broke out broke out of Nashville jail
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail

The Chickens are crowing in the old pine tree
The Chickens are crowing in the old pine tree
The Chickens are crowing in the old pine tree
Way down in North Carolina
   Water bound and I can’t get home
   Water bound and I can’t get home
   Water bound and I can’t get home
   Down in North Carolina.
Say old man I want your daughter
Say old man I want your daughter
Say old man I want your daughter
Way down in North Carolina.
Tell me boy what you want her for
Tell me boy what you want her for
Tell me boy what you want her for
Down in North Carolina.
To break my bread and share my water
To break my bread and share my water
To break my bread and share my water
Way down in North Carolina.
If you don’t let her go we’re gonna run away
If you don’t let her go we’re gonna run away
If you don’t let her go we’re gonna run away
On back to North Carolina.
The old man’s mad and I don’t care
The old man’s mad and I don’t care
The old man’s mad and I don’t care
As long as I gets his daughter
Get up Jennie and let’s go home
Get up Jennie and let’s go home
Get up Jennie and let’s go home
Before the water rises.

You came to me and said that you were wrong
For leaving me and staying gone so long
You came to me with open arms saying you were home
In my mind I can’t forgive you in my heart I’m all alone
   You say you want to come back
   To our home upon the ridge
   There’s too much water underneath the bridge
A home and a family left behind
Two little children crying all the time
All the things that we worked for didn’t mean that much to you
So how can I forgive you for what you’ve put me through
   You say you want to come back
   To our home upon the ridge
   There’s too much water underneath the bridge
The day you left I walked on down the road
The sky was gray and cloudy and the water looked so cold
At the crossing by the river, thought I’d take the easy way
Then I realized there’s people here that needed me to stay
   So I walked back up the hill
   To our home upon the ridge
There’s too much water underneath the bridge

I went late one night
The moon and stars were shining bright
Storm come up and the trees come down
Tell you boys I was waterbound
Waterbound on a stranger’s shore
River rising to my door
Carried my home to the field below
Waterbound nowhere to go
Carved my name on an old barn wall
No one’d know I was there at all
Stables dry on a winter night
You turn your head you could see the light
Black cat crawling on an old box car
Rusty door and a falling star
Ain’t Got a dime in my rations sack
Waterbound and I can’t get back
It’s I’m gone and I won’t be back
Don’t believe me count my tracks
River’s long and the river’s wide
I’ll meet you boys on the other side
So say my name and don’t forget
Water still ain’t got me yet
Nothing but I’m bound to roam
Waterbound and I can’t get home

See that watermelon a’hanging on the fence
How I wish that melon was mine
Some folks are foolish they just don’t have no sense
Or they wouldn’t leave that melon on the vine
   Hambone it is sweet chicken it is good
   Rabbit is so very very fine
   But give me oh give me oh how I wish you would
   That watermelon hanging on the vine
You may talk about your peaches your apples and your pears
Simmons growing on the tree
Folks have their favorites just most every where
But that watermelon is the best for me
I went to get that melon I thought I’d have some fun
The stars they had just begun to shine
But when I heard some moving I left there on the run
But I didn’t leave that melon on the vine

   Oh, the waves on the sea, how they roll
   And the chilly winds, how they do blow;
   My own true love got drownded in the deep
   And the ship never got to the shore
Oh the first on the deck was the porter of the ship
And a rough-looking fellow was he;
Says, ” I care no more for my wife and my child
Than I do for the fish in the sea”
Well, I left my dear darling a-grieving
Well, I left my dear darling a-grieving
Well, I left my dear darling a-grieving after me
For I never expect to see her any more

Well late last night when Willie came home
I heard him a-rapping on the door
Slipping and a-sliding with his new shoes on
Willie don’t you rap no more
   Oh me, oh my
   What’s gonna become of me
   Been downtown, a fooling around
   No one to cry for me
I like the hills of West Virginia
I like the hills of Tennessee
North, south, east or west
It’s home sweet home to me
It’s one old shirt is all I have
And a dollar is all I crave
Ain’t brought nothing with me into this world
Ain’t gonna take nothing to the grave

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there’s no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
   I’m going there to see my father
   I’m going there no more to roam
   I’m only going over Jordan
   I’m only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather ’round me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God’s redeemed their vigils keep
I’m going there to see my mother
She said she’d meet me when I come
I’m only going over Jordan
I’m only going over home

I saw a wayward traveler in tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad
His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone,
It [sic] shouted as he journeyed, ”Deliverance will come!”
 Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear
The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty, his step seemed very slow
But he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed, “Deliverance will come!”
The songstress in the arbor, that stood beside the way,
Attracted his attention, inviting his delay
His watchword being “Onward!” he stopped his ears and ran,
Still shouting as he journeyed, ”Deliverance will come!”
While gazing on that city, just o’er that narrow flood,
A band of holy angels came from the throne of God
They bore him on their pinions, they bore the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph, “Deliverance has come!”

Darling you often said you loved me
But you’ve gone on before
You don’t know dear how I miss you
But we can’t be darlings anymore
   Darling I am sad and lonely
   Since you’ve gone on before
   So down here on this lonely earth dear
   We can’t be darlings anymore
Until we meet up there in heaven
And we can walk the golden shore
For down here on this lonely earth dear
We can’t be darlings anymore
I have lost a million tears dear
Since you’ve left this world and gone
But we can never again be darlings
Till we meet around the throne

You can read it in the morning paper
Hear it on the radio
How crime is sweeping the nation
This world is about to go
We need a good old case of salvation
To put the love of God in our soul
We need a shole lot more of Jesus
And a lot less rock and roll
We need more old time camp meetings
And a lot more prayers of faith
Prayers that will move a mountain
Save our souls from the burning wave
We need more old fashioned preachers
Pouring out their hearts in prayer
When you’re in their presence
You know that the Lord is there

We shall meet (we shall meet) where no storm clouds gather
We shall meet (we shall meet) someday
By the river of life sparkling cool and clear
We shall meet (we shall meet) someday
How our heart aches with grief when we say goodbye
We shall meet (we shall meet) someday
Where no sorrow or tears ever dims our eyes
We shall meet (we shall meet) someday
What a glorious thought as we say goodbye
We shall meet (we shall meet) someday
In that beautiful home that’s prepared on high
We shall meet (we shall meet) someday

On the resurrection morning
When the trumpet of God shall sound
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
Then the saints shall come rejoicing
And no tears will e’er be found
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
   We shall rise (hallelujah) we shall rise (amen)
   We shall rise (hallelujah) in that resurrection morning
   When these prison bars are broken
   We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
On the resurrection morning
What a meeting it will be
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
When our fathers and mothers and loved ones we’ll see
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
On the resurrection morning
Blessed thought it is to me
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
I will see my blessed savior
Who so freely died for me
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
On the resurrection morning
We shall meet Him in the air
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise
And be carried up to Glory
And our home so bright and fair
We shall rise hallelujah we shall rise

   We will march through the streets of the city
   With our loved ones gone before
   We will sit on the banks of the river
   Where we’ll meet to part no more
Jesus caused me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
And transported by His blood
From that fount of everlasting
To thy heart to sing God’s praise
Dreams of mercy never ceasing
All through songs of loudest praise
Hark the voice of Jesus calling
Who will go and work today
Fields are white and harvest is waiting
Who will bear the sheaves away

The time has come to say goodbye
I’m asking you to please don’t cry
The time to me won’t be so long
To know you’re happy back at home
   Someday we’ll meet again sweetheart
   We’ll meet and never more to part
   Someday we’ll meet again sweetheart
   Don’t cry, so please don’t break my heart
So goodbye now, don’t be blue
Try to be happy and be true
And remember what I say
Sweetheart we’ll meet again someday
Oh sweetheart I’m leaving now
Yes I’ll soon be on my way
Each night upon my knees I pray
Sweetheart we’ll meet again someday

Weary angel of death you’ve claimed another
One so young and so very full of life
Your cold cold hands have reached down to take my darlin
weary angel of death you took my wife
    Now each day I wait for you to come and take me
    To the place where my darlin is gone
    Won’t your reach your icy fingers out to touch me
    Weary angel please don’t make me wait too long
Did you take her cause you needed her like I do
Were you jealous of the love she showed for me
I could never understand no other reason
Why I must live my life in misery
Until then I know in dreams I’ll still see her
For death has only made me love her more
And I know I’ll be ready to go with her
Weary angel when you knock upon my door

    Weary blues from waitin’
    Lord I’ve been waitin’ so long
    These blues have got me cryin’
    Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, please come home
The snow falls ’round my window
But it can’t chill my heart
God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell a-part
Thru tears I watch young lovers
As they go strollin’ by
Oh, all the things that might have been
God forgive me if I cry

Weary day pass away
Look what you have done to me
Just this morning without warning
My love turned her back on me
She was cryin when she left me
Told me she was leavin town
It’s an awful awful feeling
When your lover turns you down
   Like a lonesome dove a grieving
   For a love that can’t found
   It’s an awful, awful feeling
   When your lover turns you down
I have never been so lonely
Since I saw her catch that train
Something awful seems to whisper
She will not be back again
When I see that sun a sinking
Sinking down into the west
I’ll be thinking of my little darlin
She’s the one that I love best

I’ve got them weary weary (lonesome) blues
Feeling lonesome ’bout to cry
I turned my back on my true love
Can’t tell the day from night
I’m going down and catch a train (train train)
Never coming back again
I’ve got them weary weary (lonesome) blues
I’m gonna ride them all away
I’ve got them weary weary (lonesome) blues
I found out that love don’t pay
The only one that I did love   
She has gone the other way
I can’t smile as I used to (used to)
‘Cause her love has proved untrue
I’ve got them weary weary (lonesome) blues
And I don’t know what to do
I’ve got them weary weary (lonesome) blues
Going to pack my grip and go
I hate to turn my back on you
For you know I love you so
But you will never love me (love me) dear
So I’m drifting away from here
I’ve got the weary weary (lonesome) blues
I’m in the way when I am here

God is calling us now so come without delay
Hear oh hear Him calling calling now for thee
Patient, loving and tender but still fatherly
Hear His loving voice calling still (calling still)
   Calling out for thee
   Oh weary (weary prodigal son) prodigal son (weary prodigal son)
   Calling out for thee
   Oh weary (weary prodigal son) prodigal son (weary prodigal son)
Come there’s bread in the house of the father and His fair
Hear oh hear Him calling calling out for thee
Low the table spread and a feast is waiting there
Hear His loving voice calling still (calling still)

The road that winds back so deep in the mountains
Is a lonesome old place now that you’re gone
The mistakes that I’ve made I still think about ’em
As I come to the place I used to call home
   There’s a small rocky path leads back from the home place
   As I walk the last hill the wind seems to moan
   Once again the moon shines and a tear rolls from my face
   As I place a small rose on a weathered gray stone
The moon cuts a path so deep in the mountains
It lights up the hills where we used to roam
Once again the moon shines and a tear rolls from my face
Once again the moon hides I’m in darkness alone
If I had but one chance dear God I would never
Leave my little darlin so cold and alone
My mind’ll be tormented I know now forever
Since they buried my heart ‘neath a weathered gray stone

I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn’t stand to see you wed another
But dear I hope you’re happy just the same
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you’re walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought someday I’d place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I hear the children laughing now with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
How fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your fair
While the organ plays I Love You Truly
Just let me pretend that I am there
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But wedding bells will never ring for me

Today I got the letter that you wrote me
You told me soon that you’d be coming home
You ask me to forgive and said you loved me
And said you missed me so since you’ve been gone
I guess I’m just a fool but I’m so lonely
If only for a while you would be true
Yes welcome home my darling I’ll be waiting
The welcome mat is on the step for you
My friends all say I’m crazy to forgive you
But they’re not faced with sorrow such as mine
Now just the thoughts of having you back home dear
Is making me feel better all the time

The wild western hobo who left his happy home
Started upon a western trip all by himself alone
Upon this western trip going to have lots of fun
But upon this western trip this is the song he sung
I stepped up on a platform smoking a cheap cigar
Waiting to catch a freight train to catch an empty car
I buttoned my coat up closely and walked on down the track
I caught the steps of a sleeper car I never did look back
My pocket book is empty my heart is filled with pain
Ten thousand miles away from home hoboing and old freight train

What a friend we have in mother
Who will all our secrets share
We should never keep things from her
Tell her all and she’ll be there
Oh what tender love she gives us
When in sorrow or despair
Tell her gently whisper softly
She will listen she’ll be there
Day by day as she grows older
She’s the nation’s shining sun
Don’t forget the prayers she taught you
You will need them where you are
Though her hair has turned to silver
Send her flowers sweet and fine
Drop a card or send a letter
She’ll be waiting she’ll be there
When her eyes are closed to slumber
Gently kiss her icy brow
Fold her hands upon her bosom
She will rest in Heaven now
When your days are dark and dreary
And your cross is hard to bear
Do not let your memory fail you
Think of mother she’ll be there

Romeo and Juliet Jackie and Jill
Romeo took poison and Jack fell down the hill
Well I’ve  got you and how its gonna turn out I don’t know
But if loving you is killing me Lord what a way to go
If loving you is killing me Lord what a way to go
If there’s a better way to die I don’t want to know
Just wipe that smile off my face and let ’em lay me low
If loving you is killing me Lord what a way to go
If loving you is killing me then I don’t wanna live
Your love may be poison I’ll take all that I can get
Just pour a little in my cup and let me die slow
If loving you is killing me Lord what a way to go
I believe you’re killing me a little more each night
But it feels like I’m in Heaven when you hold me tight
So wrap your arms around me and let your sweet love flow
Cause if loving you is killing me Lord what a way to go

The days have seemed long and I’ve been so lonesome
Recalling those dreams that never came true
The nights have been lonely but now that’s all over
And I’ve paid my debt for trusting in you
   Every day your memory grows dimmer
   The clouds drift away the sunshine peeks through
   Every night no longer you haunt me
   My conscience is clear dear what about you
It’s hard to believe that you are the same one
That once meant so much to our love so true
It’s hard to know I’ve worshipped a false one
But I’ve paid my debt dear what about you

Where is my sailor boy
Oh where is my sailor boy
He lies on the bottom of the deep deep sea
And he can’t come back to me
Please tell me deep blue sea
Is he sleeping peacefully?
The wind from the north is blowing icy cold
Please keep him warm for me
   What does the deep sea say
   Oh what does the deep sea say
   It moans, it groans, it flashes and it foams
   And rolls on its weary way
I stand on the beach alone
And gaze at the misty blue
Deep sea as you hold him to your breast
Does he mention my name to you
If only my dreaming soul
Some token of love could find
If only a wave would show my where he sleeps
Then I’d leave this world behind
A beautiful rose one day
I placed on the crest of a wave
Deep sea take it please
And lay it so it falls above his watery grave
The driftwood I watched in vain
My rose never came back again
Deep sea take another message to my love
Saying I’ll meet him above

You were my hearts desire you set the flame of love on fire
No other love cold take the place of you
Then you left me all alone so lonesome and so blue
And I found someone to take your place what was I suppose to do
   Was I to walk the floor and worry over endless days to come
   Or cry and plead down on my knees for you
   I couldn’t stand to be alone you left me nothing else to choose
   So I found someone to take your place what was I suppose to do
I know I vowed there’d never be no other love
The dream that I’d been searching for was you
But then that dream came to an end there was no use to pretend
So I found someone to take your place what was I suppose to do

Brother afar from your savior today
Risking your soul for the things that decay
Oh, if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
   What would you give (in exchange)
   What would you give (in exchange)
   What would you give in exchange for your soul
   Oh, if today God should call you away
   What would you give in exchange for your soul
Mercy is calling won’t you give heed
Must the dear Savior still tenderly plead
Risk not your soul, it is precious indeed
What would you give in exchange for your soul
More than the silver and gold of this earth
More than all jewels the spirit is worth
God the creator has given His word
What would you give in exchange for your soul

If you think it’s nice to be untrue
Then don’t complain if I start cheating too
Should I be bound while you go fancy free
What’s Good for you should be all right for me
   If it’s right for you to cheat and lie
   It can’t be wrong for me to break a tie
   Should I be bound while you go fancy free
   What’s Good for you should be all right for me
If it’s fair for you to run around
How can you feel that I should be tied down
I’m human too so why can’t you agree
What’s Good for you should be all right for me

All alone down on my luck
I was down to my last buck
I’d do anything for money
Short of stealin’
So I get up from my bed
Shake the memories from my head
And look out through the window pane
On Wheeling
In this same old room last night
Two loving arms held me so tight
And the words she said
I found myself believing
Ah but this morning she’s gone
Left me to face the lonely dawn
Gonna bid farewell to that lyin’ gal
In Wheeling
That old memory sure looks cold
This old town is covered with snow
And the way I feel Lord
Life ain’t worth living
I’m gonna cross that big old bridge
Gonna climb that Ohio ridge
Gonna turn my back on this lonesome town
Called Wheeling
Wheeling Wheeling
Your’e a lonesome town Wheeling
But I’m leaving just like I come
Broke and hungry and on the bum
But I won’t forget the girl I met
In Wheeling

When autumn leaves begin to fall
It’s then I hear my mother call
Her tender voice I hear in song
I ask forgiveness for each wrong
When a boy of only fifteen years
I left home in seach of new frontiers
A house of gold I then did wed
A wall of stone I built within
Now my mother she has passed away
Not one kindness did I show or say
For all the wealth I might have shared
Mother never knew I cared

Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way
I was wretched and blind as could be
But my Savior in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
   When the Savior reached down for me
   When he reached down his hand for me
   I was lost and undone without God or his Son
   When he reached down his hand for me
How my heart does rejoice when I hear his sweet voice
In a tempest to him I can cling
I can lean on his arm safe and sure from all harm
When he reaches down his hand for me

I rushed home from work like I always do
Spent my whole day just thinking of you
As I walked through the front door my whole life changed
‘Cause nobody answers when I call your name
   The lonely sound of my voice calling
   Is driving me insane
   And just like rain, the tears keep falling,
   ‘Cause nobody answers when I call your name
A note on the table that told me goodbye
Said you’d grown weary of living a lie
Oh, your love has ended but mine still remains
And nobody answers when I call your name

When I can read my titles clear
Two mansions in the sky
I bid farewell to every fear
And wipe my weepin eyes
And wipe my weeping eye
And wipe my weeping eye
I bid farewell to every fear
And wipe my weeping eye
Should cares like a wild deluge come
And storms of sorry fall
By grace I’ll safely reach my home
My God my heaven my all
My God my heaven my all
My God my heaven my all
By grace I’ll safely reach my home
My God my heaven my all
There may I bathe my weary soul
In streams of heavenly rest
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast
Across my peaceful breast
Across my peaceful breast
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast

When my Savior calls me over yonder
I’ll have me a mansion on the other side
Gonna tell my neighbor how glad I am to see him
When I get home I’m going be satisfied
I’ll have me a harp of gold just like David’s
When i get over on the other side
Gonna sing and play with a band of a million angels
When I get home I’m gonna be satisfied
I’ll have a little talk with Abraham and Isaac
Have a little talk with Peter James and Paul
Gonna sit  and have a talk with dad and mother
Gonna have a talk with Jesus first of all
Now when I meet my Savior over yonder
I’ll have me a mansion on the other side
I’ll leave my worldly troubles here behind me
When I get home I’m going be satisfied

The worst that I’ve ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone new
And asked me if I could forget
   When I stop dreaming
   That’s when I’ll stop loving you
I’d be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected transplanted in vain
To a garden of sadness where it’s pedals will fall
In the shadow of undying pain
You can teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You can teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can’t teach my heart to forget

You’re gonna miss when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss when I’m gone
Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me by my walk
You’re gonna miss me by my talk
Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
   When I’m gone (when I’m gone) when I’m gone (when I’m gone)
   Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
   When I’m gone (when I’m gone) when I’m gone (when I’m gone)
   Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me by my prayers
You’re gonna miss me everywhere
Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me by my song
You’re gonna miss me all day long
Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me by my ways
You’re gonna miss me every day
Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me by my song
You’re gonna miss me all day long
Oh I know you will miss when I’m gone

Oh the stars and the silver moon is shining
All around is the sweetness of the spring
But I’m sad and in loneliness I’m pining
For the one I know I’ll never see again
   How I long for the day when I shall see her
   If it be where the angels sweetly sing
   She is mine and the thought of her grows sweeter
   When it’s time for the whippoorwill to sing
When I left with the thought I’d be returning
Soon to her with the wealth and joy I’d bring
I returned but too late and now I’m yearning
She is gone and in loneliness I sing
I remember the night she made the promise
And these words said to me great joy did bring
I’ll be true and you know you’ll find me waiting
When it’s time for the whippoorwill to sing

There’s a lamp shining bright in a cabin
In the window it’s shining for me
And I know that my mother is praying
For the boy she is longing to see
 When it’s lamp lighting time in the valley
Still in dreams I go back to my home
I can see that old lamp in the window
It will guide me wherever I roam.
In the lamplight tonight I can see her
As she rocks in her chair to and fro
Though she prays that I’ll come back to see her
Still I know that I never can go.
 When it’s lamp lighting time in the valley
Still in dreams I go back to my home
But I’ve sinned ‘gainst my home and my loved ones
And now i must ever more roam
So she lights up the lamp and sits waiting
For she knows not the crime i have done
So I’ve changed all my ways and I’ll meet her
Up in heaven when life’s race is run.
 When it’s lamp lighting time in the valley
Still in dreams I go back to my home
Oh I can see that old lamp in the window
It will guide me wherever I roam

I know that Jesus will never forsake
His love will find a way
He’ll bridge the stream if his hand I will take
When he calls what can I say
   Day follows night night follows day
   Farther and farther I roam
   What will my answer be what can I say
   When Jesus beckons my home
Sometimes the clouds seem to cover his face
Sometimes the skies are so gray
Still by the stars and his wonderful grace
He’ll roll the storm clouds away

Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But some day they’ll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
   When my blue moon turns to gold again
   When the rainbow turns the clouds away
   When my blue moon turns to gold again
   You’ll be back within my arms to stay
The lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams they live again, sweetheart
But my golden moon is just a memory
The castles we built of dreams together
Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way
I was wretched and blind as could be
But my Savior in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me 
   When the Savior reached down for me
   When he reached way down for me
   I was lost and undone without God or his Son
   When he reached down his hand for me 
How my heart does rejoice when I hear his sweet voice
In the tempest to him I can cling
There to lean on his arm safe secure from all harm
When he reached down his hand for me

Darlin’, we are growing old
And show the silver in our hair
Since time has stolen all the gold
That made your youthful tresses fair
But years can never steal away
A look that never can grow old
What care we for tresses gray
Since love will always keep its gold
Love, I’ll tell you with a kiss
If Heaven gives back the youth we miss
Your face will be no fairer then
When silver threads are gold again
Darlin’, I can read today
The question in your thoughtful eyes
You wonder if I wish for May
Beneath the frosty autumn skies
Love of mine, be sure of this
For me, no face could be so fair
Than this one that I stoop to kiss
Beneath its crown of silver hair
Darlin’, with your hand in mine
We’ll journey all life’s pathway through
With happy tears your dear eyes shine
Like deep blue blossoms in the dew
The sorrow of the passing years
Have made us love each other more
And every day that disappears
I count you dearer than before
Love, I’ll tell you with a kiss
If Heaven gives back the youth we miss
Your face will be no fairer then
When silver threads are gold again

I am growing old and feeble
Friends and loved ones I must leave
For tomorrow I’ll be lifted
When the angels come for me
When the angels come to get me
In a chariot of pure gold
I’ll be carried up to heaven
On that hallelujah road
Life down here has been so happy
Through this world which I’ve trod
But I’ll move into a mansion
Where I’ll dwell forever more
There I’ll be with my dear Savior
Dad and Mother I will see
All these joys will be mine forever
When the angels come for me

By the mill stream sits the Miller’s pretty daughter
Her cheeks are like the first red rose of June
Her sweet voice sounds just like the rippling water
As so tenderly she hums an old love tune
But soon her song of joy has turned to sorrow
Her sweetheart now has come to say goodbye
She thinks of a sad and lonely morrow
And he hugs her as she murmers with a sigh
   When the bees are in the hive and the honey in the comb
   And the golden sunlight bends to kiss the dew
   While the old mill wheel turns ’round I love you Mary
   And when the bees are in the hive I’ll come to you
By the old mill sits the lonely maid repining
And her face was like the spring rose far away
While she looked down in the silver waters shining
And she sees her golden locks are dimmed with grey
Long years she’s waited there for his returning
All in vain she’s thinking he’ll come back someday
For the lamp of hope still in her heart is burning
As the old mill wheel turns ’round it seems to say

I’m the laugh of the party out every night
Ain’t got a worry but then
The people who say I’m carefree and gay
Don’t know how I’m lonely when the bright lights grow dim
People think cause I’m laughing the past is behind
But they don’t know the sorrow within’
A heart that is hurtin’ in a man bound by pride
Who cries for an old love when the bright lights grow dim
When the party has ended the laughter has died
And I think of our parting again
The smile leaves my face and tears take its place
I cry for you darling when the bright lights grow dim
So until you return I’ll keep wearing a mask
That will hide how I’m feeling within
So if your lonely too I’ll be right there with you
I’ll be thinking of you dear when the bright lights grow dim

When this evening sun goes down
Then in heaven I will be found
I will end life’s other side
When I cross the great divide
When this evening sun goes down
When I wear my starry crown
When I’ll see a smiling face
And rest in amazing grace
He will wipe away my tears
He will blind me to all my fears
Then in joy I’ll ever be bound
When this evening sun goes down
When this evening sun goes down
When they lay me ‘neath the ground
When we’ll meet, weep, and mourn
Then I’ll be in my heavenly home

I left the one that love in the mountains
And all the love we shared
But each night as she kneels by her bed side
I know she calls my name in her prayer
   When the moon shines on the Blue Ridge mountains
   And it seems I can hear my sweetheart call
   How I long to be near to my darling
   When the golden leaves begin to fall
She knows that I’ll return to the mountains
And will bring to her a wedding ring
It will be placed upon her finger
Happiness to us both it will bring
Winter time is so cold in the mountains
The ground will soon be covered white with snow
How I long to keep the home fires burning
For I know my darling needs me so

    When the mountain dew starts falling
    And the green green grass begins to grow
    That’s when I realize I love you
    That’s why I’m on my way back home
Back to the one I love so dearly
Back to the one that I love so
back to that girl I spent some time with
Back to my little mountain home
I’ve been away from my home for so long dear
And I feel like a stranger in my home
No one will ever realize dear
That I’m just a drifter all alone

All day long the thoughts of you
Stay far away since we are through
But in the middle of the night when the nightbirds call
That’s when I’ll miss you most of all
   When the nightbirds cry and the wind is still
   I hear the call of the whipporwill
   It says you’re gone but I don’t know why
   That’s why I’m blue when the nightbirds cry
I sit all night on the edge of my bed

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved on earth shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there
   When the roll (when the roll) is called up yonder
   When the roll (when the roll) is called up yonder
   When the roll (when the roll) is called up yonder
   When the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there
On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall
rise
And the glory of His resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there
Let us labor for the Master from the dawn til setting sun
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care
Then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there

When The Roses Bloom In Dixieland I am coming home to you
When the band is playing music grand to the sweetest girl I ever knew
I’m saving up my money, to buy a little cabin home for two
When The Roses Bloom In Dixieland I am coming home to you
I met my honey at the railroad track, I said honey wait for me
I’m going to make a lot of money up north and it’s me for old Tennessee
I’m saving up my money, to buy a little cabin home for two
When The Roses Bloom In Dixieland I am coming home to you

Neath the shadow down the meadow
Leaves lying on each side
By the river flowers shiver
Fading dying in their pride
Someone straying long delaying
Sad the parting down the lane
I must leave you someone’s saying
Till the roses come again
   When the roses come again
   When the roses come again
   I will meet you I will greet you
   When the roses come again
   
   Yodel
As I wander I will ponder
On a happy by and by
On a summer over yonder
With joy to you and I
Do not borrow grief or sorrow
In the hours that yet remain
We shall know of that tomorrow
When the roses come again
Sunshine over clover
Blossom on the meadow wide
Some I finger sweet to linger
Everywhere on every side
Someone’s roaming in the gloaming
Happy hearts that feel no pain
All their sadness turned to gladness
Now the roses come again

When my labor here is over at last and I lay these burdens down
I’ll sail away home to Heaven above for my Savior I have found
I’ll lay these burdens down at His feet and exchange them for a crown
I’ll leave this world of trouble and sorrow when the sun of my life goes down
    Oh Lord I know I’m living on higher ground
    I know because in my heart’s true love I’ve found
    And when I hear Gabriel’s trumpet loudly sound
    I’ll leave this world of trouble and sorrow when the sun of my life goes
To this changing world I bid farewell when I hear that trumpet sound
I’ll sail away to heaven above for my Savior I have found
I’ve made my plans I’m ready to go I’ll wear a robe and crown
And I’ll meet my friends and loved ones up yonder when the sun of my life goes down

There’s an old and rusty wagon that’s left to rot away
It’s one my family rode in back in the good old days
People loved their neighbors everybody was so free
And riding in a brand new wagon was something to see
I can still see my Daddy sitting on the wagon seat
Mom in her old sun bonnet she looked so nice and neat
Kids were all in the wagon Grandma and Grandpa too
Oh we used to go to church on Sunday when the wagon was new
Red wheels were on the wagon and the body it was green
We were all so happy as riding in a limousine
People used to gather round through all the mountain side
Take a look at the brand new wagon and all take a ride
Well the automobiles are here now the wagon days are through
Airplanes are a-humming neighbors are so few
Everybody’s in a hurry it’s money that takes you through
But we didn’t need much money when the wagon was new

Oh my loving mother when the world’s on fire
Don’t you want God’s bosom to be your pillow
Hide thee over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages clef for me
I’m going to heaven when the world’s on fire
And I want God’s bosom to be your pillow
Hide thee over in the rock of ages
Rock of ages clef for me
Oh my loving brother
Oh my loving sinner
Don’t you want to go to heaven…

Oh I’m thinking of you, little darling
On the day that we first met
And those words sweetheart that you told me
I’m sure I’ll never forget
   Oh, someday, sweetheart, when you’re lonely
   And have no one to care for you
   Remember the heart you have broken
   And the one that has loved you so true
You told me that you always would love me
That no one could ever come between
But it seems to me you’ve forgotten
All those things you told to me
I’ll forget all those things that you told me
And try to start our life anew
But remember the heart you have broken
And the one that has loved you so true

   When you go walking after midnight
   Over on the wrong side of town
   Walk down any street many lost souls you’ll meet
   Whose lives are broken like mine
You’ll find souls wandering out in darkness
Whose place in life they’ll never find
Wandering so aimless and hopelessly
Whose lives are broken like mine
Thank God you’ve got a home to go to
And a woman’s love to keep you warm
You won’t find the stars in the honky-tonk and bars
Go home to your woman’s loving arms

My eyes are getting weaker my steps are getting slow
And the gray in my hair is beginning to show
My life has been rich though I’ve always been poor
Our youth passed so quickly where did our young years go
There’s something between us so few understand
You made me your king though I’m a plain working man
Our home and our babies have left our love aglow
But where oh where did our young years go
Your face may be wrinkled your dress may be worn
But your lips are still tender thrilling and warm
Each day of life our love seems to grow
But where oh where did our young years go

Where is my wandering boy tonight
The boy of my tenderest care
The boy that was once my joy and light
The child of my love and prayer
   Where is my boy tonight
   Where is my boy tonight
   My heart o’erflows for I love him he knows
   Oh where is my boy tonight
Once he was pure as morning dew
As he knelt at his mother’s knee
No face was so bright no heart more true
And none was so sweet as he
Oh chould I see you now my boy
As fair as in olden time
When prattle and smile made home a joy
And life was a merry chime
Go for my wand’ring boy tonight
Go search for him where you will
But bring him to me with all his blight
And tell him I love him still

Judgment day is drawing nigh
Where shall I be
When God the work of men shall cry
Where shall I be
When east and west the fire will roll
Where shall I be
How will it be with my poor soul
Where shall I be
   Oh where shall I be when the first trumpet sounds
   Oh where shall I be when it sounds so loud
   When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead
   Oh where shall I be when it sounds
When wicked men its wrath shall see
Where shall I be
And to the rocks and mountains flee
Where shall I be
And hills and mountains wear away
Where shall I be
And all the work of men decay
Where shall I be
When the savior reigns from shore to shore
When God’s angry presence roars
   Oh I’ll be sleeping in my grave when the first trumpet sounds
   Oh I’ll be sleeping in my grave when it sounds so loud
   When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead
   Oh I’ll be sleeping in my grave when it sounds

In withered fields homes like soldiers now stand
Distant hills alone no more to be
And the city is a ragin’ fire
Cast about upon the lone prairie
We don’t know where the city begins
We don’t know where the city ends
What is left of the wild and free
Is the seed upon the wind and the waves upon the sea
The dust of dreams that could be brought
To every Oklahoma child
Is the dust below the buffalo
That lies still beneath the highway miles
Where rivers flow the path a tortured road
Promised angels from desert land
Mighty waters just a name and a dream
Colorado Black and Rio Grande

Tonight the music echoes from a bar just down the street
That’s where my sweetheart’s waiting, a new love there to meet
She’ll laugh, dance, and mix it with the wild and wicked crowd
Where the dim lights are the dimmest and the music’s always loud 
   What a shame to know I’ve lost her, it’s something I can’t bear
   My mind is slowly breaking, knowing she don’t care
   The honky tonk now claims her, she’s now one of the crowd
   Where the dim lights are the dimmest and the music’s always loud 
I know she’s out there dancing to a song that we love so
The liquor keeps her swinging, the wine keeps her afloat
I’ve lost her to another, it makes no difference now
Where the dim lights are the dimmest and the music’s much too loud

I’m dreamin’ tonight of Dixie cotton fields and whippoorwills
Where I spent my happy childhood ‘neath the rocks and among the rills
I can see my dear old mother as around the place she goes
On the farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows
    Ah-lee-oh-de-lady-oo
    You can hear the old folks singin’ soft and low
    At the twilight in the evening so low so low
    On the farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows
The lights so bright on Broadway the city’s bright as day,
And there on Coney Island where the ripplin’ waters play
I’ll be headin’ south for Dixie on that I. C. when she goes
To my farm in farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

The twilight softly gathered
Round my home among the hills
And all nature soon will settle away to rest
While I sit and sadly ponder
And my heart with longing fills
As I often think of one that I love best
We were wedded in the springtime
And our hearts they knew no pain
Fair nature seemed to smile on us that day
Now she sleeps beneath the lilacs
And she’ll ne’er come back again
Where the silver Colorado wends its way
   There’s a sob on every breeze
   And a sigh comes from the trees
   And the mocking birds they sing a sadder way
   For the flowers creep no more
   Round my cheerless cabin door
   Where the silver Colorado wends its way
The silver snow is gleaming
On your distant mountainside
Where often used to wander Nell and I
And the birds are singing gaily
In the valley far below
Where I long some day to lay me down and die
Then our lives were gay and happy
In the shadow of the hills
My heart beats fonder for her day by day
And I feel her presence near me
As I sit alone tonight
Where the silver Colorado wends its way

To Canaan’s land I’m on my way
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) never dies
   (lead)
   No sad farewells
   No tear dimmed eyes
   Where all is love
   And the soul never dies
   (tenor)
   Dear friends there’ll be no sad farewells
   There’ll be no tear-dimmed eyes
   Where all is peace and joy and love
   And the soul of man never dies
The rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies
The love light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines and lights the way to home
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And everlasting joys I’ll reap
Where the soul (of man) never dies
I’m on my way to that fair land
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul (of man) never dies

Where the wild wild flowers grow cool clear waters flow
There’s a place that I’ve always love the best
When at last I lay me down final peace and rest I’ve found
Take me on to my home and there I’ll rest
Take me on to my home and there I’ll rest
When as a little child hopes dreams runnin wild
Some day I’ll live just like a queen upon a throne
Little did a poor girl know how hard the way to go
Oh I wandered yes I wandered far from home
Oh I wandered yes I wandered far from home
Freedom was in the air you could feel it everywhere
Don’t be blinded it’s God’s gift can’t you see
Never lay your armor down til peace and rest you’ve found
Goin home goin home to be free
Goin home goin home to be free

Where can I find some peace for my mind
I feel that my heart has grown cold
You left me alone this wide world to roam
So I’m bound where the wild river rolls
I’m bound where the wild river rolls
I’m bound where the tall pine trees grow
The cost of your love has taken its toll
So I’m bound where the wild river rolls
Five long years I have waited in vain
Hoping for you to come home
I told you that I couldn’t live without your love
So I’m bound where the wild river rolls

Where the wild wild flowers grow and winter waters flow
There’s a place that I’ve always loved the best
When at last I lay me down final peace and rest I’ve found
Take me home to my own and there I’ll rest
Take me home to my own and there I’ll rest
When as a little child hopes dreams runnin wild
Someday I’d live just like a queen a throne
Little did a poor girl how hard the way to go
So I wandered yes I wandered far from home
Yes I wandered oh I wandered far from home
Freedom was in the air you could feel it everywhere
Don’t be blinded it’s Gods gift can’t you see
Never lay your armor down til peace and rest you’ve found
Going home going home to be free
Going home going home to be free

Sinner why not heed the day won’t you come and go this way
Where Jesus lives and we’ll never say goodbye
To a home that’s far and bright and there never is a night
In a land where we never shall die
   I’ve a home way up on high where we shall live and never die
   Won’t you come and cross this river so wide
   There with Jesus we will dwell never more to say farewell
   In a land where we never shall die
Walk the straight the narrow way fall down on your knees and pray
God will help you cross the mountaintop so high
He will take you by the hand lead you to that promised land
In a land where we never shall die

I have heard of a land on the far away strand
‘Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die
‘Tis a land where we never grow old 
   Never grow old, never grow old
   In a land where we’ll never grow old
   Never grow old, never grow old
   In a land where we’ll never grow old 
In that beautiful home where we’ll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
‘Tis a land where we never shall die 
When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And out troubles and trials are o’er
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who’ve gone on before

    I am going in the morning
    And in glory I shall dwell
    In that home that’s free from sadness
    Where we’ll never say farewell
Friends this day I hope to meet you
In that home bye and bye
There we’ll live up there forever
In that home beyond the sky
If you live for the Savior
He will walk by your side
And you’ll be with him forever
In that happy home on high
 

   Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
   Where is that peaceful land
   Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
   Where the beasts won’t steal my lambs
We’ve travelled far shepherd dog and I
Weary sin sick in sore
Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
I’ll shelter my sheep at God’s door
My soul is weak and thirsty too
As I cross these burning sands
Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
Where is that peaceful land

Tonight while I’m reading your letter
You tell me you’re going far away
I love you my darling yes I love you
I love you where ever you stray
I can see your blue eyes smiling for me
And they sparkle like no others do
You told me once you’d always love me
You said that you’d always be true
If ever you are lonely little darling
And no one has taken my place
Remember my darling I still love you
And long for your sweet smiling face

Wish I was down in Florida Florida on the hog
Stead of way up in old Georgia boys treated like a dog
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
Seaboard train a rollin down that iron seaboard line
Catch ‘er for Dunnellon gonna ease my worried mind
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
Way down on the corner see the big parade go by
Wish I’s in the brass band marchin to the sky
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
All around this country what you think I see
Whiskey dope and women boys done made a wreck of me
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
I cannot stand the government I cannot stand the law
I cannot stand these dark days comin’ on us all
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
Way down at the railroad just walking on the ties
If Buella lands in Florida boys I’ll never say goodbye
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
If I die a roamin in some distant land
you can take me to the graveyard down in alabam’
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
You can take my banjo and hang it by the door
Way down in sunny dixie well I won’t need it no more
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind
It’s fare ye well darlin way on down the line
Fare ye well forever and the songs of Auld Lang Syne
Whiskey deaf and whiskey blind

In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There’s a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
   White dove will mourn in sorrow
   The willows will hang their heads
   I’ll live my life in sorrow
   Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray

I’m goin’ out on that highway listen to them big trucks whine
I’m goin’ out on that highway listen to them big trucks whine
Oh white Freightliner won’t you steal away my mind
There’s bad new from Huston half my friends have died
There’s bad new from Huston half my friends have died
Oh white Freightliner won’t you steal away my mind
New Mexico ain’t bad lord people there treat you kind
New Mexico ain’t bad lord people there they treat you kind
Oh white Freightliner won’t you steal away my mind
Oh lord I’m gonna ramble ’til I get back to where I came
Oh lord I’m gonna ramble ’til I get back to where I came
Oh white Freightliner won’t you steal away my brain

McKinley hollered , McKinley squalled
Doc said “McKinley I can’t find the cause
You’re bound to die, you’re bound to die
Doc told the horse, he’d throw down his rein
He said to the horse you gotta outrun this train
From Buffalo to Washington
The doc came a-running, he took off his specs
Said “Mr Mckinley better cash in your checks
You’ve bound to die, you’re bound to die
Look here, you rascal, you see what you’ve done
Shot down my husband and I’ve got your gun
I’m carrying you back, to Washington
Well, Roosevelt’s in the White House, doing his best
McKinley’s in the graveyard taking his rest
He’s gone, for a long time

   Who can blame you though your heart’s untrue
   When you say it’s my fault anyway
   Turn your head from the tears I’ve shed
   Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
You justify yourself in your love for someone else
When you say I never loved you anyway
Your vows were made in vain although mine have still remained
Though you broke my heart in two who can blame you
In a heart of rusted steel you kept your love affair concealed
‘Til the day she was askin’ you to stay
Turn your head from the tears I’ve shed
Though you broke a heart in two who can blame you

   Who done it who was it broke your heart
   Who done it who keeps us apart
   You gamble with the love I gave until another won it
   So when you find your all alone just ask yourself who done it
There was a time when you were mine and I belonged to you
You broke your vow so listen now while I give you a clue
I gave my heart to someone new because you tried to shun it
You want it back but its to late and your the one who done it
I offered you a bungalow with roses round the door
A diamond ring and everything but still you wanted more
You wanted to run your own life so I just let you run it
And when your dream train jumped the track I guess you know who done it

Who killed Cock Robin
I said the Sparrow with my little bow and arrow
I killed Cock Robin
Who saw him die I said the Fly
With my little eye I saw him die
Who caught his blood I said the Fish
With my little dish I caught his blood
Who’ll make the shroud I said the Beetle
With my thread and needle I’ll make the shroud
Who’ll dig his grave I said the Owl
With my pick and shovel I’ll dig his grave
Who’ll be the parson I said the Rook
With my little book I’ll be the parson
Who’ll be the clerk I said the Lark
If it’s not in the dark I’ll be the clerk
Who’ll carry the link I said the Linnet
I’ll fetch it in a minute I’ll carry the link
Who’ll be chief mourner I said the Dove
I mourn for my love I’ll be chief mourner
Who’ll carry the coffin I said the Kite
If it’s not through the night I’ll carry the coffin
Who’ll bear the pall We said the Wren
Both the cock and the hen we’ll bear the pall
Who’ll sing a psalm I said the Thrush
As she sat on a bush I’ll sing a psalm
Who’ll toll the bell I said the bull
Because I can pull I’ll toll the bell
All the birds of the air fell a-sighing and a-sobbing
When they heard the bell toll for poor Cock Robin

You say you’re sorry that it had to end this way
If I’d just keep my chin up there’d be a brighter day
Honey there’s just one thing before this bridge is burned
I don’t want your sympathy so don’t you be concerned
About what I do who needs you?
Well the hallway’s full of bags and boxes filled with all your things
In that balled-up napkin you’ll find my wedding ring
I’ve seen you pull some fast ones but this time you’ve gone too far
I even took the liberty of gassing up your car.
This time we’re through who needs you?
   Who needs you who needs a heart broke in two?
   Well who needs you babe now that I know your love’s not true
   Who needs your low down ways blue nights and lonely days
   Oh tell me who? Who needs you

Now who will kiss your lips darlin’
Who will call you sweetheart
Oh who will tell you they love you
Oh you once was my little sweetheart
Now who’s been talkin’ to you
Somebody’s been tellin’ you wrong
Things a-bout me that you shouldn’t believe
I miss you sweetheart when you’re gone
This talk that’s goin’ ’round town
Some of it I know is not true
‘Bout the things that I’ve done and the places I’ve been
For darlin’ I’ve always loved you

Oft I sing for my friends
When death’s cold form I see
When I reach my journey’s end
Who will sing for me
   I wonder (I wonder) who
   Will sing (will sing) for me
   When I come to the cross on that silent sea
   Who will sing for me
When crowds shall gather round
And look down on me
Will they turn and walk away
Or will they sing one song for me

Leaves are falling and turning to showers of gold
As the postman climbs up our long hill
And there’s sympathy written all over his face
As he hands me a couple more bills
   Who will watch the home place
   Who will tend my hearts dear space
   Who will fill my empty place
   When I am gone from here
There’s a lovely green nook by a clear-running stream
It was my place when I was quite small
And it’s creatures and sounds could soothe my worst pains
But today they don’t ease me at all
In my grandfather’s shed there are hundreds of tools
I know them by feel and by name
And like parts of my body they’ve patched this old place
When I move them they won’t be the same
Now I wander around touching each blessed thing
The chimney the tables the trees
And my memories swirl ’round me like birds on the wing
When I leave here oh who will I be

I wonder tonight who’s loving you
Enjoying the kisses I once knew
And getting those letters of comfort and cheer
Who’s calling you sweetheart tonight my dear
Who’s calling you sweetheart who is the man
So tenderly kissing and holding your hand
Who’s cherishing beauty of eyes so bright
Who’s tenderly calling you sweetheart tonight
Now I’m regretting my life here at last
Cherishing memory of love of the past
Seeking a refuge lasting at my side
Tell me who’s calling you sweetheart tonight

Whiskey by the gallon
sugar by the pound
Great big bowl to put it in
And a spoon to stir it round
    Who’s going down to town
    Who’s going down to town
    Who’s going down to Welmingtown
    To carry my tobacco round
Once I had an old coon dog
And I wish I had him back
He chase the big dogs over the fence
And the little ones through the cracks
And once I had a little girl
I brought her from the south
She’s braid her hair so doggone tight
She couldn’t close her mouth
 

Who’s gonna shoe your pretty little foot
Who’s gonna glove your hand
Who’s gonna kiss your red ruby lips
Who’s gonna be your man
Papa will shoe my pretty little foot
Mama will glove my hand
Sister’s gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don’t need no man
I don’t need no man poor boy
I don’t need no man
Sister’s gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don’t need no man
Longest train I ever did see
Was sixteen coaches long
The only girl ever did love
Was on that train and gone

Whose that knocking at my door, have I heard that knock before
Is it evil trying to get into my room
Who’s that tapping at my window, who’s calling me to go
To a place that’s filled with dark and gloom
Oh this life that I’m living, it seems so unforgiving
I find trouble everywhere that I go
I always seek it first, just to quench my burning thirst
In waters that are cool as fallen snow
But the waters are oh so deep, what you sew you must reap
Now I hear a knocking at my door
It’s evil standing outside, there’s no place to run and hide
It plucks my soul and presses me to the floor
Oh I’ve been down that pathway, it always leads the wrong way
But this time I don’t think I’ll be back
Feels like a freight train pulling me, there’s a dark tunnel ahead I see
This train’s going down a one-way track

Who’s that knocking at my window
Knocks so loud and won’t come in
It is your own true-hearted lover
Rise you up and let him in
Awake, awake, don’t wake my mother
Our love’s a thing she can’t endure
She’s been the ruin of many a lover
She’ll be the ruin of many more
Awake, awake, don’t wake my father
For he is on his bed of rest
And on his breast he carries a weapon
To kill the one that I love best
I wish I was a little sparrow
I’d circle like a turtledove
I’d fly away to a lonely valley
And settle down in the land of love

Once you were my life and breath
Then you rode your free horse to death
Oh, you trifled around too much
Then you lost your loving touch
Now whose shoulder will you cry on
   You didn’t love me all along
   ‘Cause you can’t love and do me wrong
   I don’t trust you anymore
   So go knock on another’s door
   And whose shoulder will you cry on
Just let those hot tears burn your eyes
They’re just payments on the lies
That made a wreck of me
From that chain I’ve been set free
Now whose shoulder will you cry on

   Oh, why oh why did you wander
   Why did you ever roam
   When you know that we always were happy
   All alone in our old mountain home
It was down in the old Cumberland Mountains
Down in the hills of Tennessee
As she waited alone in the moonlight
It was there that she waited for me
Oh why did you leave me little darling
Why did you leave me alone
For you knew I’d be lonely without you
All alone in our old mountain home
I hope you will always be happy
No matter where you may roam
And I long to be with you up in heaven
As we were in our old mountain home

Why do you cry little darlin
Why are those tears in your eyes
Why do you weep little darlin
Just when I say goodbye
It makes me sad and lonely
To see you feel so blue
What have I done little darlin
I have I been untrue to you
Cause you are called little darlin
To fight for your country true
There’s many a poor girl just like me
Weeping for their sweetheart too
I’ve tried so hard to be cheerful
But thought of all the long years
You might be gone little darlin
I could not keep back my tears
That’s why I cry little darlin
Because you’re going away
Leaving me all broken hearted
To weep for you day after day
Every night I’ll kneel by my bedside
And ask God to guide you each day
Back to your sweetheart that’s waiting
And loves you more than I can say

I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you still care for me
But somehow you just won’t admit
And that’s why I’m lonesome you see
   Now if you have made up your mind
   And if you still want me you know
   Why do you keep me in doubt
   Why don’t you tell me so
Each night there’s tears upon my pillow
And they’re all because of you I know
Darling I can’t go on this way
Why don’t you tell me so
Now there’ll come a time little darling
When you will want me you know
But darling, it will then be too late
For you to tell me so

I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you still care for me
But somehow you just won’t admit
That’s why it’s so lonely, you see
   Now if you have made up your mind
   And if you still want me to know
   Why do you leave me in doubt
   Why don’t you tell me so
Each night there’s tears upon my pillow
And they’re all because of you I know
Dear I can’t go on this way
Why don’t you tell me so
Now there’ll come a time, little darling
When you will want me to know
But then it will be too late
For you to tell me so

In the beautiful hills way back in Virginia
By the side of his home where he played as a lad
In a deep dark grave Carter lies sleeping
There lies the best friend that I ever had
For twenty one years he travelled this country
Entertaining his friends wherever he roamed
For many thousands he made life brighter
Now he is at rest near his old home
He wrote many songs about the Clinch Mountains
Of mother and dad his friends and home
Through 43 states and many foreign countries
Wherever he travelled his name was known
Now he’s at rest in the family graveyard
On top of a hill where the wind blows o’er
he’s gone on now but he won’t be forgotten
The songs he left will never grow old
He laid down his guitar but he’ll always be remembered
On earth for the last time he sung white dove
Forever in heaven Carter will be singing
Singing with the angels in heaven above

In my life I’ve known sorrow
I’ve seen love fade away
I’ve had tears from sadness
Like those shed today 
My heart was within me
My sadness my own
My thoughts there were anchored
At rest with my soul
 
Then when I met you
I gave you my soul
My heart was between us
No longer my own
All that I know of
And all that I am
Is shared now with you
How can I remain
   
    Oh lord if you’re with me
    Help me find the strength
    My soul lay a-dying
    Why must I remain
And now you are dying
Now you are alone
And I must remain here
Though my world  is gone
And I am no longer
My heart has no home
There could be no other, God
Don’t leave me alone

I once loved a beautiful maiden
As fair as the blue skies above
And each night as we wondered together
The moon seemed to smile on our love
We vowed to be true to each other
And nothing could cause us to part
But we never once dreamed that the future
Held only a broken heart
Then there came the night when we parted
We quarreled as all sweethearts do
And I learned what it was to be jealous
When she told me our love was untrue
She told me she had always been faithful
She swore that her love could not die
And then when I did not believe her
She kissed me and told me goodbye
Yodel
I found I had falsely accused her
And went back to make her my bride
And there in the door stood her mother
She told me my sweetheart had died
I went in and knelt down beside her
And there in the hush of that room
I prayed that my maker would take me
And send my soul down to its doom
So now I have told you the reason
There’s always a tear in my eye
For long weary years I’ve repented
But I’m longing to lay down and die
And I wonder if I’ll be forgiven
When I face the master someday
And I wonder if I’ll see my sweetheart
On that beautiful shore far away

Well every time it rains Lord I run to my window
All I do is ring my hands and mourn
Well listen to that thunder roar
Can’t you hear that lonesome wind moan
Tell me baby now why you been gone so long
   Tell me baby now why you been gone so long
    You been gone so long now
   Tell me baby now why you been gone so long
   Wolfs scratchin at my door lord Lord
   I can hear that lonesome wind blow
   Tell me baby now why you been gone so long
Well someone said they thought they saw you rollin down in Reno
With a big ol man from San Antone
They tell me I’m a fool to pine for you oh what do they know
Tell me baby now why you been gone so long
Ain’t nothin I want to do lord
So I guess I could get stoned
And let the past paint pictures in my head
Drink a fifth of thunderbird and try to write a sad sad song
Tell my baby now why you been gone so long

She went back to Wichita
She went back to her ma and pa
Reckon I saw her next to my truck
Pumping gas with the car packed up.
We talked as neighbors will
There waiting for the tanks to fill
We talked about nothing
how it might snow
How far she had to go.
   Going back where the grass grows tall
   And the fields burn in the fall
   You can still hear the night birds call
   Back in Wichita.
She came in ’85
She came here as a July bride
But it never got easy
never got rich
Ain’t got much but what she came here with.
Good times have all been spent
She ain’t broken but she’s badly bent
There’s nothing she wants here
nothing that shines
She’s made up her mind.
She says for all my time
well I ain’t got much to show
You can tell that man of mine and anyone who wants to know
Going back where the grass grows tall
And the fields burn in the fall
You can still hear the night birds call
Back in Wichita.

In this awful world of sorrow
On this wicked path of sin
Never thinking of tomorrow
Or what I’d lose in the end
   Oh I can hear (oh I can hear) the joy bells ringing
   Where my friends (where my friends) and loved ones wait
   Oh I can hear the angels singing (sweet singing)
   Just inside (just inside) those pearly gates
I can hear my savior calling
Saying come unto me
Wash away your sins forever
And you shall rest eternally
Now I’m safe with my Jesus
He will guide me on my way
I will sing His praise forever
We’ll meet in heaven some sweet day

As I went down for to take a little walk
I came upon that Wild Bill Jones
He was a walking and a talking by my true lover’s side
And I bid him to leave her alone
He said my age is twenty-one
Too old to be controlled
I pulled my revolver from my side
And I destroyed that poor boy’s soul
He reeled and he staggered, and he fell to the ground
And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl’s neck
Saying honey won’t you take me home
So put them handcuffs on me boys
And lead me to that freight car gate
I have no friends or relations there
No-one for to go my bail
So pass around that old long necked bottle
And we’ll all go on a spree
For today was the last of that Wild Bill Jones
And tomorrow will be the last of me
They sent me to prison for twenty long years
This poor boy longs to be free
But Wild Bill Jones and that long-necked bottle
Have been the ruin of me

We grew up living close to each other
Went to school sat side by side
And I longed for the day when I would ask her
If she would be my loving bride.
   I picked some wild mountain flowers for Mary
   And I told her I loved her today
   But she said we never could marry
   That her mother would stand in the way
Her daddy died when she was very young
And she never knew the love of a man
I tried so hard to make her happy
And tried to make her mother understand
Now my days of youth are gone and I’m so happy
And my time isn’t very far away
I pciked some wild mountain flowers for Mary
And placed them on her grave today
I picked some wild mountain flowers for Mary
And placed them on her grave today.

There’s a girl in the mountain that I call my mountain honey
And I love her like the flowers love the dew
All the fellars try to claim her but someday I’m gonna claim her
‘Cause my wild mountain honey loves me to
She’s my wild mountain honey and I love her yes I do
She’s as sweet as any honey in the comb
She’s as pretty as the flowers that are blooming in the mountains
And I’m going to marry her and bring her home
Oh I met her in the Smokey Mountains down in Tennessee
When the mountain laurel was blooming in the spring
Everything is bright and sunny and I’m saving up my money
For my wild mountain honey’s wedding ring

You wouldn’t read my letter if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there’s something I’m wanting to tell you
So I put it in the words of this song
   I didn’t know God made honky tonks angels
   I might have known you’d never make a wife
    You gave up the only one that ever loved you
   And went back to the wild side of life
The glamour of the gay night life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be anybody’s baby
And forget the truest love you will ever know

Oh, I’ll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue
Oh I’ll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away
Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wond’ring no mis’ry can tell
He’s left me no warning, no words of farewell
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life’s dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He’s gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

On cruel Calvary where he suffered
There he died upon the cross
That we might be saved my brother
Freed from sin and not be lost
   Will he wait a little longer
   There’s so many out in sin
   Will he wait a little longer
   Give us time to gather in
A vision of that mangled body
I can see his nail-scarred hands
When He calls me way up yonder
I will hear and understand
Many loved ones gone before me
They’ve made their peace for the final day
But should He call before they’re ready
I can almost him them say

I have changed with changing seasons
I am dimmed with toil and care
When I stand among the angels
Will my mother know me there
   Yes I know that she will know me
   In those mansions bright and fair
   Mother’s love can n’er forget me
   And I’m sure she’ll know me there
All for me my mother wrestled
When she used to kneel in prayer
Do you think we have forgotten
Will my mother know me there
Mothers face has been a beckoned
O’er the sea of deep despair
I shall look for her up yonder
Will my mother know me there

I was standing by the window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
To carry my mother away
   Will the circle be unbroken
   Bye and bye Lord bye and bye
   There’s a better home a waiting
   In the sky Lord in the sky
I said to the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For that body you are carrying
Lord I hate to see her go
Well I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in that grave 
I went back home Lord that home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone

   Will the roses bloom where she lies sleeping
   Will the flowers shed their pedals there
   Will the dewdrops fall upon the roses
   Where my darling sleeps beneath the sand
Her lips were like a bunch of roses
Her eyes were like the starlit sky
Her hair was dark and it was curly
I’ll miss her till the day I die 
I miss my darling she is sleeping
Underneath the beautiful sky
I miss her now since she has left me
I will miss her til the day I die

‘Neath the shadow in the meadow
Lillies lie on every side
By the river flowers shudder
Fading dying in their prime
Lovers parting lonely crying
Sadly strolling down the lane
Someone saying I must leave you
Til the roses bloom again
   When the roses bloom again
   When the roses bloom again
   I will meet you I will greet you
   When the roses bloom again
Sunshine’s over crimson clover
Blooming in the meadow bright
Summer fingers softly lingers
Whispering softly in the night
Someone roaming in the gloaming
Strolling sadly down the lane
For that promise she would cherish
Til the roses bloom again
She was faithful to her lover
She was true until the end
Though she knew not what befell him
Still she hopes they’ll meet again

In a cold and cheerless garret
In a room so dim so lone
In the frosty winter in silence
There was heard a little mourn
And a little child is asking
At the break of the day
Will the roses bloom in heaven
Tell me momma tell me pray
   
   Will the roses bloom in heaven
   Are there any gardens there
   Any violets and clover
   Way up with the angels there
   
   Will the branches fill with blossoms
   And in winter fill with snow
   Will the roses bloom in heaven
   Tell me momma ere I go
Now the room grows light and lighter
Every thing has caught a glow
Heaven seems to stretch about her
While dreams they just come and go
Then she whispered birds are singing
Songs of melody
And I see the roses blooming
While the angels beckon me
Then mother whispered
In the land so bright and fair
When the roses are blooming
There will be no parting there
Goodbye my little darling
For death is lingering here
And on the little pale face
There was not one trace of fear

I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down
When through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand
Will there be any stars in my crown
   Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
   When at evening the sun goeth down
   When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
   Will there be any stars in my crown
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When His praise like the sea billow rolls
O what joy it will be when His face I behold
Living gems at His feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown

How would you like feeling lonesome
When someone is through with you
My heart is sad and I’m lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
Don’t want you to cry cause I’m leaving
Don’t want you to cry cause I’m blue
Only my thoughts make me lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
Why should two lovers quarrel
Why should they be so untrue
I know what it means to be lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
No one to love me little darling
Nothing but memories of you
When I’m far away I’ll be lonesome
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
Give me your right hand honey
I’ll say this farewell to you
I’ll be so lonesome without you
I wonder if you’re lonesome too
I wonder if you’re lonesome too

Now will you love me little darling
When I’m in some other land?
And you know I can’t be with you
Or will you be loving another man? 
   Will you be loving another man
   Will you be loving another man
   When I return will you be waiting
   Or will you be loving another man
Now don’t be crying on my shoulder
And telling me that love is grand
And before I’m out of sight dear
Then be loving another man
Now if I find this to be true dear
I want you to please understand
When I return don’t say you’re sorry
Just keep on loving another man

We’ve been together for so long
It hurts to know your love is gone
Here’s all my lonely heart can say
Will you be satisfied that way
Will you be satisfied to roam
Will memories fade when you are gone
A new love led your heart astray
Will you be satisfied that way
It’s hard to stay when is cold
So often that this story’s cold
I’m not asking that you pity me
Will you be satisfied that way
Will you be satisfied to know
You left a heart that’s beating low
Somehow somewhere you’ll have to pay
Will you be satisfied that way
Deep down inside I’ll love you yet
I’ve suffered but there’s no regret
Love can’t be bought it must be free
Will you be satisfied that way
Will you be satisfied to roam
Will memories fade when you are gone
A new love led your heart astray
Will you be satisfied that way

When these lips shall never more
Place a kiss upon thy brow
When life hold’s still in death
Will you love me then as now
   Will you miss me (miss me when I’m gone)
   Will you miss me (miss me when I’m gone)
   Will you miss me (miss me when I’m gone)
   Will you miss me when I’m gone
Perhaps you’ll plant some flowers
Round my cold unworthy grave
Come and sit along here beside me
Where the roses nod and wave
On a cold dark Sunday morning
In a land not far away
A little girl from old Kentucky
Lifted up her voice to say

Willie Moore was a king his age twenty-one
And he courted a damsel fair
Oh her eyes were as bright as the diamonds after night
And wavy black was her hair
He courted her both night and day
Till on marry they did agree
But when he came to get her parents’ consent
They said that could never be
She threw herself in Willie Moore’s arms
As oft time had done before
But little did he think when they parted that night
Sweet Anna he would see no more.
Oh it was about the tenth of May
The time I remember well
That very same night her body disappeared
In a way no tongue could tell
Sweet Anna was loved both far and near
Had friends most all around
And in a little brook before the cottage door
The body of sweet Anna was found
She was taken by her weeping friends
And carried to her parent’s room
And there she was dressed in a shroud of snowy white
And laid in a lonely tomb
Her parents now are left alone
One mourns while the other weeps
Beneath a grassy mound before the cottage door
The body of sweet Anna sleeps
Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say
And at last from them all he did part
And the last heard from him he was in Montreal
Where he died of a broken heart

His age is seven years today
He don’t know what it is to play
Each night before he goes to bed
This little prayer he always says
Now I lay me down to rest
Please God please give me happiness
I’m prayin’ so my dreams come true
So I can walk and play with you
His name they call him Willie Roy
He’s just a little crippled boy
But now the tears roll down his cheek
I rub them off so he can sleep
Someday I hope you can go out
And play with me and walk about
I won’t scold you if you should cry
So son be good my son good night

Oh give to me a winding stream
It must not be too wide
Where waving leaves from maple trees
Do meet from either side
The water must be deep enough
To float a small canoe
With no one else but you
   Do not disturb
   My waking dream
   The splendor of
   That winding stream
   Flower in my canoe
   Her eyes they looked me through
   A maiden fair
   With golden hair
   Is very much like you
The sparkling trout
Beneath the bank
Does leave his hiding place
King fisher
From the bow above
So eager to give chase
The spreading branches
Overhead
The sunlight peeking through
When looking dear at you

    Oh, how I’d like to be upon a windy mountain
    Where the tree tops scrape the sky
    Then I would forget all my worries and my troubles
    I’ll just let the wind blow them by
I how I love the sound of the wind when it’s howlin
For it blows my blues away
It makes me forget the girl that I’m lovin
Lets me forget until another day
Let me hear the leaves on the trees when they are singing
Just a moment of relief is all care
For I’ve got no sorrow heartaches or sadness
As long as I can see the trees that sway
Oh, my friends bury me a way up on the mountain
Where that old wind will always blow
For I want to rest alone on the mountain
With the howlin wind that I love so
Tell my old lover in care you should see her
Just how much I love her she’ll never know
And that I’ve gone to rest away upon the mountain
Where the howling wind will always blow

A child was born to be our Savior
Wise men came from near and far
To see the Jesus in the manger
The pathway lighted by the stars 
   Someday he’ll wake me from the dead
   No more I’ll sleep there all alone
   But carried up to Him on high
   On the wings of angels headed home 
They crucified our Lord and Savior
He humbly died there on the cross
That we might someday rise and join Him
Our souls be saved and not be lost

While rovin’ on one winter’s night
And a-drinkin’ good old wine
Thinkin’ about that dear little girl
That broke this heart of mine 
For she is like some budded rose
That blooms in the month of June
She’s like some music instrument
That’s just been enably tuned 
Perhaps a trip to a foreign land
A trip to France or Spain
But if I go ten thousand miles
I’m a-comin’ back again 
And who’s a-gonna shoe your poor little foot
Who will glove your hands
Who will kiss your red ruby lips
And who will be your man
Papas gonna shoe my poor little foot
And mama will glove my hand
You can kiss my red ruby lips
And you can be my man
I love you till the sea runs dry
And the rocks all melt in the sun
I love you till the day I die
Though you will never be my own 
While rovin’ on one winter’s night
And drinkin’ good old wine
Thinkin’ about that dear little girl
That broke this heart of mine
 

The wedding bells chimed for somebody else
I wish they were ringing for me
And though I was hopin’ someday you’d be mine
I guess that it never can be
Wishing wishing never again to be lonely
Waiting praying you know that I love you only so
When you are laughing with somebody else
You know I’ll be cryin’ for you
I may be smilin’ to cover my tears
While waltzing with somebody new
And wishing that someone was you
I’m waltzing with somebody else in my arms
But you’re still the one in my heart
I’m always dreamin’ of our used to be
Wishing we had a new start
I keep on wishing and hoping you’ll find
That I am the right one for you
I may be waltzing with somebody else
But darlin’ I’ll always be true
‘Til I’m wishing and waltzing with you

I feel the shadows now upon me
And the angels beckon to me
Before I go dear sisters and brothers
Won’t you come and sing for me
   Sing those hymns we sang together
   In that plain little church with the benches all worn
   How dear to my heart how precious the moments
   We stood shaking hands and singing a song
My burden is heavy my way has grown weary
I have traveled a road that is long
And it would warm this old heart my dear brother
If you come and sing me one song
In my home beyond the dark river
Your sweet faces no more I will see
Until we meet where there’s no more sad parting
Won’t you come and sing for me

I’m waiting watching and longing
That beautiful sight to behold
When I shall awake some bright morning
In that city with streets of pure gold
My savior has gone to prepare it
For all who accept his grace
And that’s why I know I’ll be welcome
To a home in that wonderful place
   When I reach my home in that city
   Shall I find you waiting up there
   With the saints who have gone on before us
   To that beautiful home so fair
   My whole heart is set upon heaven
   Where my savior’s face I shall see
   And live in the light of his glory
   Throughout all eternity
Yodel
He bids us to work in His vineyard
To toil for Him early and late
What a glorious reward for our labor
To enter that beautiful gate

   It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
   It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
   It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
   I’m worried now but I won’t be worried long 
I went across the river and I laid down to sleep
I went across the river and I laid down to sleep
I went across the river and I laid down to sleep
When I woke up, there were shackles on my feet 
Twenty one links of chain around my leg
Twenty one links of chain around my leg
Twenty one links of chain around my leg
And on each link, the initials of my name 
I asked the judge what’s gonna be my fine
I asked the judge what’s gonna be my fine
I asked the judge what’s gonna be my fine
Twenty one years on the Rocky Mountain Line 
If anyone should ask you who composed this song
If anyone should ask you who composed this song
If anyone should ask you who composed this song
Say it was me and I sing it all day long

I wouldn’t change a single thing about you if I could
The way you are just suits me to a tee
A princess in a story book a King upon his throne
That’s what we are and you belong to me
I wouldn’t change you if I could I love you as you are
You’re all that I would wish for if I wished upon a star
An angel sent from heaven you’re everything that’s good
You’re perfect just the way you are
I wouldn’t change you if I could
Your eyes your lips your tehder smile I’d leave them as they are
And come what may I’d never change a thing
And if I were a potter and you a piece of clay
The only thing I’d change would be your name

Along came the FFV, the fastest on the line,
Running along the C and O Road, twenty minutes behind the time
Running into Sewall Yard, was quartered on the line
Awaiting their strict orders to bring her in on time
And when she blew for Hinton, her engineer was there
George Alley was his name, with bright and wavy hair
His fireman, Jack Dickerson, was standing by his side
Receiving their strict orders, and in the cab to ride
George Alley’s mother came to him with a basket on her arm
She handed him a letter saying “Be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life trying to make up lost time
But if you run your engine right you’ll get there just on time”
George Alley said, “Dear mother, your letter I’ll take heed
I know my engine is all right and I know that she will speed
So o’er this road I mean to run with speed unknown to all
And when I blow for Clifton Forge, they’ll surely hear my call
George Alley said to his fireman, “Jack, a little extra steam;
I intend to run old Number 4 the fastest ever seen;
So o’er this road I mean to fly like angels’ wings unfurled,
And when I blow for the Big Bend Tunnel, they’ll surely hear my call”
George Alley said to his fireman, “Jack, a rock ahead I see,
And I know that death is lurking there for to grab both you and me
So from this cab, dear Jack do fly, your darling life to save
For I want you to be an engineer while I’m sleeping in my grave”
“Oh no, dear George! That will not do, I want to die with you”
“Oh no, dear Jack, that will not be; I’ll die for you and me”
So from the cab poor Jack did leap, New River was running high,
And he kissed his hand to George as Number 4 flew by
So up the road she dashed, against the rock she crashed
The engine turning upside down, and the coaches coming last
George Alley’s head in the firebox lay, while the burning flames rolled high
“I’m glad I was born an engineer, on the C and O road to die”
George Alley’s mother came to him and in sorrow she did sigh
When she looked upon her darling boy and saw that he must die
“Too late, too late, dear mother! my doom is almost o’er
And I know that God will let me in when I reach that golden shore”
The doctor said, “Dear George, O darling boy, be still
Your life may yet be spared, if it is God’s blessed will”
“Oh no, dear doc, that cannot be, I want to die so free
I want to die on the engine I love, 143″
The doctor said, “Dear George, your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad, and laid in a lonesome grave”
His face was covered up with blood, his eyes they could not see
And the very last words that ever he spoke were, “Nearer my God to Thee”

Well, they gave him his orders in Monroe, Virginia
Saying Steve you are way behind time
This is not thirty eight, but it’s old ninety seven
You must put her into Spencer on time
He turned and said to his tired greasy fireman
Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross the White Oak Mountain
You can watch old Ninety-Seven roll
It’s a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
On a line on a three mile grade
It was on this grade that he lost his leverage
You can see what a jump he made
He was going down the grade making ninety miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
They found him in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
He was scalded to death by the steam
Now all you ladies you must take warning
From this time now on learn
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband
He may leave you and never return

Who did you say it was brother
Who was it fell by the way
When whiskey and blood run together
Did you hear anyone pray
I didn’t hear nobody pray, dear brother
I didn’t hear nobody pray
I heard the crash on the highway
But I didn’t hear nobody pray
When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stamped on my heart
There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn’t hear nobody pray
I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody’s life is now through
Their soul has been called by the Master
They died in a crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying
But, I didn’t hear nobody pray

I can’t seem to learn not to love you
You get to me every time
You’re someone I just can’t say no to
And you’re so good at changin’ my mind
    Here I go down that wrong road again
    Goin’ back where I’ve already been
    Even though I know where it will end
    Here I go down that wrong road again
Though I see the web that you’re weavin’
You and your soft easy lies
Before I stop to think, I’m believin’
And I’m fallin’ for you one more time

   You are my flower
   That’s blooming in the mountain so high
   You are my flower
   That’s blooming there for me
When summertime is gone and snow begins to fall
You can sing this song and say to one and all
So wear a happy smile and life will be worthwhile
Forget the tears but don’t forget to smile

Beyond the night dear as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I woke dear I was mistaken
And I hung my head and I cried
   You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
   You make me happy when skies are gray
   You’ll never know dear how much I love you
   Please don’t take my sunshine away
I’ll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You’ll regret it all someday
You told me once dear you really loved me
And no one could come between
But now you’ve left me to love another
You have shattered all my dreams
In all my dreams dear you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So won’t you come back and make me happy
I’ll forgive dear I’ll take all the blame

Just let me tell you how a liar will do
He’s always coming with something new
He’ll steal your heart with false pretence
Making out like he’s your bosom friend
   
   If you don’t want to get in trouble
   If you don’t want to get in trouble
   If you don’t want to get in trouble
   Better let that liar alone
When a liar takes the notion to bend the truth
He’ll lay around his neighbors and get the news
And nearly every day when you look out
You can see that liar coming to your house
He’ll tell you such a lie it’ll surprise your mind
He’ll mix a little truth for to make it shine
When he gets his business fixed just right
Then that liar’s going to cause a fight
He studies up a lie he’ll tell it so smooth
You’ll think absolutely that it must be true
And he’ll urge you out for to trace the tale
And if you don’t mind you’ll be put in jail
When everything’s in perfect peace
Then comes that liar with his deceit
A hypocrite liar both keeps up a fuss
They’re both very bad but a liar’s the worse

Today I’m alone and thinking of you
For you said we’d never part
But you done gone away and left me
Left me with a broken heart
You promised to love me forever
And to me you would always be the same
But darling you broke your promise
And now I know your little game
My heart’s still crying for you darling
For it knows I love you true
And some day in the future darling
Your heart may be crying too
I hope my dear you’ll be happy
And never be alone and blue
For I still love you darling
Though you left me here so blue

You can have her I don’t want her
She didn’t love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay
The girl I loved she up and left me
She run away with my best friend
She comes in around midnight
And then I come she’s gone again
Well if you’re in love with the wrong woman
There’s only one thing that you can do
Just dig a hole and jump right in it
Then pull the ground in over you
Now life is mighty empty
Without love to call you own
I’d rather have love that I can cling to
That to has the world and all it’s gold

Oh you can’t do wrong and get by
No matter how hard you may try
So just do what you please and try to feel at ease
For you can’t do wrong and get by
No hypocrite can do wrong and get by
No matter how hard you may try
Salvation you say you’ve got but God knows you’ve not
So you can’t do wrong and get by
No liar can do wrong and get by
No matter how hard you may try
For when you have to die you can’t tell a single lie
And you can’t do wrong and get by
No drunkard can do wrong and get by
No matter how hard you may try
When you get so many drinks you may get by you think
But you can’t do wrong and get by

I gave you every chance to be true
But it seems like that’s too much for you
I took you back when you were running around
When you promised me you’d settle down
You’re just the kind that could never be true
You break my heart with everything that you do
It’s better that I should even start again
With you sweet heart I know I can’t win
There’s just no use trying to live with you
There’s something wrong you’ll never be true
You tear me up with your rambling ways
Then you come back and say you’re home to stay

That was the day when you went away
You broke my heart in the month of may
That little ring I gave to you
Was to show you dear my love was true
Sweet are the flowers of our friendship
That has bloomed our whole life through
But n’er forget though you’re far away
They’re blooming in my heart today
You denied your love but you proved it so
You came to see me when the sun was low
You broke my heart but you were kind
When you said oh dear you’ll never be mine
Oh let me tell you what love will do
If you love a boy that don’t love you
They’ll break your heart they’ll leave you alone
They’ll roam the west so far from home

   You don’t have to move that mountain
   Just help me Lord to climb it
   You don’t have to move that stumbling block
   Just show me the way around it
We must climb a great high mountain
To reach Gold’s gracious kingdom
In His words you’ll find the strength
If you will just believe them
Well the way is filled with pitfalls
And sometimes we may falter
You can have His grace my friend
On your knees down at the altar

In the beginning you really loved me
But I was blind and I could not see
But when you left me oh how I cried
You don’t miss your water ’til your well runs dry.
I was a playboy I could not be true
I could not believe I really loved you
But when you left me oh how I cried
You don’t miss your water ’til your well runs dry.
In the beginning you really loved me
But I was blind and I could not see
But when you left me oh how I cried
You don’t miss your water ’til your well runs dry.
I was a playboy I could not be true
I could not believe I really loved you
But when you left me oh how I cried
You don’t miss your water ’til your well runs dry.

Well you tell me that you care
But now you’re gone, you’ve got me cryin’
No use denyin’ you done me wrong
If I could look inside your heart
Maybe I would know the reason
Why you are leavin’ me all alone. 
   Well you know it’s not so
   When you said you tried
   Well, you know you lied
   I didn’t do one wrong thing to you
   Won’t you tell me baby why
   You went and left me here so lonely
   I miss you only for I love you. 
 Did I ever make you sad
So you’d be mad enough to hurt me
And desert me for so long?
Well you’re tellin’ everyone what you done
You think it’s funny
Well, listen honey you done me wrong.

Two lovers sat in a quiet little place
Two lovers seated in one fond embrace
Whispering softly these words so divine
You give me your love and I’ll give you mine
Tell me your love me and say you’ll be true
I’ll love nobody in this world like you
Your heart and my heart in love will entwine
You give me your love and I’ll give you mine
I’ve something to ask you while you’re by my side
A question of love a groom and a bride
And if you refuse me my heart it will pine
You give me your love and I’ll give you mine

You go to your church and I’ll go to mine
But let’s walk along together
Our fathers built them side by side
So let’s walk along together
   The road is rough and the way is long
   But we’ll help each other over
   You go to your church and I’ll go to mine
   But let’s walk along together
You go to your church and I’ll go to mine
But let’s walk along together
Our Heavenly Father is the same
So let’s walk along together
The Lord will be at your church today
But he’ll be at my church also
You go to your church and I’ll go to mine
But let’s walk along together

I just got a call from my good girl today
Said she must be going on her way
There’s better things on down the line
And I’ll not try to change her mind
She seems to think we’re better off this way
   But my heart it breaks in two
   I can’t believe that it’s true
   Though I want you to stay you’re leaving anyway
   You gotta do what you gotta do
There’s times that I know I’ve not been there for you
Maybe that’s the reason for your leaving
I’ll try to keep you off my mind
’cause a girl like you is hard to find
Somehow I’ll just have to stop my grieving
I guess it would be better if I’d never known your love
Then I wouldn’t know just what I’m missing
But I’ve seen that look in your eye and now it comes as no surprise
That another’s lips soon you will be kissing

Lord lordy me, and it’s lord lordy my
Oh honey you lead me to the wrong
Some people born with silver and gold
Others have husbands and wifes
I never had a thing in this whole wide wicked world
Now I’m losing my life
Now I’m losing my life
You promised me that we would be wed
On this I’d lay my money down
You were seen courtin my best freind
You caused me to shoot him down
You caused me to shoot him down
Well love of a woman is bitter but sweet
Even though she turns him down
The price I have to pay may come to you someday
And you’ll in the sea of sorrow drown
And you’ll in the sea of sorrow drown
Well they say I have a rightto my very last few words
Before they let the scaffold down
A man has to fight for what he thinks is right
Even if it puts him in the ground
Even if it puts him in the ground
Now it’s gonna put me in the ground
Lord Lordy me, and it’s Lord Lordy my
Oh honey you lead me to the wrong

My dear you’ve been gone for such a long time
You know you have driven me out of my mind
You left me alone and went on your way
And my broken heart the price it must pay
The sigh of the wind the beat of the rain
Bring back to my heart this feeling of pain
I’ve tried to forget but it never will be
For my broken heart just won’t set me free
When I close my eyes or look into space
I see not the dark but your smilin’ face
Wherever I go whatever I say
My poor achin’ heart will have its way
Well time must go on til my heart is still
Til that very day I’ll follow your will
The pain will not die for it must live on
And I can’t forget you left me alone
 

You tied a love knot in my heart dear
When you said you’d be my bride
Oh how well I remember
As we strolled side by side
Leaves were falling all around us
Roses withered on the ground
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
That can never be unwound
The only thing that I have left now
Is this little string I’ve found
With a little love knot in it
That she held tight in her hand
As I stood there by your bedside
As I looked into your eyes
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
That can never be untied
There’s a heart tonight that’s lonely
There’s a heart tonight that’s sad
For God has took you from me
The best pal I ever had
She’s gone to sing up in heaven
God needed her there by His side
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
That can never be untied

I tried to tell you how I loved you
And I tried to tell you night and day
But when I’m gone no more to see you
Honey you won’t be satisfied that way
I’ll leave you now if you don’t want me
I’ll leave you anytime you say
But when I’m gone no more to see you
Honey you won’t be satisfied that way

   You’d better get right little darling
   And quit all this running round
   You’d better get right little darling
   I’m gonna tear your playhouse down
You told me once there was no other
But now you’ve gone far away
I’ll always think of you my darling
And pray we’ll meet again some day
Many nights I wait for you love
While your painting up the town
Now if your gonna keep on cheating
I’m gonna tear your playhouse down

Eight weeks ago the night we parted
My blue skies now have turned to grey
Alone I hang my head in sorrow
No other love can take your place
You’ll always be my blue eyed darlin’
I’ll always love you as today
But when you left me for another
You broke my heart a million ways
It makes no difference where you wander
It makes no difference where you stray
You’ll always be my blue eyed darlin’
No other love could take your place

No more no more she’ll walk this earth
Her face like a beautiful flower
But all alone there’s a marble stone
You’ll find her name written there
A new voice rings where the angel sings
A voice so pure and so fair
But if you look in the heavenly book
You’ll find her name written there
I’m all alone since the dawn of fate
Left me in the deepest despair
But if you wait at the pearly gates
You’ll find her name written there
I breathe her name into the air
It goes and I know not where
But if you look to the heart of a friend
You’ll find her name written there
 

As you go from me you want all that’s left
The last thread of pride in my heart
‘Til you’ve wrung the last teardrop from my eye
You won’t be satisfied.
   So take your cold unloving heart
   Your eyes too blinded to see
   You’ve never found the door to this heart of mine
   You’ll get no more of me.
You wrecked my heart like a cruel winter storm
Bending my branches so low
Oh your wayward heart and your tortured soul
Leave no memory worthy to hold.
So I’ll take back my heart from the willow bough
I’ll hang my tears out to dry
I’ll hang my head in sorrow no more
And no more tears will I cry.

In the deep dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That’s the place where I trace my bloodline
And it’s there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive
Oh my granddad’s dad walked down Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said won’t you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we’ll never leave Harlan alive
    Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
    And the sun goes down about three in the day
    And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinking
    And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away
No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
‘Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills he said I’ll pay ya for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig laughed and sang a new song
Who said we’d never leave Harlan alive
But the times got hard and tobacco wasn’t selling
And ole granddad knew what he’d do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

On one evening long ago when the sun was sinkin’ low
My true lover went to sail upon the sea
It was in the month of June when the roses were in bloom
That he took me in his arms and said to me
   You’re a flower bloomin’ in the wildwood
   A flower bloomin’ there for me
   Freer than the morning dew but I’ll soon return to you
   You’re a flower that is bloomin’ there for me
Then this message came to me from the captain on the sea
And it told me that my darling was dead
Oh this shocking words surprise brought the teardrops to my eyes
When I thought about the last words that I said
Now he can’t return to me he got drowned in the sea
And he’s past o’r life’s weary waves
When it’s in the month of June and the roses are in bloom
Oh it seems that I can hear my darling say
Del McCoury; I Wonder Where You Are Tonight

All your life you’ve lived a sinner the bright way you’ve never trod
You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven’t met with God
You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
   You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
   On down the dark river I’m sorry to say
   You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
   Don’t wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won’t give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
You can hear Jesus callin’ and you won’t accept His hand
You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
When you come to the river Jesus don’t give thee command
You’re drifting away you’re drifting away
And the dark rollin’ river takes you to the sinkin’ sand
You’re drifting away you’re drifting away

You told me once dear I was true and kind
You told me then love that you were mine
But now you tell me that you were blind
You like your parties and good times
I’m sorry darlin cause you feel this way
But you told me truthful to my face
You found another to take my place
All dressed in diamonds pearls and lace
   I’m sorry darlin cause you let me down
   A truer love now you think you’ve found
   But when I’m laid deep down in the ground
   You’re gonna be sorry you let me down
So now I’ve lost you but I still have faith
That you will see the mistake you made
And when you find dear that you are wrong
You’ll ask forgiveness and come back home
I believed you darlin when you said to me
That we’d be happy that we’d be free
But now I’ve found dear a fault in thee
When we were wed love I could not see

You’re just what the doctor told me I was needing ( oh Doctor )
And I know he was right from the start
When I hold you close and kiss you I’m in heaven
You’re just what the Doctor ordered for my broken heart
Not so long ago I thought I was in love
But now I know it wasn’t meant to be ( meant to be )
The moment I met you my skies of gray turned to blue
And the tears I’ve shed are just a memory ( memory )
You’re just what the doctor told me I was needing ( oh Doctor )
When he took my pulse and looked down at his chart
You’re a lot sweeter than the one I shed those tears for
You’re just what the Doctor ordered for my broken heart
I thought I’d found my love but she fed me poison love
And now I’m glad you’ve gone and set me free ( set me free )
And now that you are mine the world is rolling fine
And the blues I knew is just a memory ( memory )

We are saying goodbye dear forever
I am leaving your false love behind
Every promise you made has been broken
You’re no longer a sweetheart of mine
I wanted someone true and faithful
And that is the way it had to be
You wanted your honky-tonk life dear
You’re no longer a sweetheart to me
   Go back to the bar down the street dear
   And stay with your honky-tonk kind
   Go back to the life you’ve been living
   You’re no longer a sweetheart of mine
From a bottle to a ride in the moonlight
In the arms of the first man you see
Another victim added to your list dear
You’re no longer a sweetheart to me
I could never pretend to be happy
Until a true love I have found
But you lived a lie from the start dear
You’re no longer a sweetheart of mine

I make all the honky tonks and taverns
Just to see who’s hanging ’round
Tryin’ to drown away all my sorrows
Cause my darlin’ let me down 
   Oh I could get someone to love me
   And I could get someone to care
   But when I need someone to true love me
   You’re not easy to forget. 
Last night while dancin’ with my new love
And gazin’ into her eyes of blue
I knew that I could have loved her
If I never dated you.

Tonight we part forever
You’re nothing more to me
The chain that bound us is broken
Not a tear I’ll shed for thee
So break the heart of another
Just as you have broken mine
Go tell her that you love her
And call her fondly thine
Here take this ring you gave me
It was so dear to me
So give it to another
It’s nothing more to me
When you gaze upon the engraving
Will you think one time of me
You’ve broken my heart forever
Not a tear I’ll shed for thee
Goodnight goodbye forever
You’re nothing more to me
You’ve broken my heart forever
Not a tear I’ll shed for thee
I must say goodbye my darling
Nevermore to meet again
I will ask of you a promise
Will you meet me up in heaven

Oh a long time ago when I left my old home
I thought my darlin’ I’d leave you behind
But as time lingers on I can’t go it alone
But darlin’ somehow you’re still on my mind
Each night I’m so lonely thinkin of you
I wonder sweetheart if you feel the same
I’m on my way back to start lovin’ you
For often in dreams love I call your name
I’ve heard lots of things since I’ve been gone
But I never thought that you was unkind
Well you’d take me back just as before
But darlin’ somehow you’re still on my mind
Someday when we’re old and weary of life
Our time is no longer we’ll have to part
We’ll meet up in heaven just as before
Up there with God I’ll call you sweetheart

Now you’re the best of all the leading brands
From loving kisses down to holding hands
I am happy only in your company
And no one else can make this guarantee
   You’re the best and always number one
   You’ve got the competition of the run
   I’m sure that everybody understands
   I like you best of all the leading brands
Your new improved performance sure is great
To me there is no question how you rate
Your quality puts you so far ahead
Your shape your style your looks sure knocks ’em dead

Oh I first met you down in lover’s lane
You were just like an angel my little blue-eyed Jane
We walked along we sang a song, the birds were singing too
Would be like Heaven here on earth to be again with you
   For you’re the girl of my dreams
   But it seems that my dreams will never come true
At night we’d sit out in the old porch swing
The stars were shining brightly while softly you would sing
You sang of happy days gone by, you made me happy too
Would be like Heaven here on earth to be again with you

My bark of life was drifting  down the troubled stream of time
When first I saw your smiling face and youth was in its prime 
   Oh I’ll never forget you wherever I roam wherever you may be
   If ever I have had a friend you’ve been that friend to me 
Misfortune nursed me as a child and loved me fondly too
I would have had a broken heart had it not have been for you 
I now look back upon the past across life’s troubled sea
And smile to think thru all I’ve seen you’ve been a friend to me

I don’t want you mean momma
There aint no use you hanging around
For I’ve found me another momma
And now I am Chicago bound
   You’ve been fooling me baby
   You’ve been telling me your lies
   When I thought you were an angel
   Just sent down from the skies
Sing those parting blues to me sweet Nell
When you leave you leave me sad
Cause my daddy’s gone and left me
I just wouldn’t treat him right
I wouldn’t give him much lovin
I wouldn’t stay home at night
Now I hear the train a comin
He has gone out of site

My spark of life was spinning down the troubled seas of time
When first I saw your smiling face and youth was in its prime 
   Oh I’ll never forget you wherever I roam wherever you may be
   If ever I have had a friend you’ve been that friend to me 
Misfortune nursed me as her child and loved me fondly too
I would have had a broken heart had it not have been for you 
I now look back upon the past across life’s troubled sea
And smile to think thru all I’ve seen you’ve been a friend to me

Lord why did I have to see you
I should have looked the other way
I thought that I could love and leave you
I should’ve known I’d have to pay
   You’ve Got the Look of a Perfect Diamond
   And your heart is hard as stone
   You think of love as just a playhouse
   A place to play then move on
Before I met you life was easy
Nothin’ was standin’ in my way
Why can’t I block you from my memory
Erase your image now today
Each day is misery and confusion
Looks like troubles here to stay
Oh I bet it’s not the first time
That you’ve tortured hearts this way

   You’ve got to righten that wrong someday
   Years may pass but you cant get away
   If you do wrong today the price you must pay
   You’ve got to righten that wrong someday
Do not lie or gossip on the folks whom you know
But do good to all while you may
Did smile while their face and frown when they go
You’ve got to righten that wrong someday
You hear Jesus pleading to come to the fold
The time is fleeting away
He will strengthen your spirits and sweeten your soul
Why not righten these wrongs today

Amid the Blue Ridge Mountains
There lived a maiden fair
Whose life was pure as heaven
Whose life was free from care
She dreamed of love and romance
With heart so glad and free
No gloom within the future
Young Freda Bolt could see
Nearby lived dear young Harmon
A boy she loved so well
And of these two young lovers
A story I will tell
Twas late one Thursday evening
The stars were shinning dim
That dear one called his sweetheart
To come and go with him
He told her on tomorrow
That they would surely wed
But little was she thinking
He’d take her life instead
They motored to Clinch Mountain
A place so dark and lone
And there her form so helpless
He placed beneath the stones
Away from home and mother
That Freda loved so well
The bitter pain and anguish
No mortal tongue can tell
Through tears she pled for mercy
Though he denied her cry
Young Harmon left his sweetheart
In agony to die
We think that God in heaven
Must surely heard her cry
And sent a band of angels
To linger very nigh
And bare her spirit over
To yonder happy shore
Where dying comes no never
And parting is no more

I have waited long in silence while you realize your dreams
But you take and take and take love, never turn a hand to me
Like a teardrop in an ocean, grain of sand upon a beach
I could journey on forever to a heart that’s out of reach.
   Oh, what more can I give you that I’ve not already given
   I have only one heart, one life to live
   You take what I’m a-wanting, I’m mindful of your greed
   My lifetime is too short to give you all that you need.
    The walls of love are tumbled ’round me left me standing by myself

God’s given us years of happiness here
Now we must part
And as the angels come and call for you
The pangs of grief tug at my heart
   Oh my darling my darling
   My heart breaks as you take
   Your lone journey
Oh the days will be empty the nights so long
Without you my love
And as God calls for you I’m left alone
But we will meet in heaven above
Fond memories I’ll keep of the happy days
That on earth we trod
And when I come we will walk hand in hand
As one in heaven in the family of God

The rose that I planted with such tender care
Is wilted and fading today
I’ll cherish the blossom that once was so fair
Like your love that’s gone far away. 
 It seems so unfair and hard to believe
That you took my dreams and were gone
Your reason for leavin’ my heart can’t conceive
But the tears have convinced me you’re gone 
 I stand all alone with a rose in my hand
Although it is withered and old
It’s all I have left with this faded gold band
And a memory I could never let go. 
 So dear if you’re mine give a thought to the past
Don’t worry for love comes and goes
My love for you was made, dear, to last
Your love bloomed and died like the rose
Your love bloomed and died like the rose.

It was long, long ago in the moonlight
We were sitting on the banks of the stream
When you whispered so sweetly, I love you
As the waters murmured a tune
   Oh they tell me your love is like a flower
   In the springtime blossoms so fair
   In the fall then they wither away dear
   And they tell me that’s the way of your love
I remember the night, little darling
We were talking of days gone by
When you told me you always would love me
That for me your love would never die
It was spring when you whispered these words dear
The flowers were all blooming so fair
But today as the snow falls around us
I can see that your love is not there

The night was dark and stormy
The wind was howling wild
As an aged mother gazed upon
The portrait of her child
As she gazed on the baby’s features
That once filled her heart with joy
He’s now in this wild world roaming
That mother’s long lost boy
   Your mother still prays for you, Jack
   Your mother still prays for you
   In a home far over the ocean
   Your mother still prays for you
At last there came a letter
It was deeply edged in black
From a comrade long forgotten
Who still remembered Jack
They have lain your dear old mother
In a grave so dark and cold
And she wants her boy who is roaming
To meet her on the streets of gold
His stony heart was broken
As he thought of his mother dear
And in spite of his comrades laughing
He could not keep back his tears
In spite of the great temptations
That once filled his heart with tears
So he started for Heaven that evening
As sweetly the people did sing

I’m going away to stay awhile
Just to ease my worried mind
You never cared for me my love
So I’m leaving you behind
   It’s been this way so long my dear
   Why can’t you understand
   Your selfish heart broke up our home
   Just for another man
I tried to live my life alone
All through these lonely years
I keep your picture here with me
Just to dry these bitter tears

People keep asking and wondering why
There’s always a tear in your eye
You’ve lived a hard life one I’d rather not lead
I ought to be glad it’s not me
   But when tears fill your eyes and clouds hide the sky
   Your heart is so sad and you have a worried mind
   You’ll know my heart is with you and my love for you ain’t blind
   Your worries and troubles are mine
Now the nights are hard to get through as I wait restlessly
My letters are written in vain
Unsure of your feelings my tears fall endlessly
And my heart’s beating rhythm with the rain

You’re leaving me for the last time
Love to you was just a past time
I’ll always love you even though it’s wrong
I’ll be better off without when I know you’re gone
You say you must see him once again
To make sure that you’ve made up your mind
You’re expecting me to understand
Even though it will break my heart
You’re leaving me for the last time
Love to you was just a past time
I’ll always love you even though it’s wrong
I’ll be better off without when I know you’re gone

You’re running wild
How long can this go on
You’re leaving me alone
And running wild
You’re always gone
My love you never share
It’s more than I can bear
You’re running wild
   You’ll settle down someday
   And find I’ve gone away
   You’ll think of what you’ve done
   While running wild
I can’t go on
You’ll have to choose the way
You’ll have to go or stay
Stop running wild
You’re running wild

There awaits for me a glad tomorrow
Where the gates of pearl swing open wide
And when I have passed this spell of sorrow
I will camp upon the other side
   Someday beyond the reach of mortal kin
   Someday God only knows just where or when
   The wills of mortal life will all stand still
   And I shall go dwell on Zion’s Hill
Someday the storm clouds will be lifted
Beyond the shadow of the tomb
And with all the bells of Heaven ringing
And the angels singing “Home Sweet Home”

Let me tell you why I feel so sadIt’s all because of the wife I’ve hadAn untimely death has come to meLeft me too lame to walk too blind to see
In a quiet grave on a green hillsideMy love is gone my love has diedMy wedding band I’ll put with youOh how I wish I were with you too
What’s a man to do with a broken heartNowhere to go no place to startI search and search but all I findIs a tormented soul and a worried mind

Way down in the state of GeorgiaThrough the swamps and evergladesThere’s a hole in Tiger MountainGod help the man who gets lost in Miller’s Cave
I had a girl in Waycross GeorgiaBut she had unfaithful waysShe made me feel I was unwantedLike the bats and the bears in Miller’s CaveI couldn’t stand the way she did meI could take her lowdown waysBefore I stay with a cheatin’ womanI’ll go live with the bears in Miller’s CaveI caught her out one Sunday morningWith a man they call Big DaveThe meanest man in Waycross GeorgiaI’d rather fight a mountain lion in Miller’s Cave
I said you’ll pay both you and DaveyI’m gonna see you in your graveThey laughed at me and then I shot themI took their cheating scheming bones to Miller’s Cave
That woman made me feel unwantedBut I showed her I was braveThe most wanted man in the state of GeorgiaBut they’ll never find me ’cause I’m lost in Miller’s Cave

The crew upon this ship are sailingIs deafened by the ocean’s roarThey are tossed by the mighty breakersToward the rocks upon the shore
 Jesus savior be our captain And guide us through this awful storm And help to save each drowning sailor Who has tumbled overboard
This world is like a grand old oceanThe church is like a ship at seaWe are helpless little sailorsLord we’re helpless but for thee

 Lost lost lost Lost in this world without you Lost lost lost Lost in this world without you
Since you turned me down all I do is ramble roundAnd I don’t care what happens to meMy heart was young and gay till the day you went awayNow life here means nothing to me
The words you said to me still haunts my memoryIt seems they’re on my mind both day and nightThe lies that you told torture my weary soulLove is blind I guess I couldn’t see

Who did you say it was brother
Who was it fell by the way
When whiskey and blood run together
Did you hear anyone pray
I didn’t hear nobody pray, dear brother
I didn’t hear nobody pray
I heard the crash on the highway
But I didn’t hear nobody pray
When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stamped on my heart
There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn’t hear nobody pray
I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody’s life is now through
Their soul has been called by the Master
They died in a crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying
But, I didn’t hear nobody pray

The court room the judge waited there
My mother was crying when I left my chair
The sentence were sharp for it cut like a knife
For ninety nine years folks is almost for life
I dreamed of the whistle I heard the bells ring
My sweetheart was coming some good news to bring
I knew that she loved me and that she’d be true
She said she would save me I’m guilty as you
She went for a pardon or else for parole
I know she’ll come back for she’s part of my soul
If she ever fails me I’ll be mighty blue
I’ll stay in this jailhouse I’ll die in here too
They said I was a criminal and to my despair
They sent me to Nashville and shaved off my hair
So come hear my story I’ll tell you my fate
I’m serving in Nashville for another man’s hate
I just got a letter from Nashville town
And after I read it my spirit broke down
It’s sad that my sweetheart and the judge would be wed
And here in this jailhouse I wish I was dead
No matter how right folks a man he may be
Bad company will send him to prison like me
So take a good woman and make her your wife
For ninety nine years folks is almost for life

You’re leaving me for the last time
Love to you was just a past time
I’ll always love you even though it’s wrong
I’ll be better off without when I know you’re gone
You say you must see him once again
To make sure that you’ve made up your mind
You’re expecting me to understand
Even though it will break my heart
You’re leaving me for the last time
Love to you was just a past time
I’ll always love you even though it’s wrong
I’ll be better off without when I know you’re gone

Well you said you wouldn’t leave me ’cause you didn’t want to grieve me
And you couldn’t stand to see tears in my eyes
But you said you loved another and it ain’t like he’s your brother
So I guess it’s time for me to realize
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
Well I think that I’ll surrender you keep looking out the windows
And it’s plain that you don’t love me any way
All you do is walk and piddle while I’m playing second fiddle
I don’t think that I can stand another day
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
For a long time I’ve been knowin’ in your eyes it’s all been showin’
And I knew some day someone would take my place
These cold kisses you’ve been givin’ and the way that we’ve been livin’
There’s enough to make a man start turning grey
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t braggin’
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the wagon

Some day when my last line is written
Some day when I’ve drawn my last breath
When my last words on earth have been spoken
And my lips are sealed in death
Don’t look on my cold form in pity
Don’t think of me as one dead
It’ll just be the house I once lived in
My spirit, by then, will have fled
I’ll have finished my time here allotted
But I won’t be in darkness alone
I will have heard from Heaven
The summons to come on home
And when my body is in the grave
Don’t think that I’ll be there
I won’t be dead, but living
In the place Jesus went to prepare
And after all is said and done
Know that my last earnest prayer
Is that my loved ones be ready
Someday to meet me thereBl

Soon one morning death came creeping in my room
Soon one morning death came creeping in my room
Soon one morning death came creeping in my room
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
Death’s done come and took my Mother away
Death’s done come and took my Mother away
Death’s done come and took my Mother away
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
Death’s done come and took my Father away
Death’s done come and took my Father away
Death’s done come and took my Father away
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
Ride on, Death ’cause you can’t do me no harm
Ride on, Death ’cause you can’t do me no harm
Ride on, Death ’cause you can’t do me no harm
Oh my Lord what shall I do (I do)
People keep asking and wondering why
There's always a tear in your eye
You've lived a hard life one I'd rather not lead
I ought to be glad it's not me

    But when tears fill your eyes and clouds hide the sky
    Your heart is so sad and you have a worried mind
    You'll know my heart is with you and my love for you ain't blind
    Your worries and troubles are mine

Now the nights are hard to get through as I wake restlessly
My letters are written in vain
Unsure of your fellins my tears fall endlessly
And my heart's beating rhythm with the rainYou've heardof interest all your life
If you borrow you must pay
Now the note is bue, I'm asking you
Before you go away
You borrowed all the love I had
In return dear you gave none
Now the tears you are shadding
Are just interest on the loan

    Now you could cry till the end of time
    I wouldn't change my mind
    An account like yours is very bad
    And baby, I'm not blind
    You could cry and plead, get on your kness
    Nortage everything you own
    But the tears you are shedding
    Are just interesting on the loan

If you had made one payment dear
It wouldn't be so bad
The payment dear was for my heart
And all the love I had
You'll pay the price the hard way dear
As you go on alone
But the tears you are shedding
Are just interest on the loanYou never call me darling
You never call me dear
I wonder if you'll miss me when I die
You show no consideration
You have no sympathy
I'm nothing more
Than just your old standby

If you would call me darling
If you would call me dear
If you would learn to love me by and by
I wouldn't mind this waiting 
And I could stand the pain
I'd be something more
Than just your old standby

A shoulder to cry on
Is all you want from me
Someone to share your heartaches
When you cry
Someone you can depend on
Who'll always be around
But I'm nothing more than
Just your old standbyNow I'm just a simple guy, not very smart you see
I never got much learning, never won a spelling bee
But I've always yearned for the big bright lights and to be a big star on broadway
And I made up my mind a long time ago that I'd be right there someday
Oh, they said I couln't do it, but I did it
And I said to myself, I said self
Your mama didn't raise no idiot

I remember when I'se in my teens I used to work the farm
I plowed a mule from dawn til dark, never done nobody no harm
Then one weekend the mule got stuborn when I wanted to ride him to town
My daddy said son, you wanta get his attention, why don't you knock him down
Pap didn't think I'd do it but I did it
And I said to myself, I said self
Your mama didn't raise no idiot

Then later on I bought a car, my troubles really begin
I guss I've spent a million bucks and traded a thousand time since then
A real smart man then put me wise, since then my life's been gay
He said open a used car lot and driver a different one every day
He didn't think I'd do it, but I did it
And I said to myself, I said self
Your mama didn't raise no idiotIt was long, long ago in the moonlight
We were sitting on the banks of the stream
When you whispered so sweetly, I love you
And the flowers murmured a tune

On they tell me your love's like a flower
In the spring time it blossoms so fair
In the cold wind it withers away dear
And theytell me that't the way of your love

I remember the night, little darling
We were talking of days gone by
When you told me you always would love me
And your love for me would never die

It was spring you told me those words, dear
The flowers were blooming so fair
But now as the snow falls around me
I can see that your love isn't thereMy spark of life was spinning down the troubled seas of time
When first I saw your smiling face and youth was in its prime
Oh I'll never forget you wherever I roam wherever you may be
If ever I have had a friend you've been that freind to me

Misfortune nursed me as her child and loved me fondly too
I would have had a broken heart had it not have been for you
Oh I'll never forget you wherever I roam wherever you may be
If ever I have had a friend you've been that freind to me

I now look back upon the past across life's troubled sea
And smile to think thru all I've seen you've been a friend to me
Oh I'll never forget you wherever I roam wherever you may be
If ever I have had a freind you've been that friend to me

Oh I'll never forget you wherever I roam wherever you may be
If ever I have had a freind you've been that friend to meThru the long night in your kitchen over coffee
We'd talk and listen to the rain outside
I'd unload my mind of all it's troubles
And you'd smile and say that you were on my side

You were someone I could always turn to
When it seems there was no one left for me
I'd say you've really been a friend, babe
When you knew that friends was all we'd ever be

As the day goes by the memories grow fonder
Of the happy hours that I spent there with you
And it makes no difference where I wander
The nights are brighter when I dream of you

Just to know there's someone always waiting
With a gentle word and a friendly smile for me
I'd say you've really been a friend, babe
When we knew that friends were all we'd ever be

I'd say you've really been a friend, babe
But you knew you're more than just a friend to meOh I first met you down in lover's lane
You were just like an angel my little blue eye Jane
We walked along we sang a song words we sang in true
It would be like Heaven here on earth to be again with you
Cause your the girl of my dreams
But it seems that my dreams will never come true

At night we'd set out in the old porch swing
The stars was shining brightly while softly you would sing
You'd sing of happy days gone by you made me happy too
It would be like Heaven here on earth to be again with you
Cause your the girl of my dreams
But it seems that my dreams will never come true

Once you said you loved me too that you would be my own
But now you've gone so far away left me all alone
Another man has won your hand and took your love from me
But you still linger in my heart and in my memory
For your the girl of my dreams
But it seems that my dreams will never come trueNow you're the best of all the leading brands
From loveing kisses down to holding hands
I am happy only in your company
And no one else can make this grarantee

    You're the best and always number one
    You've got the competition of the run
    I'm sure that everybody understands
    I like you best of all the leading brands
    ( You're the best of all the leading brands )

Your new improved performance sure is great
To me there is no question how you rate
Your quality puts you so far shead
Your shape, your style, your looks sure knocks 'em deadNow meet me in the court room in the morning
    And you'll no longer by my wife
    You'll be free to go with hem tomorrow
    But remember you're still mine tonight

Go with him any place he wants to take you
You can go and do the things you like
But 'til then you're going to stay right here beside me
Just remember you're still mine tonight

 

And I'll see you for the last time in the morning
And I'll watch you walk out of my life
Tomorrow we'll say goodbye forever
But remember you're still mine tonightWe are saying goodbye dear forever
I'm leaving your false love behind
Every promise you made has been broken
You're no loneger a sweetheart of mine

    Go back to the bar down the street dear
    And stay with your honky tonk kind
    Go back to the life you've been living
    You're no loneger a sweetheart of mine

I wanted someone true and faithful
And that is the way it had to be
You wanted your honky tonk life dear
You're no longer a sweetheart to me

 

From a bottom to a ride in the moonlight
And the arms of the first man you see
Another victim added to your list dear
You're no longer a sweetheart to meYou're just what the doctor told me I was needing ( oh Doctor )
And I know he was right from the start
When I hold you close and kiss you I'm in heaven
You're just what the Doctor orderd for my broken heart

Not so long ago I thought I was in love
But now I know it wasn't meant to be ( meant to be )
The moment I met you my skies of gray truned to blue
And the tears I've shed are just a memory ( memory )

You're just what the doctor told me I was needing ( oh Doctor )
When he took my pulse and looked down at his chart
You're a lot sweeter than the one I shed those tears for
You're just what the Doctor ordered for my broken heart

I thought I'd found my dove be she fed me poison love
And now I'm glad you've gone and set me free ( set me free )
And now that you are mine the world is rolling fine
And the blues I knew is just a memory ( memory )On an evening long ago when the sun was sinking low
My true lover went to sall upon the sea
It was in the month of june when the roses were in bloom
When he took me in his arms said to me

    You're a flower that is blooming in the wildwood
    Flower that is blooming there for me
    Sweeter than the morning dew when I'll soon return to you
    You're a flower that is blooming there for me

Than a letter came to me from a captain on the sea
That told me my darling was dead
On the shock and great surprise made the teardrops in my eyes
When I thought about the last words that he said

 

Now he can't return to me he got drowned in the sea
And has done passed over lifes weary way
When it's in the month of june and the roses are in bloom
It seems that I can hear my lover sayYou'll never know how much you'll miss
The one that you love till she's gone
You'll never know, you'll neverknow how much you'll be
Lift all alone till shes gone, you'll never know
You'll wonder how you're gonna stop the pain
Or how you'll cry and want her back again
You'll wish a thousand times you hadn't said mean things
You'll wonder if the sorrow and regret will be in vain
You'll never know how much it hurts to know you were wrong
Till she's gone, you'll never knowSince I've been gone my Mammy says the old place ain't the same
The old hound dog is growing old and old Dobbin's getting lame
She says the place needs happy shouts of a young and rowdy crew
And that is why I won't be shy when I say this speech to you

    Oh I'm waitin' lettle gal fot the time I'll win your hand
    Take you back where I was born down in old Dixie Land
    The old home place will brighten up, everything will be so gay
    You'll make our shach a mansion when I bring you home to stay

Well the folks will all be happy when we come up the lane
Pa and Ma and Grand Pap will be smiling once again
They'll be so glad to welcome us to the old place on the hill
Cause I know what kind of folks they like and you sure fill the bill

 

Well you'll fit right in the circle around the old fire place
There'll be a look of pleasure on every smiling face
We'll be happier than the richest folk, won't worry night or day
You'll make our shack a mansion when I bring you home to stayI tried to tell you how I loved you
    And I tried to tell you night and day
    But when I'm gone no more to see you
    Honey you won't be satisfied that way

I'll leave you now if you don't want me
I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone no more to see you
Honey you won't be satisfied that way

 

 * Repeat 1st verseYou go to your church and I'll go to mine
But let's walk along together
Our fathers built them side by side
So let's walk along together

The road is rough and the way is long
But we'll help each other over
You go to your church and I'll go to mine
But let's walk along together

You go to your church and I'll go to mine
But let's walk along together
Our Heavenly Father is the same
So let's walk along together

The Lord will be at your church today
But he is at my church also
You go to your church and I'll go to mine
But let's walk along togetherTwo lovers sat in a quiet little place
Two lovers seated in one fond embrace
Whispering softly these words so srivine
You give me your love and I'll give you mine

    Tell me your love me and say you'll be true
    I'll love nobody in this world like you
    Your heart and my heart in love will entwine
    You give me your love and I'll give you mine

I've something to ask you while you're by my side
A question of love, a groom and a bride
And if you refuse me my heart it will pine
You give me your love and I'll give you mineHony you don't my mind
I'm lonesome all the time
Born to lose a drifter that's me
You tell her for so long
She'll make a ramblers heart go wrong
Baby you don't know my mind today

Heard the music of the raels
Slept in every old dirty jail
Oh, life's too short for you to worry me
Went the fine I can't win
I'm checking out again
Baby you don't know my mind today

Been a hobo and a tramp
That soul has done been stamped
For things I know I've learned the hard hard way
I ain't here to judfe or plear
Just to give me poor heart ease
Baby you don't know my mind today

Honey you don't know my mind
I'm lonesome all the time
Born to lose a drifter that's me
Well you say I'm sweet and kind
But I can love you 1000 times
Baby you don't know my mind todayI gave you every chance to be true
But it seems like that's too much for you
I took you back when you were running around
When you promised me you'd settle down

    You're just the kind that could never be true
    You break my heart with everything that you do
    It's better that I should even start again
    With you sweet heart I know I can't win

There's just no use trying to live with you
There's something wrong you'll never be true
You tear me up with your rambling ways
Then you could back and say you're home to stayI warned you not to give your lovce to him
I knew he would only break only heart
His kind of lovce you just can't win
And you can't make a heel toe the mark

    You can't keep time from rolling on
    You can't change the daylight from dark
    And you can't make a heel toe the mark

A leopard will never change its spots
A tiger will never change its stripes
A hound dog will never change its bark
And you can't make a heel toe the markYou can have her I don't want her
    She didn't love me anyway
    She only wanted someone to play with
    But all I wanted was love to stay

The girl I loved she up and left me
She run away with my best friend
She comes in around midnight
And they I come she's gone again

 

Well if you're in love with the wrong woman
There's only one thing that you can do
Just dig a hole and jump right in it
Then pull the ground in over you

 

Now life is mighty empty
Without love to call you own
I'd rather have love that I can cling to
That to has the world and all it's goldToday I'm alone and thinking of you
For you said we'd never part
But you done gone away and left me
Left me with a broken heart

    You promised to love me forever
    And to me you would always be the same
    But darling you broke your promise
    And now I know your little game

My heart's still crying for you darling
For it knows I love you true
And some day in the future sarling
Your heart may be crying too

 

I hope my dear you'll be happy
And never be alone and blue
For I still love you darling
Though you left me here so blueYou make time stand stil
Do it now and you always will
You take me as I am
You make me feel like a bland new man

Every time I fall down
I never get stuck
You get the combination, girl
To get me right back up
You are what I am
Loving you forever if I can

Think about the times we've had
We've never been blue
You got the combination, girl
To keep me straight and true
You are what I am
Loving you forever if I can

I know I'm lucky too
Without two or three just you and me
'Cos you are what I am
Loving you forever if I canIt takes a worried man to sing worried song
It takes a worried man to sing worried song
It takes a worried man to sing worried song
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long

I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
When I woke up, had shackles on my feet

Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
And on each link, an initial of my name

I asked that judge, tell me, what's gonna be my fine
I asked that judge, tell me, what's gonna be my fine
I asked that judge, tell me, what's gonna be my fine
Twenty one years on the Rocky Mountain line

The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
The girl I love, she's on that train and gone

I looked down the track, as far as I could see
I looked down the track, as far as I could see
I looked down the track, as far as I could see
A little bitty hand, was waving after me

If anyone should ask you, who made up this song
If anyone should ask you, who made up this song
If anyone should ask you, who made up this song
Tell 'em it was me, and I sing it all day longEach day I get so lonely while living here below
My Savior's waiting patiently I'm planning now to go
I want a firm foundation that's due to God's own hand
That's why I started building a road to glory land

    I'm working on the road ( I'm working on the road )
    That leads to glory ( that leads to glory )
    My Saviour's hand ( my Saviour's hand )
    I'm building my home ( I'm building my home )
    On things eternal ( on the things eternal )
    I'm working on the road ( I'm working on the road )
    To glory land

Oh listen to me sinners don't you wan't to go
You know we have no promise of living here below
You know he suffered for our sins and dien upon the cross
For all who did believe on him their souls will not be lost

 

And when this road is finished I want to travel on
I can hear the angels singing up there around the throne
I want to see my mother and take her by the hand
As soon as I have finshed the road to flory landIf I was a sinner I'll tell you what I would do
I'd quit my sinning and I'd work on the building, too

    I'm working on a building, I'm working on a building
    I'm worknig on a building, for my Lord, for my Lord
    It's a holy ghost building, it's a holy ghost building
    It's a holy ghost building, for my Lord, for my Lord

If I was a gambler, I'll tell you what I would do
I'd quit my gambling and I'd work on the building, too

 

If I was a drunkard I'll tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking and I'd work on the building, too

 

If I was a preacher, I'll tell you what I would do
I'd keep on preaching and I'd work on the building, tooSit down lady, we must talk
There is something I must say to you
I's been a ling and lonely walk we've had together
I must tell you that we're through
This woody guitar I hold in my hand
She will never set me free
No matter how much I love you, sweet lady
That's the way it's always been for me

Cause I hear a song
Lifted in the wind and I'll be gone
To try it onece again
This woody lady will always with me
She's the only kind of love I seem to need

You say that she can't love like you
I guess that what you say it true
You say that she will leave me old and sad and sorry
Like all woody ladies do
You know if I could change my mind
I wouldn't be this way at all
I'd take you back home to the fire with me, lady
But I know that someday I would fall

I'd hear a song
Lifted in the wind and I'd be gone
To try it once again
This woody lady will always be with me
She's the only kind of love I seem to needOh, how I'd like to be upon a windy mountain
    Where the treetops drape the sky
    Then I would forget all my worries and my trouble
    I'll just let the wind blow them by

Let me hear the leaves on the trees when they are singing
Just a moment of relief is all care
For I've got no sorrow, heartaches, or sadness
As long as I can see the trees this way

 

Tell my old lover in care you should see her
Just how much I love she'll never know
And that I've gone to rest away upon the mountain
Where the howling wind will always blow

 

Oh, my friends bury me way upon the mountain
Where that old wind will always blow
For I want to rest alone on the mountain
Where the howling wind will always blowHis age was seven years today
He don't know what it is to play
Each night before he goes to bed
This little prayer he always says

    Now I lay me down to rest
    Dear God please give me happiness
    I'm praying so my dreams come true
    So I can walk and play with you

His name they call him Willy Roy
He's just a little crippled boy
But now the tears roll down his cheeks
I wipe them off so he can sleep

 

Someday I hope you can go out
And play with me and walk about
I won't scold if you should cry
So soon, be good, my son good nightIn the big Pine woods on Willow Creek mountain
Is where I was raised to be a man
And it seems all the good things that spaw in my memory
Are tied to that Willow Creek land

The big dozier rumbles on Willow Creek mountain
The saw steals the life from the trees
The water is rising on Willow Creek mountain
And the dam that they said had to be

    So dam the men who dams up the river
    And dam the men who dam the life I've known
    Dam the world thats so ever changing
    For it robbed me of my Willow Creek home

The black smoke is rolling on Willow Creek mountain
Her beauty will fade with the land
The world won't remember Willow Creek mountain
Or the price paid for progress of manWe've been together for so long
It hurts to know your love is gone
Here's all my lonely heart can say
Will you be satisfied that way

Will you be satisfied to roam
Will memories stay when you are gone
A new love led your heart astray
Will you be satisfied that way

Its hard to stay when love is cold
So often that's the story told
I'm not asking that you pity me
Will you be satisfied that way

Deep down inside love you yet
I've suffered but there's no regret
Love can't be bought it must be free
Will you be satisfied that wayNow will you love me, little darling
When I'm in some other land
And you know I can't be with you
Or will you be loving another man

    Will you be loving another man
    Will you be loving another man
    When I return will you be waiting
    Or will you be loving another man

Now don't be crying on my shoulder
And telling me that love is grand
And before I'm out of sight, dear
Then be loving another manI don't want you cryin' cause I'm  leavin'
I don't want you cryin' cause I'm blue
Only my thoughts make me lonesome
Wonder if you're lonesome too ?
Wonder if you're lonesome too ?

    How would you like to be lonesome
    Someone as true as you
    My heart is sad and lonesome
    Wonder if you're lonesome too ?
    Wonder if you're lonesome too ?

Why should two lovers quarrel
Why should they be so untrue
I know what it means to be lonesome
Wonder if you're lonesome too ?
Wonder if you're lonesome too ?

 

Now give me your right hand honey
I'll say this farewell to you
I'll be so lonesome without you
Will you be lonesome too ?
Will you be lonesome too ?Will the roses bloom where she lies sleepin'
    Will the flowers shed their petals there
    Will the dew drops fall upon the roses
    Where my darling sleeps beneath the sand

Here lips were like a bunch of roses
Her eyes shined like the stars last night
And her hair was dark and it was curly
I'll love her still the day I die

 

How I miss my darling as she's sleeping
Underneath the beautiful sky
I miss her more now since she has left me
I know we've said our last good byeI was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

    Will the circle be unbroken
    Bye and bye, Load, bye and bye
    There's a better home a-waiting
    In the sky, Load, in the sky

Load, I told that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this body that you're hauling
Load, I hate to see her go

 

I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

 

I went home, my home was lonely
Now my mother she has gone
All my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and aloneI'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With hte roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtles so bright with emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

He told me he loved me and called me his flower
That blossomed for him all the brighter each hour
Though my heart is now breaking, he never shall know
That his name makes me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow

I'll sing and I'll dance and my laugh shall be gay
I'll charm every heart and the crowd I will away
I'll live you to see him regret the dark hour
When he won and neglected this frail wildwood flower

I'll think of him never, I'll be wild and gay
I'll cease this wild weeping, drive sorrow away
But I wake from my dreaming, my idol was clay
My visions of love have all vanished awayYou wouldn't read my letter if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I wanted to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

    I didn't know Gold made honky tonk angels
    I might have known you'd never make a wife
    You gave up the only one that ever loved you
    And went back to that wild side of life

The glamour of the gay night life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever knowThere's a girl in the mountain that I call my mountain honey
And I love her like the flowers love the dew
All the fellars try to claim her but someday I'm gonna claim her
Cause my wild mountain honey loves me to

    She's my wild mountain honey and I love her yes I do
    She's as sweet as any honey in the comb
    She's as pretty as the flowers that are blooming in the mountains
    And I'm going to marry her and bring her home

Oh I met her in the Smokey Mountains down in Tennessee
When the mountain laurel was blooming in the spring
Everything is bright and sunny and I'm saving up my money
For my wild mountain honey's wedding ringChildhood living is easy to do
The things that you wanted
Well I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you
Slide through my hand

    Wild horses couldn't drag me away
    Wild wild horses 
    We'll ride them some day

I watch you suffer
A dull aching pain yeah
And now you've decided
To show me the same
No sweeping exits
Of the stage lights
Could make me feel bitter
I treat you unkind

 

I know I dreamed you
A sin a lie
Now I have my freedom
But I don't have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living
After we dieAs I went out for to take a little walk
I came upon that Wild Bill Jones
He was a-walking and a-talking
By my true lover's side
I bid him to leave her alone

He said my age is twenty one years
Too old to be controled
So I drew my revolver from my side
Destroyed that poor boy's soul

So let's pass around that long necked bottle
And go out walking on the street
For today was the last of that Wild Bill Jones
Tommorrow will be the last of me

They sent me to prison for twenty long years
This poor boy longes to be free 
For Will Bill Jones and that long neck bottle
Have found their rid of meIn this awful world of sorrow
In this wicked path of sin
Never thinking of tomorrow
Or what I'd lose in the end

    Oh, I can hear the doorbell ringing
    Where my friends and loved ones wait
    Oh, I can hear the angels singing
    Just in side the pearly gates

I can hear my Savior calling
Won't you come unto me
Wash away your sins forever
You shall rest eternally

 

Now I'm safe with my Jesus
He will guide me on my way
I will sing his praise forever
We'll meet in Heaven some sweet dayI am asking of you, little darling
Are you tired of the love you possess
Are you longing to be with another
If you don't love me, why not confess
When you tell me that you are so lonely
Are your feeling you try to express
Are you longing to be with another
If you don't love me, why not confess

You have always told me that you loved me
And forever would be my sweetheart
I can tell by your countiess expressions
That my love has no place in your heart
When I'm round you are always complaining
You are trying to beat me I guess
Are you longing to be with another
If you don't love me, why not confess

I am thinking of you, little darling
In my heart you shall always remain
And I think it'd be best for me, darling
If I never would see you again
I am trying my best to forget you
Any my feelings I can not express
For my sake I am asking in earnest
If you don't love me, why not confessI can tell by the look in your eye
That you still care for me
But somehow you just won't admit
That's why I'm so lonesome you see

    Now if you have made up your mind
    And if you still want me to know
    Why do you keep me in doubt
    Why don't you tell me so

Each night there are tears on my pillow
They're all because of you I know
Dear I can't go on this away
Why don't you tell me so

 

Now there'll come a time little darling
When you will want me I know
But dear it will then be too late
For you to tell me soOh, why oh why did you wander
    Why did you ever roam
    When you know that we always were happy
    All alone in our old mountain home

Why down in the old Cumberland Mountains
Down in the hills of Tennessee
There she waited alone in the moonlight
There's she's waiting for me

 

Oh, why did you leave me little darling
Why did you leave me alone
When you knew I'd be lonesome without you
All alone in our old mountain home

 

I hope that you'll always be happy
It don't matter wherever you roam
And I long to be with you up in heaven
As we were in our old mountain homeOnce you were my life and breath
And you rode your sweet horse to death
You've been running round too much, 'til you lost your loving touch
Now whose shoulder will you cry on

    You didn't love me all alone
    Cause you can't love and do me wrong
    I don't trust you no more so go knock on another's door
    And whose shoulder will you cry on

Just let those hot tears burn your eyues
Cause they're just payments on the lies
That's made a wreck of me from that chain I've been set free
Now whose shoulder will you cry onI've heard mothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you

Every sweet thing that matters
Has bee broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you

Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away

Tho' our pathways have parted
To your  memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken hearted
How's the world treating you

Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do
Are you lonesome without me
Have you found someone new

Are you burning and yearning
Do you ever get blue
Do you think of returning
How's the world treating youWho's gonna ahoe your pretty little foot
Who's gonna glove your hand
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips
Who's gonna be your man

Papa will shoe my pretty little foot
Mama will glove my hand
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don't need no man

I don't need no man, poor boy
I don't need no man
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don't need no man

Longest train I ever did see
Was sixteen coaches long
The only girl ever did love
Was on that train and goneI wonder tonight who's loving you
Enjoying the kisses I once knew
And getting those letters of comfort and cheer
Who's calling you sweetheart tonight my dear

    Who's calling you sweetheart, who is the man
    So tenderly kissing and holding your hand
    Who's cherishing beauty of eyes so bright
    Who's tenderly calling you sweetheart tonight

Now I'm regretting my life here at last
Cherishing memory of love of the past
Seeking a refuge lasting at my side
Tell me who's calling you sweetheart tonightNow who will kiss your lips darling
    Who will call you sweetheart
    Who will tell you they love you
    For you once was my little sweetheart

Now who's been telking to you
Somebody's been telling you wrong
Things about me that you shouldn't believe
I'll miss you sweetheart when you're gone

 

This talk is going round town
Some of its I know its not true
Bout the thing's that I've done and the places I've been
For darling I've always loved youWho done it who was it broke your heart
    Who done it who keeps us apart
    You gamble with the love I gave untill another won it
    So when you find you all alone just ask yourself who done it

There was a time when you were nine and I belonged to you
You broke your vow so listen now while I give you a clue
I gave my heart to someone new because you tried to shun it
You want it back but its to late and your the one who done it

 

I offered you a bungalow with roses round the door
A diamond ring and everything but still you wanted more
You wanted to run your own life so I just let you run it
And when your dream train jumped the track I guess you know who done itLook here, you rascal, what you've done
Shot down my husband with your lver-Johnson gun
Carry me back, to Washington

He jumped on his horse he pulled on his mane
Said come on horse hotta outrun this train
Buffalo to Washington

The doctor came a-running he took off his specs
Said Mr.Mckinley better cash in your checks
You've bound to die you're bound to die

There's just one thing that troubles my mind
And that is to die and leave my poor wife behind
I'm bound to die I'm bound to die

Now hush up you children and don't you fret
You'll draw a pension after your pappy's dead
I'll be gonna a long long time

Yonder comes a train it's coming down the line
Blowing at every station Mr.Mckinley a-dying
It's hard times, it's hard time

Well, Roosevelt's in the White house, he's doing his best
Mckinley's in the grave yard taking his rest
He's gone, he's goneI'm going out on the highway
And listen to them big trucks wind
I'm going out on the highway
And listen to them big trucks wind
Oh, white freightliner, won't you steal away my mind

Well, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
The people here, they treat you kind
Well, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
The people here, they treat you kind
Oh, white freightliner, won't you steal away my mind

Well, it's bad news from Houston
Half my friends are dying
Well, it's bad news from Houston
Half my friends are dying
Oh, white freightliner, won't you steal away my mind

Lordy, Lord I'm gonna ramble
Till I get back to where I came
Lordy, Lord I'm gonna ramble
Till I get back to where I came
Till that white freightliner's gonna haul away my brainIn the deep grows in hills of old Virginia
There's a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell

    White dove will mourn in sorrow
    The willows will hang their heads
    I live my life in sorrow
    Since mother and daddy are dead

We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful, little mountain home
But the Saviour needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great while throne

 

As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the grave yard
Darkness finds me trying to prayTonight while I'm reading your letter
    You tell me you're going far away
    I love you my darling yes I love you
    I love you where ever you stray

I can see your blue eyes smiling for me
And they sparkle like no others do
You told me once you'd always love me
You said that you'd always be true

 

If ever you are lonely little darling
And no one has taken my place
Remember my darling I still love you
And long for your sweet smiling faceWhere will I shelter my sheep tonight
Where is that peaceful land
Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
Where the beasts won't steal my lambs

    We've travelled far, shepherded all in night
    Worried, sin sick in soul
    Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
    I'll shelter my sheep at Good's door

My soul is weak and thirsty too
As I crossed the burning sand
Where will I shelter my sheep tonight
Where is that peaceful landI have heard of a land on the far away strand
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Bult by Jesus on high, there we never shall die
'Tis a land where we never grow old

    Never grow old, never grow old
    In a land where we'll never grow old
    Never grow old, never grow old
    In a land where we'll never grow old

In that beautiful home where we'l never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
'Tis a land where we never shall die

 

When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And out troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on beforeOh, the ashes of a love affair left somking
Leaves my aching heart still burning with desire
I'll keep trying now the ashes to rekindle
It'd been told to me where there is smoke there's fire

    Once the fires of love within our hearts were raging
    Then I slowly watched the flames of love retire
    But I see a spark of love among the embers
    I'll rebuild for where there is smoke there's fire

If I wait too long the sparks will die in hunger
Of a love that can make them burn with desire
If cherish them with love as I remember
Thet will burn again for where there's smoke there's fireTo Canaan's land I'm on my way
Where the soul (of man) never dies
My darkness night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) never dies

    No sad farewells
    No tear-dimmed eyes
    Where all is love and
    The soul (of man) never dies

	
    (Dear friends, there'll be no sad farewell)
    (There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes)
    (Where all is peace and joy and love)
    (And the soul of man never dies)

A rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies

 

A love light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines to light the shores of home
Where the soul (of man) never dies

 

My life will end in deathless sleep
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And everlasting joys I'll reap
Where the soul (of man) never dies

 

I'm on my way to that fair land
Where the soul (of man) never dies
Where there will be no parting hand
Where the soul (of man) never diesAs I sit and think of dixie cotton fields and whippoorwills
Where I spent my happy childhood among the rocks and among the rills
I can see my dear old mother as around the place she gones
On my farm in Louisiana where the old red river flows

    I-ee-o-lay-ee
    You can hear the people singing soft and low
    And at twilight in the evening
    So soft and low, so low
    On my farm in Louisiana where the old red river flows

Well the lights are bright tonight on Brosdway the cities fair as day
On the beach at Coney Island where the breezes make you gay
I'm heading south tonight love on the IC when she goes
To my farm in Louisiana where the old red river flowsWhere is my wandering boy tonight
The boy of my tenderest care
The boy that was once my joy and light
The child of my love and prayer

    Where is my boy tonight
    Where is my boy tonight
    My heart o'erflows, for I love him, he knows
    O where is my boy tonight

Once he was pure as morning dew
As he knelt at his mother's knee
No face was so bright, no heart more true
And none was so sweet as he

 

O chould I see you now my boy
As fair as in olden time
When prattle and smile made home a joy
And life was a merry chime

 

Go for my wand'ring boy tonight
Go search for him where you will
But bring him to me with all his blight
And tell him I love him stillIt's a long and dusty road, it's a hot and heavy load
And the people that you meet aren't always kind
Some are bad, some are good some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troubled mind

    But I can't help but wonder
    Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
    I can't help but wonder where I'm bound

I have been around this land just doing the best I can
Trying to find what I was meant to do
And the faces that I see are as worried as can be
And I think that they are wondering too

 

I had a buddy way back home, till he started out to roam
Now I hear he's out by Frisco Bay
Sometimes when I've had a few, his voice comes singing through
And I'm going out to see him some old day

 

If you see me passing by and you sit and wonder why
You weren't meant to be a rambler too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace them up, and bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over youMy eyes are getting weaker, my steps are getting slow
And the gray in my hair is beginning to show
My life has been rich though I've always been poor
Our youth passed so quickly
Where did our young years go

    There's something between us so few understand
    You made me your king, though I'm a plain working man
    Our home and our babies have left our love aglow
    But where, Oh, where did our young years go

Your face may be wrinkled, your dress may be worn
But your lips are still tener, thriulling and warm
Each day of life our love seems to grow
But where, oh where did our young years goOh I'm thinking of you, little darling
Of the day that we first met
And those world sweetheart that you told me
I'm sure I'll never forget

    Oh, someday, sweetheart, when you're lonely
    And have no one to care for you
    Remember the heart you have broken
    And the one that has loved you so true

You told me that you always loved me
And no one could ever come between
But it seems to me you've forgotten
All those things you told to me

 

I'll forget those things that you told me
And try to start a life anew
But remember the heart you have broken
And the one that has loved you so trueThere's an old and rusty wagon that's left to rot away
It's one my family rode in back in the good old days
People loved their neighbors everybody was so free
And riding in a brand new wagon was something to see

    I can still see my Daddy sitting on the wagon seat
    Mom in her old sun bonnt, she looked so nice and neat
    Kids were all in the wagon, Grandmam and Grandpa too
    Oh we used to go to church on Sunday when the wagon was new

Red wheels were on the wagon and the body it was green
We were all so happy as riding in a limousine
People used to gather round through all the mountain side
Take a look at the brand new wagon and all take a ride

 

Well the automobiles are here now, the wagon days are throught
Airplanes are a-humming, neighbors are so few
Everybody's in a hurry, it's money that takes you through
But we didn't need much money when the wagon wes new

 

Yes, we used to go to church on Sunday, when the wagon was newI will fly away when the storm is over
I will fly away when the storm is over
But I'll be back in the spring
When the robins chirp and the rivers sing
I will fly away when the storm is over

The chestunt mare is meek and mild
You know she's mother nature's child
She stand undaunted in the rain
The water drips off tall and mane
Ponies in the field, dancing in the clover
Ponies in the field, dancing in the clover


Well, I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine
And we'll have a real good, real good time
I will fly away when the storm is over


I will fly away when the storm is over
I will fly away when the storm is over
But I'll be back in the spring
When the robinds chrip and rivers sing
I will fly away when the storm is overOnce my soul was astray from the heavenly way
I was wreched and blind as could be
But my Saviour, in love, gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me

    When the Saviour reached down for me
    When he reached down his hand for me
    I was lost and undone without God or his Son
    When he reached down his hand for me

How my heart does rejoice, when I hear his sweet voice
In a tempest to him I can cling
I can lean on his arm, safe and sure from all harm
When he reaches down his hand for meWhen the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal, bright and fair
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there

    When the roll is called up yonder
    When the roll is called up yonder
    When the roll is called up yonder
    When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there

On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When his chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there

 

Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wondrous love and care
Then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be thereI left the one that love in the mountain
And all the love we shared
But each night as she kneels by her bed side
I know she calls my name in her prayer

    When the moon shaines on the blue ridge mountain
    And it seems I can hear my sweetheart call
    How I long to be near my sweetheart call
    when the golden leaves begin to fall

She knows that I'll return to the mountain
And will bring to her a wedding ring
It will be place upon her finger
Happyness to both it will bring

 

Winter time is so cold in the mountain
The ground will soon be covered white with snow
How I long to keep the home fives burning
for I know my darling needs me soI'm the laugh of the party, out every night            
Ain't got a worry but then       
The people who say I'm carefree and gay                
Don't know how I'm lonely when the bright lights grow dim  

           
People think cause I'm laughing, the past is behind    
But they don't know the sorrow withinA heart that is hurtin' in a man bound by pride        
Who cries for an old love when the bright lights grow dim  

           
When the party has ended the loughter has died         
And I think of our parting again 
The smile leaves my face and tears take its place      
I cry for you darling when the bright lights grow dim  
           
So until you return I'll keep wearing a mask           
That will hide how I'm feeling withinSo if your lonely too I'll be right there with you     
I'll be thinking of you dear when the bright lights grow dimBy the millstreams sits the Miller's lovely daughter
Her cheeks are like the first red rose of June
Her weet voice sounds like the rippling water
As so tenderly she hums an old love tune
But soon her song of love has turned to sorrow
For her weetheart has come to say goodbye
He is thinking sadly of the morrow
As he kisses her and murmurs with a sigh
    
    When the bees are in the hive and the honey's in the comb
    And the golden sun beams bend to kiss the dew
    As the old mill wheel truns round I love you Mary
    When the bees are in the hive I'll come to you

By the mill stream slts a lonely maid pining
And her fancy like the stream, rolls far away
As she looks into the silvery water shining
She sdds her golden locks now tinged with grey
Long years she's waited there for his returning
But the years pass by and her waiting's all in vain
As she looks down the river for his coming
So tenderly she sings this old refain

 * RefarainI am growing old and feeble
Friends and loved ones I must leave
For tomorrow I'll be lifted
When the angels come for me

    When the angels come to get me
    In a chariot of pure gold
    I'll be carried up to heaven
    On that hallelujah road

Life down here has been so happy
Though this world which I've trod
But I'll move into a mansion
Where I'll dwell forever more

 

There I'll be with my dear Savior
Dad and Mother I will see
All these joys will be mine forever
When the angels come for meMenories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But some day they'll live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

    When my blue moon turns to gold again
    When the rainbow turns the clouds away
    When my blue moon turns to gold again
    You'll be back in my arms to stay

The lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams they live again sweetheart
But my golden moon is just a memory

 

The castles we built of dreams together
Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to goldIn the sky the silvery moon was shining
All around was sweetness of the spring
Now she's gone but thoughts of her grow sweeter
When it's time for the whippoorwill to sing

    How I long for the day when I shall meet her
    If it be where the angels sweetly sing
    She is mine and thoughts of her grow sweeter
    When it's time for the whippoorwill to sing

I remember the night she made the promise
Oh, to me sweet joy these words did bring
Fare thee well and I know you'll find me waiting
When it's time for the whippoorwill to singWhen it's reveille time in heaven and heress there
As they proudly stand attention at the throne
Then the winds will play an anthemn
As it echoe's from the park
And ease a signal from an evening star

    It was ranks of marching thousand trampion over heaven's sod
    From the pilots to the dismal of the same
    They are all of one and equal in this wonder holy land
    And reveille played by heavens band

When the universe commander takes the great reviewing stand
They are cited one by one ass they go by
They are highly decorated in a robe of going white
As he receives a blessing from his grave

 * Rafrain

Well there's master sergeant Johnny with his crutches thrown away
His purple heart no longer could be seen
There my boy stands beside him with a small upon his face
As he receives a blessing from his grave

 

When they call Revelle, Reveille in heaven for my boy
He'll stand there smiling thru as did for the red, white and blue
He'll rest in peace up there for ever more
No more fighting like he had to do before
He's just waiting for his mother, his dad, his sis and brother
When its reveille time in heaven for my boyWhen autumn leaves begin to fall
    It's then I hear my mother call
    Her tender voice I hear in song
    I ask forgiveness for each wrong

When a boy of only fifteen years
I left home in seach of new frontiers
A house of gold I then did wed
A wall of stone I built within

 

Now my mother she has passed away
Not one kindness did I show or say
For all the wealth I might have shared
Mother never knew I caredIf you think it's nice to be untrue
Then don't camplain if I start cheating too
Should I be bound while you go fancy free
What's Good for you should be all right for me

    If it's right for you to cheat and lie
    It can't be wrong for me to break a tie
    Should I be bound while you go fancy free
    What's Good for you should be all right for me

If it's fair for you to run around
How can you feel that I should be tied down
I'm human too so why can't you agree
What's Good for you should be all right for meThis is a would, full of trouble and strife
Brothers you know not the days of your life
If witheout warning, the trumpet should call
What would you give in exchange for your soul

    What would you give, what would you give
    What would you give in exchange for your soul
    Oh, if today God called you away
    What would you give in exchange for your soul

Never do wrong, but ever do right
If you desire to shine in God's sight
For if you miss that heavenly goal
What would you give in exchange for your soul

 

Satan awaits around every turn
Hoping in Hell your soul it will burn
If you should face the fire and coal
What would you give in exchange for your soul

 

Harken to God and you shall be saved
You will see heaven with gold it is paved
But if you sin and need one to console
What would you give in exchange for your soulYou were my hearts desire you set the flame of love on fire
No other love cold take the place of you
Then you left me all alone so lonesome and so blue
And I found someone to take your place, what was I suppose to do

    Was I to walk the floor and worry over endless days to come
    Or cry and plea down on my kness for you
    I couldn't stand to be alone you left me nothing else to choose
    So I found someone to take your place, what was I suppose to do

I know I vowed there'd never be no other love
The dream that I'd been searching for was you
But then that dream came to an end there was no use to pretend 
So I found someone to take your place, what was I suppose to doThe days have seemed long and I have been lonesome
Recalling those dream, that never came true
The nights have been lonely, but now that's all over
I've paid my debt for trusting in you

    Every day your memory grows dimmer
    Clouds drift away sunshine creeps thrue
    Every night no longer you haunt me
    My conscience is clear, what about you

It's hard to believe that you are the same one
That once meant so much, whom I loved so true
It's hard to know I worshipped a false one
But I've paid for it, what about youWhat a friend we have in mother
Who will all our secrets share
We should never keep things from her
Tell her all and she'll be there

O what tender love she gives us
When in sorrow or despair
Tell her gently, whisper
Tell her gently, whisper softly
She will listen, she'll be there

Day by day as she grows older
She's the nation's shining sun
Don't forget the prayers she taught you
You will need them where you are

Though her hair has truned to silver
Send her flowrs sweet and fine
Drop a card, or send a letter
She'll be waiting, she'll be there

When her eyes are closed to slumber
Gently kiss her icy brow
Fold her hands upon her bosom
She will rest in Heaven now

When your days are dark and dreary
And your cross is hard to bear
Do not let your memory fail you
Think of mother, she'll be thereWere you there when they crucified my Lord
Were you there when they crucified my Lord
O sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord

Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree
O sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord

Were you there when they pierced him in the side
Were you there when they pierced him in the side
O sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord

Were you there when the sun refused him in the side
Were you there when the sun refused him in the side
O sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord

Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
O sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they crucified my LordToday I got the letter, that you wrote me
You told me soon that you'd be coming home
You ask me to forgive, and said you loved me
And said you missed me so since you've been gone

    I guess I'm just a fool, but I'm so lonely
    If only for awhile you would be true
    Yes welcome home my darling, I'll be waiting
    The welcome mat is on the step for you

My friends all say, I'm crazy to forgive you
But they're not faced with sorrow such as mine
Now just the thoughts, of having you back home dear
Is making me feel better all the timeI have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But dear I hope you're happy just the same

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I planned a little cottage in the valley
I ever bought a little band of gold
I thought someday I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I hear the children laughing now with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

How fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your fair
While the organ plays I love you truly
Just let me pretend that I am there

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But wedding bells will never ring for meWhen youget this letter dearest darling
I' ll be on the train heading home
My thoughts are only of you, love
While these many moons I've roamed

    Meet me there down by the river
    Where we met that summer night
    If you still love me wear a red rose
    If you don't then wear the white

Tell my mom and dear old daddy
That I want to see them too
This world and all of its pleasures
Can't take the place of home and you

 

I hope I'm still first in your heart, dear
Or is another there instead
When I meet you by the river
I hope the rose you wear is redThe time has come to say goodbye
I'm asking you to please don't cry
The time to me won't be so long
To know you're happy back at home

Someday we'll meet again sweetheart
We'll meet and never more to part
Someday we'll meet again sweetheart
Don't cry, so please don't break my heart

So goodbye now, don't be blue
Try to be happy and be true
And remember what I say
Sweetheart we'll meet again someday

So sweetheart I'm leaving now
Yes, I'll soon be on my way
Each night upon my knees I play
Sweetheart we'll meet again somedayDarling do you really love me
    Are you the girl used to know
    Something's happened to you darling
    But it pleases me know

life is sweet when love is blooming
Like a wild rose on the hill
But when lovers part forever
Where it ends no one can tell

 

Many lonely nights I've traveled
Far across the barren land
Thinking of that peaceful village
Where we once strolled hand in hand

 

When our journey here is ended
And this life on earth is done
We'll be sweethearts up in heaven
For me I know you are the oneYou can read it in the morning paper
Hear it on the radio
How crime is sweeping the nation
This world is about to go

    We need a good old case of salvation
    To put the love of God in our soul
    We need a shole lot more of Jesus
    And a lot less rock and roll

We need more old time camp meeting
And a lot more prayers of faith
Prayers that will move a mountain
Save our souls from the burning wave

 

We need more old fashioned preachers
Pouring out their hearts in prayer
When you're in their presence
You know that the Lord is thereWe live in two different worlds, dear
Thats why we're so far apart
You made your world out of vows that are broken
I built a world in my heart

Every one here tride to warn me
You were just playing a game
I told them all we were meant for each other
I thought our worlds were the same

If you stay over in your world
Oh, how my poor heart will pine
Dearling someday when your memories wander
Won't you come over to mine

We live in two different worlds, dear
My world is honest and true
Sweetheart remember when your world gets lonely
I'll still be waiting for youDarling you often said you loved me
But you've gone on before
You don't know dear how I miss you
But we can't be darlings anymore

    Darling I'm sad and lonely
    Since you've gone on before
    For down here on this lonely earth here
    We can't be darlings anymore

Until we meet up there in heaven
Then we can walk the golden shore
But down here on this lonely earth here
We can't be darlings anymore

 

I have lost a million tears dear
Since you left this world alone
But we can never be again darling
Tell we meet around the throneSee that watermelon a'hanging on the fence
How I wish that melon was mine
Some folks are foolish, they just don't have no sense
Or they wouldn't leave that melon on the vine

    Hambone it is sweet, chicken it is good
    Rabbit is so very, very fine
    But give me, oh give me, oh how I wish you would
    That watermelon hanging on the vine

You may talk about your peaches, your apples and your pears
Simmons growing on the tree
Folks have their favorites just most every where
But that watermelon is the best for me

 

I went to get that melon, I thought I'd have some fun
The stars they had just begun to shine
But when I heard some moving, I left there on the run
But I didn't leave that melon on the vineOak tree's scatter leaves on the river
While acorns washed up on the clay
As squirrels gather food for the winter
And I sit here Wasting Away

    Oh if dreaming could make you my darling
    I wouldn't be lonely today
    And if wishing could bring back the good times
    I wouldn't be Wasting Away

I stared at the tree's in the water
Until the reflection turned gray
The fall settles low on the poplar
And me I'm just Wasting AwayI'm walking the dog and I'm rather blue
I'm walking the dog, I ain't thinking about you
I don't need no one to tie me down
I'm walking the dog and I'm painting the town

    Such an easy life I never knew
    Until the day that I left you
    I'm a carefree lad that's seen the light
    ( Well ) I'm walking the dog all day and all night

I'm full of pep, Lord, I can't frow old
I got a one-track mind so I've been told
well I'm fancy free and I don't worry now
I'm walking the dog, all the law will allowWell I'm walking down the line
    I'm walking down the line
    I'm walking down the line
    My feet about my trouble mind

I've got a heavy headed gal
I've got a heavy headed gal
I've got a heavy headed gal
She ain't a feeling well
When she's better only time well tell

 

My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
And rolls and flows and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets of my clothes

 

I see the morning light
I see the morning light
I see the morning light
Well it's not because I'm an early riser
I didn't go to sleep last nightNow, if you see that girl of mine
Tell her if you please
When she bakes those biscuits
To roll up her sleeves

    Walkin' in my sleep, baby
    Walkin' in my sleep
    Up and down that Dixie line
    Walkin' in my sleep

Yonder comes my baby
How do you think I know
I know her by her pretty little curls
Hanging down so low

 

Bake them bisxuits baby
Bake them good and brown
When I get my breakfast
I'm Alabama bound

 

Pain in my finger
Pain in my toe
Pain in my ankle bone
I ain't a-gonna work no moreYou say you're sorry once again dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helpin hand dear
But thats what you told me once before

    Walk softly on this heart of mine love
    Don't treat it mean and so unkind
    Let it rest in peace and quiet love
    Walk softly on this heart of mine

I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
But please let mne down real easy 
For loneliness moves in as you move onJohn said the city was just four square
Walk in the Jerusalem just like John
And he declared he'd meet me there
Walk in the Jerusalem just like John

    I want be ready,I want be ready,I want be ready   
    To walk in the Jerusalem just like John 

Oh, John, Oh, John, what do you say
Walk in  the Jerusalem just like John
That I'll be there in the coming day
Walk in the Jerusalem just like John

 

When Peter was preAching at Pentacost
Walk in the Jerusalem just like John
He was endowed with the Holy Ghost
Walk in the Jerusalem just like JohnTwo years ago when I first met you
You smiled at me and looked so sweet
You made me think you cared about me
But you never did say you loved me

    I'm waiting to hear you call me darling
    I'm waiting to hear you call me dear
    You know that I have always loved you
    Don't make me lonely all these years

Oh maybe I've took too much for granted
To think you could ever love me
Oh please, Oh please, don't try to fool me
All I have is miseryFron the great Atlantic ocean ti the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowin' mountains to the south balls by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quit well by all
She's the combination of the Wabash cannonball

    Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
    As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
    Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's squall
    You're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash cannonball

She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash cannonball
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee, she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash cannonball

 

Here's to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts of Alabam
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to victory on the Wabash cannonballIt was in the time of autumn
The golden leaves lay all around
That we laid our dear old father
Alway beneath the cold damp ground

    It seems but a short time ago
    That he was in the fullest bloom
    But death, alas, has laid him low
    Another victim to the tomb

Many sad farewells were given
Many bitter tears were shed
Our sad hearts all beat with anguish
As he lay on his dying bed

  

On a Savior's summons he was readied
On his journey home to go
And fearless though near the dark valleys
Washed in his blood whiter than snowMake my bed
With a crease in the middle
Make my home
In the Hollywood of shills
And I make my living
With a hillbilly fiddle
Playing littel runs
With the funny little fills

Well got me a gal
From playing on my fiddle
And the farder that I fiddle
The harder that she comes along
But we gotta get happy
When we wiggle in the middle
That's when I know
That I want to come home

Play, fiddle, play
All day long I hear you screaming at mt
Way far away in the yard

Well, I wrote this song
With a vamp in the middle
And I knew when I wrote it
That I'd written it for the fiddle

Play, fiddle, play
All day long I hear you screaming at me
Way far away in the yardThere's an old broken lock on the old cabin door
The cracks and the holes in the old cabin floor
In my tumble down shack I long to go back
And dwell in that shack ever more

    Peace, peace the Valley of peace
    Where sorrows are known
    Like a heaven, yes heaven it seems
    Peaceful valley my home

Through an old broken window the lights I let shine
Twinkles and shines through the honeysuckle vine
By the old rustic well there's a sweet little Nell
And for me I know how she pinesI'm using my bible for a road map
And to my heart they tell me what to do
Declared the bible for my road map
And Jeses protects me, take me through

    There'll be no dtours in heaven
    No rough roads along the way
    I'm using my bible for a road map
    And I'll stop in heaven somesweet day

I'm using my bible for a road map
That journey I've been though you can too
They caused a passage of destruction
For God was at here as he came throughWell its 5 o'clock in the morning till 10 c'clock at night 
It's 5 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night
I work so hard to live that I ain't got no life

    Up this hill and down, up this hill again
    Up this hill and down, up this hill again
    It's a might long road one ain't got no end

Sometimes I got me troubles, other times its misery
Sometimes I got such troubles other times its misery
It seems like everything bad just hanging round me

  

Someday I'm going to have money, and I won't have to work so hard
I'm saving up all my money so I won't have to work so hard
On Saturday spend it with my woman and on Sunday talk with my Lord

  

Well its 5 o'clock in the morning till 10 o'clock at night
It's 5 o'clock every morning untill 10 o'clock at night
I woke so hard to live that I ain't got no lifeI'm wanting someone that's loved and lost
Someone that's known the thrill and paid the cost
Someone that says they'll never take a chance
Of another broken heart by false romance

    Wanted an unwanted love
    To share all the misery and pain
    Of a heart that's unwanted in love
    And unwilling to gamble again

I don't want to love again I'm sure
Someone who's love is not sincere
I don't want someone that hasn't known
How it feels to love and then be left alone

  

I know there are others like me
Alone, foot loose and fancy free
Yet chained to a love they'll never claim
And afraid to ever love againUnfaithful one you'll have to suffer
    You're doomed to go through life alone
    For no one else will ever trust you
    They'll know your heart is made of stone

I still recall our happy years dear
Our love was fresh as flowrs of spring
But now you've left me for a stranger
You've lost the right o wear my ring

  

So blue was I the day you left me
My heart was sad and lonely too
My place was taken by this stranger
You traded an old love for a newDown in old Kentucky
Well there was an old man lived all alone
And they called him fiddlin' Will
Every day about sundown
You could hear him play for a mile away
A tune called Katy Hill

    Uncle Will played the fiddle
    Well about every day you could hear him play
    From his little log cabin on the hill
    Uncle Will played the fiddle
    Well, there Hall of Fame
    That could play like Fiddlin' Will

Uncle Will played the fiddle
He could play an old hoedown
Just the way it should sound
Many long years ago
Uncle Will played the fiddle
And there by his side
On the day he died
They found his fiddle and bow

  

He could play em fast
He could play em slow
Just like the man on the radio
But there's one thing about Uncle Will
He never took his fiddle
From his cabin on the hillOh, the people would come far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
When the caller hollered, Dosedo
He'd knew Uncle Pen was redy to go

    Late in the evening about sundown
    High on the hiss above the town
    Uncle Pen played the fiddle
    Oh, how it would ring
    You can hear it take, you can hear it sing

He played an old piece called soldier's joy
And in the morning told the folsome boy
The greatest of all was Jenny Lynn
To me that's worse when women begin

  

I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to goHave you ever been to meeting, Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe
Have you ever been to meeting, Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe
Have you ever been to meeting, Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe

Would you rather ride a pacer, Uncle Joe, etcI'm walking the floor with tears in my eyes
I can't undersand dear why you ever lied
The stars in the skies have tumbled below
Now my heart is breaking it's beating so low

    The moment you walked dear into my heart
    What a wonderful meeting for two lonely hearts
    You gove me your love to have and to hold
    But something has happened you took the wrong road

You said you would love and you would obey
But the Golden Rule's broken so go on your way
I've lost all the faith that I've had in you
So go on away dear you could never be trueTow little boys had two little toys
Each had a wooden horse
Gaily they played on a summer's day
Warriors both of course
One little chap a mishap
Broke off his horse's head
Wept for his toy but cried joe
When he heard his brother say

Do you think I could leave you crying
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here Jack and stop your crying
We'll mend your horse with glue
When we grow up we'll both be soldiers
And our horses will not be toys
And maybe you will remember
When we were two little boys

Long years had passed, war came at last
Bravely they marched away
Cannons roared loud, midst that wild crowd
Where wounded and dying Joe lay
Then came a cry, a rider dashed by
Out from the ranks of blue
Galloped away to where Joe lay
And he heard his brother say

Do you think I could leave yu dying
When there's room on my house for two
Climb up here Joe, we'll soon be flying
To the ranks of the boys in blue
Can't you see Jack I'm all a-tremble
It may be thye flash and the noise
Or it may be because I remember
When we were two little boysI want two arms to hold me when I'm feeling blue
I want some one to love me with a love so true
I want two lips to kiss me as they used to do
I want two arms to hold me, darling I want you

    I want two arms to hold me and never let me go
    If you ever love me my dear I want to know
    Cause when I'm sad and lonely that's when I want you so
    I want two arms to hold me when I'm feeling low

You used to say you loved me you used to hold me tight
Now you leave me lonely too long for you at night
I want two arms to hold me that held me close before
The arms that used to hold me won't reach for me no more

 

When shadows start to falling and you're alone and blue
You'll want two arms to hold you that used to care for you
Just listen to me darling and this little song
You'll want two arms to hold you and you may find me goneI've been to the doctor he says I'm all right
I know he's lying I'm losing my sight
He should have examined the eyes of my mind
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blind

With my eyes wide open I lay in my bed
If it wasn't for dying I wish I was dead
But this is my punishment death is to kind
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blind

You just couldn't know her way that I do
You say that she's wicked and may be its true
But there's one thing I do know she's no longer mine
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blind

I've lost her, I've lost her oh what will I do
I bet your not happy if she's there with you
The eyes of your heart will have trouble like mine
Twenty twenty vision and walking round blindThe judge said stand up boy and boy dry up your tears
You're sentenced to Nashville for Twnenty one years
They took him to Nashvill to pay for his crime
Twenty one years boy is a mighty long time

A year went by slowly he wished he was dead
In the dirty old prison with the floor for a bed
The girl who he loved and dreamed of each night
He wrote her this letter saying why don't you wrote

I counted on you dear to give me a break
I guess you've forgotten, I'm here for your sake
You know who is guilty you know it too well
But I'll rot in this prison before I will tell

Come all you young follows with hearts so true
Don't believe any woman you're lost if you do
Don't trust any woman no matter what kind
For twenty one years dear is a mighty long timeWell, come and listen in to a radio
Staiton where the mighty hosts of heaven sing
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
If you want to feel those good vibrations
Coming from the joy that His love can bring
Turn uyour radio on, turn your radio on

    Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
    Turn your radio on, heaven's glory share
    Turn your lights down low and listen to the Master's radio
    Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Don't you know that everybody has a radio receiver
All you got to do is listen for the call
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
If you listen in you will be a believer
Leaning on the truths that were never false
Get in touch with God, turn your radio onWell, I had an old hen and she had a wooden leg
Just the best old hen that ever laid an egg
Well, she laid more eggs than any hen on the farm
But another little drink wouldn't do her any harm

    Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay
    Turkey in the straw, in the straw ,straw, straw
    Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
    And hit up a tune called Turkey in the straw

Well, I hitched up the wagon and I drove down the road
With a two horse wagon and a four horse load
Well cracked my whip and the lead horse sprung
And I said goodbye to the wagon tongue

 

Well, if frogs had wings and snakes had hair
And automobiles went a flying thro' the air
Well if watermelons grew on a hucleberry vine
We'd have winter in the summer time

 

Oh, I went out to milk and I didn't know how
I milked a goat instead of a cow
A monkey sitting on a pile of straw
A-winkin' his eyes at his mother in law

 

Well, I come to the river and I couldn't get across
So I paid five dollars for an old blind horse
Well, he wouldn't go shead and he wouldn't stand still
So he went up and down like an old saw millI hate to see the sun sink low
Just for a song you ought to know
For it's true love I can't forget
All of my sorrows you'll soon regret

You promised me love that was true
And I'm sorry to say that I believed in you
For it all turned out just like a dream
The people sang and the world is free

There's dishes to wash and a house to clean
There's washing to do, oh, it seems so mean
There's a million words I can't explain
They called this girl, though I changed her name

They'll go away and leave you at home
And never care if you're alone
They seem to forget they've got a wife
This story is sad, but it's true to lifeI stoped at a roadhouse in Texas
A little place called Humberger Inn
I heard that old pike boxi morning
A true called Truck driving man
The waitress then brought me some caffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said this old song sure does hit me
'Cause I am a truck driving man

    Pour me another cup of caffee
    For it is the best in the land
    I'll put a quarter in the jukebox
    And play the truck driving man

I climebed back aboard my old diesel
And true like a flash I was gone
I got them big truck wheels to rollin'
Now I'm on my way to SunAnton
When I get my call up Glory
And then take me away from this land
I'll cry my truck up to heaven
'Cause, I'm truck driving manFrom Caroline to Alabam, on down that Georgia line
I've seen lost of pretty girls but there's none as sweet as mine
As I put the miles behind me with the headlights burning bright
Gotta keep these big wheels rolling I'm coming home tonight

    Ain't got time to shoot the pinball or get the rader blues
    Gotta keep these big wheels rolling I'm coming home to you
    I know my baby's waiting the sweetest ever seen
    With big blue eyes that sparkle, she's a truck driver's Queen

At the cafes and truck stops all up and down the line
I see lost of pretty girls but there's none as sweetest I've ever seen
Gotta keep these big wheels rolling to my truck driver's QueenMy troubles seem to never end
It seems I lose I never win
The nights are long walk the floor
Troubles keep hanging round my door

My troubles seem to never end
They go on forevermore
Although I'll smile and pretend
Troubles keep hanging round my door

What have I done your love is gone
But still I'm trying to hang on
You honkey tonk all over town
Troubles have really got me downTrouble in mind, I'm blue
    But I won't be blue always
    You know the sun's gonna shine
    In my back door some day

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Gonna let that big 800
Satisfy this mind of mine

 

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is beating slow
I ain't had so much trouble
In my life beforeOnly a tramp was Lazarus that day
He who lay down at the rich man's gate
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street

He was some mother's darling, he was some mother's son
Once he was fair and once he was young
Some mother rocked him, her darling, to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street

Jesus who died on Calvary's tree
Shed his life's blood for you and me
They pierced his side, his hands, and his feet
Then they left him to die like a tramp on the street

If Jesus should come and knock at your door
For a place to lie down or bread from your store
Would you welcome him in or turn him away
For God would reward you on the great Judgment DayOh, you ought to been updown
To see that train come down
And hear the whistle blow a hundred times
Oh, hear that train coming round the bend
Blow like she'll never blow again
I'm going up the track bring my little girlie back
I'm tired of living this a way
Train Forty Five, just as sure as you're alive
She blows like she'll never blow no more
If the train runs right
See mu woman Saturday night
About a hundred miles away from homeNestled in the heart of the Tennessee hills
Midst peaceful pines neath the rocks and the rills
There stands my old homestead of long years ago
Brings back sweet memories of the one I loved so

I courted a maiden so weet and so fair
With pearly blue eyes and with chestnut brown hair
She promised to love and said she's be mine
But I went awayt leaving her there behinde

I'll tell you the reason why I left her there
To roam this old world with its sorrow and cares
I saw her one night in the arms of a man
Hugging and kissing as true lovers can

I went to my home with a heart full of woe
Packed my velongings determined to go
For many long years this old world I did roam
With toughts of my sweetheart my darling my own

While dining one day in a little country town
A stranger came in and he chanced to sit down
While talking of loved ones I happened to find
That his sister was that old sweetheart of mine

Now I am the man who you saw that fateful night
Wrapped in the arms of my sister so tight
She waited so long for the day you'd return
And why you had left her she neer did learn

When he heard my story to me then he said
The one that you loved has a long time been dead
She loved you so dearly but you broke her heart
Poor stranger from her ever more you must partDarling you, toyed with toy heart
    I think you played the game right from the start
    This toy heart was broken when parting words were spoken
    Darling, you toyed with a toy heart

You played with my poor heart like a toy
That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended I hope this romance's ended
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart

 

Now darling my time will come some day
Time alone will heal my broken heart
The clouds will roll away, the sun will shine someday
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart

 

Now darling you know you've done me wrong
Your love for me has passed and gone
I'll find somebody new, I hope that they'll be true
Darling you toyed with a toy heartHere's the story of two childhood sweethearts
And the love that you shared still untold
How our simple little vows they were broken
And the love that I treasured more than gold

    Are you tired of the life that you're living
    Does your mind wander back to the past
    Do your think of the love you've forsaken
    Darling true love is too sweet to last

Alone in sadness I'm traveling
I'm lost on the sea of regret
Wandering back to the place of my childhood
And the one I've always loved the bestToo much Mountain dew
    Too much Mountain dew
    Dewey left a-drinking
    Too much Mountain dew

Now Dewey left this morning
Feeling oh so fine
With a jug in one hand
Drinking on his mind

 

Now the hottest sun was shining
While Dewey laid in the shade
Drinking from a bottle
Home brew that he made

 

Now drinking was a weakness
That he couldn't hide
Had one drink too many
Poor old Dewey diedToo much sorrow, too much pain
Too many reasons, not to go back again
Leaving without her, it's too much to bear
When we're together, too much nothing to share
Too much love, I've never seen
Too much love, I don't know what it means

Lot enough caring, too many lies
Sooner or later, one too many devidies
I've got no reason, for hanging around
And all my possessions, start to waiting me down
Too much love, I've never known
Too much love, I need some of my ownCome take me by my trembling hand
And hold me close to you
And think of all the days gone by
The day when love was true

    Come go with me to the old depot
    And wave your hand good-bye
    I know I've done you wrong sweetheart
    But now its too late to cry

Sweetheart of mine, I hate to go
And leave you here all alone
May God pretect and keep you
Wherever you may roamHang down your head Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster
You know you're bound to die

You took her on the hillside
As God almighty knows
You took her on the hillside
And there you hid her clothes

You took her by the roadside
Where you begged to be excused
You took her by the roadside
Where there you hid her shoes

You took her on the hillside
To make her your wife
You took her on the hillside
Where there you took her life

Take down my old violin
And play it all you please
At this time tomorrow
It'll be no use to me

I dug a grave four feet long
I dug it three feet deep
And throwed the cold clay o'er her
And tramped it with my feet

This world and one more than
Where do you reckon I'd be
If it hadn't been for Grayson
I'd a been in TennesseeToday I started loving you again
    I'm right back where I've really always been
    I got over you just long enough to let my hearteche mend
    Then today I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begunThrough thick and thin gonna sink or swim
To prove my love to you
And if I have to climb a mountain
Well that's what I'll do
I'd fight a bull like a matador
Laughin the face of a dinorour
I'd do anything you want me to
To prove my love t0 you

    Yes, to prove my love to you
    I'd swim the ocean blue
    Well, I'd wrestle blue box a kangaroo
    Just to prove my love to you

And to say that I don't have to do these things
To prove my love to you
Just hold you close, whisper low
That my love to you
If that's all there is for your love to win
Well, I'll take you now that I know I'm in
Cause I'd do anything that you want me to
To prove my love to you

  twiceAs I travel all this world
Just to soothe my movin' mind
And the messages I get
From a dear one left behind

They were filled with sweetest words
That so touched me when, I heard
Dear, oh dear, can I forget
These old somethings that she said

    Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or gloomy day
    Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
    Tis sweet to be remembered remembered, remembered
    Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far awayTimes are getting hard, boys, money's getting scarce
If times don't get much better, boy's going to leave this earth
Take my true love by the hand, lead her through the town
Say goodby to everyone goodby Sally Brown

Had a crop about a year ago, it withered to the ground
I tried to get some money but the banker turned me down
Take my Bible from the shelf, my shotgun from the wall
Take old Sal and hitch her up, the wagon for to haul

Put everything on the wagon, boys, so nothing can tumble down
Sal can pull and we can push, we're bound to leave this town
I'm going to California, where everything is green
I'm going to have the nicest farm that you have ever seenTill the end of the world rolls round, I'll keep on loving you
    And as long as the sun goes up it comes down
    Till the big sky comes down to the ground
    As long as the world goes round and round, I'll keep on loving you

I tried to sail the sea of life, I rowed my boat along
Your love meant nothing to me dear, my heart was made of stone
To a harbor filled with loneliness my little boat was moored
And then the day I first met you I fell right overboard

 

Whenever you're around me dear me dear my heart just won't be still
And when it comes to kissing you I'll never get my fill
They said I'd never settle down, that I would always roam
What I could never be the type for loving wife and home

 

So now I know the way I left was only selfish pride
I thought my heart was fireproof but you burned your way inside
So tell me what I've got to do and tell me how it stands
The cards are on the table dear my life is in you handsThis world is  not my home, I'm just-a-passing through
My pleasure and my hopes are placed beyond the blue
Many friends and kindred have gone on before
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Oh Lord you, know, I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home, oh Lord what will I do
Angels beckon me to heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world amymore

Over in gloryland there'll be no dying there
The saints all shouting victry and singing everywhere
I hear the voice of them that's gone on before
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

He's expecting me, htat's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago
He will take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home in this world anymoreThis train is for glory, this train

This train is bound for glory, this trainThere's an old, old house that once was a mansion
On a hill overlooking the town
But time has left a wreckage where once there was beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down

    But when leaves start to fall in autumn
    And the raindrops drip from the trees
    There's an old, old man who walks in the garden
    And his head is bowed in memories

They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
They planned to be married in the fall
But her love for him faded in the last days of summer
And the house stands empty after allI awoke this morning from a lovely dream
And looked about this lonely room of mine
Somewhere in the distance to me it seemed
Church bells were ringing this morning at nine

    Big tears I'm shedding all because of you
    I'm like a lonely prisioner serving his time
    Thinking of the day the days when love was true
    But you will wed another this morning at nine

My poor broken heart it started to cry
As I realized you never could be mine
Just then I remembered what day it really was
You were wedded another this morning at nineMy heart is breaking, and there's tears in my eyes
The heartaches you caused me, has wrecked my young life
The love that you promised, to me was untrue
All I have is a memory, I can't forget about you

    This lonesome old feeling, keeps hanging around me
    It reminds me of you, and the love that we knew
    I'll sit here alone, there's no one beside me
    With no love of my own, now that you're gone

The nights are so lonely, and you're still on my mind
I can't loose this memory, of you now I find
So I'll go on hurting and thinking of you
This lonesome old feeling, keeps making me blueIn a church on a mountain far far away
We vowed we'd never part
You kept your promise to honor and obey
But then I broke your heart

    And if you could see this misery
    I know that you'd come home to me
    There's no one else I'd rather have
    To have your love I'd be so proud to say
    This is the girl I love

What can I do dear, what can I say
To make you change your mind
If I could only have another chance
I'd never leave you behindMy lips will say goodbye to you tomorrow
I'll walk away pretend I feel no sorrow
But when you're out of sight I know I'll cry
For this heart of mine can never say goodbye 

    No this heart of mine can never say goodbye to you
    Even though, weetheart, these lips of mine will lie
    Though you'll leave my arms and walk away forever
    This heart of mine can never say goodbye

I'll never let you know how much it hurts me
Tomorrow when I see you my last time
I'll walk away and I won't even cry
But this heart of mine can never say goodbyeI saw the timber for the cabin floor
I build a plank fence out of locust boards
I work the corn rows in the early morn
And raise a family on a poor man's farm

    Thirty two acres of bottom land
    Bought and paid for with my own hands
    Worth a fortune to a working man
    Thirty two acres of bottom land

I planted a peach tree now the leaves are dying
I watered a grape vine, it's no longer mine
The country's taking everything I own
Cause it's on the right of way for a four lane road'Tis a sad but true story, from the Bible it came
And it tells us how Judas sold our Saviour in shame
He planned with the council of high priests that day
Thirty pieces of silver was the price they would pay

Thirty pieces of silver, thirty sheckles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus, on the cross he was slain
Betrayed and forsaken, unloved and unclaimed
In anger they pierced him, but he died not in vain

'Tis there on the hillside the multitude came
And found our dear Saviour, then took him away
They smote and they mocked him, thorns were crowned 'round his head
And his raiment of purple showed the bloodstation of red

Far off in the mountains with face toward the sun
Judas begged mercy for what he had done
He gave back the silver, for his heart filled with strife
Then there in the mountains he took his own lifeOh you told me once dear that you loved me
That we never no never could part
But the link in the chain has been broken
And I'm left with a sad and aching heart

    Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
    Who is sailing far over the sea
    Oh I'm thinking tonight of her only
    And I wonder if she ever thinks of me

It wouldn've been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world ever met
For the pleasure we've both seen together
I am sure we will never forget

 

Now you may have freinds on the ocean
And you may have some over the sea
But you'll travel this whole wide world over
And you'll never find a faithful friend like me

 

Like the birds that go out in the spring time
Just to wander for pleasure alone
While the sun shine is smiling upon them
But someday they return to their home

 

When the pleasures of life cease to call you
And you're done with your wine and your song
Then come back to your home in the mountains
To the girl who's been waiting so longNow as I sighs hours way
I think of yesterday
Now I know she's gonna a way
She's in heaven so the say


    Will the engels tell her for me
    That's my love will never die
    Someday I walk along beside her
    On the golden way up there

Now all I loved we live so galy
Until she had go away
Then she left me oh so londy
She lies at rest beneath the clay

 

Each night I think about dear
I wonder if you'll know me there
When I meet you upin heaven
We'll have life etenal thereIs it true I've lost you
    Am I not the only one
    After all this pain and sorrow
    Darling think of what you've done

Heart to heart dear how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Loving you has been my life, love
Can't believe we're really through

 

I'll go back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the sky
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I dieLook up, look down this lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry
For we often lose some thing in life
That make us wonder why

Oh, the fairest love I ever had
Now sleep beneath the clay
I live in hopes and dreams of her
We'll meet again some day

I often sit and wonder why
Life has to be this way
But after all is said and done
I'm sure God has his say

I'd like to be a smail part of life
With some few things to achieve
Just to know I've been a fruitless cause
Would make my poor heart grieve

Now when they lower my casket down
In some lonesome grave to rest
And you take your last look at my face
You can say I did my bestA story of two, they loved each other
More than anyone will know
But the girl she took the old consumption 
It broke the boy's heart you know

They carried her off to the mnountains
To try to gain her health you see
But listen all you good people
You can never cure old T.B

He often would to to the mountains
And sit upon his sweetheart's bed
But the saddest part of all the story
Now the boy too is deadGo down yonder Moses, down in the land of Egypt
Tell that old Pharoah, set my children free
Moses did obey, he set those children free

Climb upon the mountain, God told Abraham
Take your son and burn him, God told Abraham
Abraham did obey, and God gave him a ram

Go down to ther river, God told Lazareth
Dip yourself in Jordan, wash the spots away
Lazareth then obeyed, his spots were washed away

Take your horn and blow it, God told Joshue
The walls of Jericho they fell, God can have His way
Joshua then obeyed, God then had His wayWell the cows gone dry and the hens son't lay no place I can borrow
I give the landlord all the news and the rent comes due tomorrow
There's lost of money in the bank they say thats where they keep it
Not only wouldn't loan me aome but they wouldn't let me see it

    So pickaway on the old banjo
    And keep that guitar strumming
    Put more water in the soup
    There's better times a coming

Well Mary Lou could pull a plow if only I would let her
She's twice as strong as any oxbut looks a little better
I didn't kiss that Mary Lou but once and then I had to leave
Made my collar get to high and start that burning fever

 

My rooster use to chase the hens he just kept getting thinner
It's afraid he'd run himself to death so I brought him in for dinner
Yea cotton crops are mighty poor the weeds are really growin'
I need a woman pretty bad to help me with the hoeingThere's another baby waiting for me down the line
    She has got just what it takes and I have got the time
    And you have been untrue my darling to the tie that binds
    So there's another baby waiting for me down the line

I have stayed awak and wondered wondered what I'm gonna do
While you went out honky tonkin' coming home at two
But tonight I'm all dressed up and feeling Oh so fine
For there's another baby waiting for me down the line

 

I am not be at home my darling for a day or more
I'll give you just a little taste of walking the floor
You won't need me no longer since I've found out you're that kind
For there's another baby waiting for me down the lineWe all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone thru
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

    She lay on her death bed so bravely
    Her face all tired and worn
    We knew in our hearts she was leaving
    God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

 

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

 

When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
That there was nothing we could doFor years and years I've roamed this wide world over
Now my ramblin' and my roaming days are done
For the only friend I've left is my old dog Rover
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I gone

    There ain't gonna miss me when I gone
    There ain't gonna miss me when I gone
    So won't you write these words upon my tombstone
    There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone

Onece I had a loving mother dear and daddy
Now they're long since gone where angels dwell
They've found eternal life way up in heaven
Where I'll find muy reward no one can tell

 

I can't forget a little sweetheart I loved dearly
We had planned the day when she would be my own
But also another stole muy darling from me
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm goneWho did you say it was, brother
Who was it, fell by the way
When whiskey and blood run together
Did you hear anyone pray

    I didn't hear nobody pray dear brother
    I didn't hear nobody pray
    I heard the crash on the highway
    But I didn't hear nobody pray

When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stmped on my heart

 

There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death laid her hand in destruction
But I didn't hear nobody pray

 

I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody's life is now through

 

This soul has been called by the Master
They died in the crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying
But I didn't hear nobody prayWell, they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Saying Steve you are way behind time
This is not thirty eight, but it's old ninety seven
You must put her into Danville on time

He turned and said to his black greasy fireman
Just shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross the White Oak Mountain
You can watch old ninety seven roll

It's a mighty rough road from lynchburg to Daville
On a line on a three mile grade
It was on this grade that he lost his air-brakes
You can see what a jump he made

He was going down the grade makin' ninety miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
They found him in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
He was scalded to death by the steam

Now ladies, you must take warning
From this time now on learn
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband
He may leave you and never returnI thought I heard the voice of my darling
    I looked but there was no one else around
    Just when I knew her memory would haunt me
    Just as long as I stay in this lonesome town

As I go walking down this lonely street
Thinking of a love that used to be
The one I love is gone and I'm so lonely
Then I thought I heard my baby speak to me

 

Is seems so long now since she went away
Although it was only yesterday
I see her face each time I try to sleep
And I hear her voice on every honely streetThere's an old broken lock on the old cabin door
The cracks and the holes in your cabin floor
It's a tumbled down shack, how I long to go back
And dwell in that shack evermore

    Peace, peace the valley of peace
    Where no sorrows are known
    Like a heaven, yes heaven to me it seems
    Peace, the valley my home

Though an old broken window, the light brightly shines
It twinkles and shines through the honeysuckle vines
By the old rustic well is my sweet little Nell
And for me I know how she pines

 

In the parlor a fire is burning so bright
The old rocking chair is empty tonight
That tumbled down shack is a palace to me
And that's where I'm longing to beO they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
O they tell me of a home far away
O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
O they tell me of an unclouded day

    O they land of cloudless day, O they land of an unclouded sky
    O they tell me of a home where no storm clouds  rise
    O they tell me of an unclouded day

O they tell me of a home where my friends have gone
O they tell me that land far away
Where the tree of life in eternal bloom
Shed its fragrance thru the unclouded day

 

O they tell me of the King in his beauty there
And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
Where he sits on the throne that is whiter than snow
In that city that is made of gold

 

O they tell me that he smiles on his children there
And his smile drives their sorrows all away
And they tell me that no tears ever come again
In that lovely land of unclouded skyWas in the Spring we met each other
And by chance a seed was sown
Now it's five years we've been together
And our love, how big it's grown

    And you're the one who wears my ring
    And these hard times don't mean a thing
    I may be poor but I'm a king
    You are the sweetest song I sing

Well no one knows the love we have, dear
How two hearts can beat as one
Your smiling eye and way of kissing
A loving touch when day is done

 

Some people plan for the future
They build a house and they save their pay
They need a sign to go on living
But I know a better way

 
I may be poor but I'm a king
You are the sweetest song I singI'm going away for to leave you, love
I'm going away for a while
But I'll return to you some time
If go ten thousand miles

    The storms are on the ocean
    The heavens may cease to be
    This world may lose its motion love
    If I prove false to thee

Now, who will shoe your pretty little feet
And who will grove your hands
Who will kiss your red rosy cheek
Till I come back again

 

Pappa will shoe my pretty little feet
Momma will glove my hands
And you can kiss my red rosy cheeks
When you return again

 

See that lonesome turtle dove
As he files from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just the way I mourn for mine

 

I'll never go back on the ocean, love
I'll never go back on the sea
I'll never go back on the blue eyed girl
Till she goes back on meThe city now is sleeping, its coast has slowed down
The streets are all deserted, they've almost lost their sound
I've walked the lonely sidewalk, my heart way down deep
But the only sound that I hear is the shuffle of my feet

I stare into a window my mind is miles away
Your face is everywhere I go, I can't live on this way
A red light slows my progress, then I cress the street
But the only sound that I hear is the shuffle of my feet

I came up to a small cafe and entered into the gloom
I remember how many times we sat together in this room
I couldn't stand it any longer
I stumbled blindly into the street
Tears came down, but the only sound was the shuffle of my feet

Was the shuffle of my feet, was the shuffle of my feetThe path is narrow all the way
But yet I hear my Savior say
Come with me, your soul I'll bless
In that home above, I'll give you rest

    Oh, the shining path leads up to Heaven
    But you must travel it all alone
    And to those who walk the shining pathway
    Oh, the gates will open when you reach that home

I'm in htat shining path at last
Oh, I can see my Savior's face
Oh, I've been saved by Him today
By His ever loving grace

 

The path is awful hard to trod
But you must put your trust in God
Your path will brighten all the way
In that fair home we'll meet some day'Twas an afternoon in springtime
Folk were happy everywhere
Preparing for a joyous evening
Never dreaming death was near
To a little country schoolhouse
Neighbors thinking they would go
They would have a jolly evening
At the children's little show

You could hear those children singing
Voices ringing clear and sweet
Never dreaming in their joy
Of the fate that they would meet

But their joys all were blighted
They began to scream and rage
When a lantern fell that evening
Streaming fire upon the stage
It was on that fatal evening
They could not control the fire
They madly lashed about for freedom
But they perished in the fire

You could hear those children scremaming
While the flames were rolling high
Daddy, come and get your babies
Will you stand and let us die

All the fathers they were trying
To their little ones to go
But the brave old fellows perished
In the chaos from the show
LIttle children they were trampled
In that mighty rolling flame
Others on that night were screaming
Death was dealing just the same

There's a lonely spot in Cleveland
Nicely fenced around and eired
Ther's a monument erected
Tells the story of the fireEvery man that I ever have known
Says the road gets a little bit longer
Every woman that I've ever loved

    Told me so, told me so
    Told me there's so much more to go

Little boy with the pretty brown eyes
Knows the road gets a little bit longer
Every man that I've ever loved

 

There's a friend who left today
Says the load got a little bit stronger
And his mind couldn't face the gainWay back in the hills when a boy I once wandered
Buried deep in the grave lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth a jewel for heaven
More pricious than diamonds more precious than gold

    Ajewel here on earth, a jewel in heaven
    She'll brighten the kingdom around God's Great Throne
    May the angels have peace, God bless her in heaven
    They've broken my heart and they've left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to heraven one night

 

This world has its wealth it's trials and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can't hold the soul of one precious jewel
She is resting in peace with the heavenly foldThere's an old and faded picture on he wall
It's been hanging there for many years
Tis a picture of my Mother and I know there is no other
That can take the place of Mother on the wall

    On the wall, on the wall
    How I love that dear old picture on the wall
    Time is swifty passing by and I'll bow my head and cry
    Cause I know I'll meet my Mother after all

How the children all have scattered off and gone
And I have a little family of my own
And I love them well, more than any tongue can tell
But I love that dear old picture on the wall

 

Yes I loved that dear old Mother's years ago
There has been no one to take her place I know
As my banjo plays its chord, I am praying to the Lord
To bless that dear old picture on the wallListen poor sinner you're drifting away
From the dear Saviour who's pleading today
What will you do when the Saviour comes nigh
When the pale horse and his rider go by

The time now ain't long when the Saviour will come
Then you'll be judged for the deeds you have done
On that judgment day you'll weep and you'll cry
When the pale horse and his rider go by

Soften your heart and trun from all sin
Jesus is waiting to welcome you in
There's coming a time you'll wish He was nigh
When the pale horse and his rider go by

Won't you redeem you poor wicked soul
You can't pay your way with ailver and gold
If you're not saved you'll be lost in the night
When the pale horse and his rider go byThere's an old, old house
that once was a mansion
On a hill overlooking the town
But time has left a wreckage
Where once there was beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down

    But when the leaves start to fall in autumn
    And the raindrops drip from the trees
    There's an old old man
    Who walks in the garden
    And his head is bowed in memories

They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
They planned to be married in the fall
But her love for him faded in the last days of summer
And the house stands empty after allTonight my heart is lonely for the folks back home
Where I left my mother and daddy all alone
I've seen a lot lf changes there since I been around
I'd like to wander back to the old home town

    You'll never miss the home folks until you've gone away
    And then you'll need a friend to help you every day
    And then you call on mother and she won't be around
    I'd like to wander back to the old home town

I've searched this whole world over since I've been around
I've never found a place just like the old home town
If I could live life over I'd never roam around 
I'd like to wander back to the old home townThere are many paths through this world of sin
But there's only one I will travel in
'Tis the old cross road, on the way called straight
There's just one way to the pearly gate

    There's just one way to the pearly gate
    To the crown of life and the freinds who wait
    It's the old cross road or the way called straight
    There's just one way to the pearly gate

There are some who sneer at the old cross road
At the pearly gates and the streets of gold
Yet I mind them not, but with happy song
And assurance sweet, I press along

 

Other risk their soul on some new made way
Thinking they will reach the gates some day
May they find out 'ere life is done
That the old cross road is the only oneI was just a lad nearly twenty-one
When they put me on the chain gang for things I had done
Swinging that pick and shovel all day long
And wondering if my baby was a-doing me wrong

The sun was shining down, the sweat a-rolling off of me
chains on my legs keep a-pulling at me
Guards a-watching me with a big shot gun
Just a-waiting on me to take a chance and run

Well the boss man went on a drunk one day
I pulled my chain to where that old axe lay
I took that axe and I cut my chain
And I said bye, bye to the old chain gangThe night I got saved I went to church with my dad
And all of a sudden this strange feeling I had
I fell on my knees and how I did pray
For Jesus to save me take my sins away

    The night I got saved I saw Calvary
    I could see Jesus hanging as he died on the tree
    I could see drops of blood and the pain on his face
    No one but my Savior, no one took his place

His hands were all bruised, bleed flowed down his side
With thorns on his head my Savior then died
But the third day my Jesus did rise from the grave
I visioned these things the night I got savedMany times I've seen it happen I never dreamed I'd live to see
The time htat I would pray to die so my soul would set me free
You see I have the habit to the needle I'm a slave
From the bottle to the needle from the needle to the grave

Just a crazy youngster I was looking for my fun
That night I met the pusher is when the misery begun
When he offered me the needle and the stuff that I now crave
From the bottle to the needle from the needle to the grave

Time passes so slowly as it passes I get worse
And as time goes by again I'll try my best to chase the curse
But it seems I have no power against the needle that I crave
From the bottle to the needle from the needle to the grave

Many times you've seen us on the streets down in the slum
These men who've lost the way of life and every feeling grown numb
But in our shame we are all the same to the needle we are slaves
From the bottle to needle from the needle to the graveI'm walking from one bar to another
I don't know where I'm going or where I've been
No one I meet realized
I'm trying when I know I can't win

    The memory of your smile, it nearly drives me wild
    Ain't nothing ever gonna ease my mind
    I thought you'd true, I couned so on you
    I'm lost from a love I'll never find

I wonder how this pain is going to wind up
It gets worse day by day since you're gone
If only you would come back and see me
You're my only chance from now onThree men on the mountain up Calvary
    And the man in the middle was Jesus
    He died for you and me

Well the man on the left was a sinner man
Tied to the cross he bled
He could have been forgiven
But he mocked the Lord instead

Well you say you are the son of God
But they nailed you to that tree
Come on, come down and save us
If God your father beThe Lord's last supper served in honor of our king
He knew his time was drawing night
He knew that he would make a greater sacrifice
He knew his time had come to die

    The time had come when he would die to free the world
    A world he loves so lost in sin
    The blessed promis that he left for you and me
    I go out soon I'll come again

The twelve disciples were all tathered by his side
The blessed  hrist of calvary
He told them how to carry on his work for God
He blessed them with his spirit free

 

He knew that night someone would sell his precious soul
One of the twelve he loved so dear
He then told Judas quickly to go on his way
He knew the time of death was nearThe longer you wait to leave me
The longer I'll hurt when you're gone
And the longer it takes you to break my heart
The longer the pain lingers on

    How long will you prolong my misery
    Wish I could leave on my own
    Cause the longer you wait to leave me
    The longer I'll hurt when you're gone

We both knew that you never loved me
I lied to myself from the start
And we both knew that some day you'd leave me
And to know just tears me apartWay down in a lone green valley
Down where the roses bloom and fade
There was a jealous lover
In love with a beautiful maid

One night the moon shone brightly
The stars were shining, too
And to this maiden's cottage
The jealous lover drew

Come, love, and we will wander
Where the woods are gay
While strolling, we will ponder
Upon our wedding day

So on and on they wandered
The night bird sang above
The jealous lover grew angry
With the beautiful girl he loved

Down on her knees before him
She pleaded for her life
But deep into her bosom
He plunged the fatal knife

Oh, Willie, won't you tell me
Why have you taken my life
You know I've always loved you
And wanted to be your wife

I never have deceived you
But with my dying breath
I will forgive you, Willie
And close my eyes in deathOur darling wandered far away
While she was out at play
Lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
She was our darling girl
The sweetest thing in the world
We searched for her but she couldn't be found

    I heard the screams of our little girl far away
    Hurry daddy there's an awful dreadful snake 
    I ran as fast as I could though the dark and dreary woods
    But I reached our darling girl too late

Oh, I began  to sigh, I knew that soon she'd havce to die
For the snake was warning me close by
I held her close to my face she said Daddy kill that snake
It's getting dark tell Mommy goodbye

 

To all parents I must say don't let your children stray away
They need your love to fuide them along
Oh, God, I pray we'll see our darling someday
It seems we still can hear her voice around our homeI've seen the sky blood red at sunset
I've seen the mountains they're shining with dew
I've seen the trees in autumn splendor
I've seen it all but I've never seen the likes of you

    I've never touched a hand so gentle
    I can't imagine eyes of deeper hue
    I've never seen a smile so mellow
    I've seen beauty in my time but I've never seen the likes of you

I've seen the sands of the burning desert
I've seen the river flowing peaceful and blue
I've seen the rocks of the wind swept canyon
I've seen it all but I've never seen the likes of youIs there any mail for me was the question that he asked
Of the postman at the closing of the day
But he turned away and cried while the tears stood in his eyes
As he drooper his head and slowly walked away

    Was it from a gray haired Mother or a Sister or a Brother
    He waited all these many years in vain
    Of't from early morning light he would wait till dark of night
    For a letter but alas it never came

As he waited all these years joy mingled with his tears
His poor soul had fleeted out with the time
In his hand he held a note and those simple words he wrote
If your letter comes just place it by my sideI wrote you a letter sweetheart
    I wrote you a letter in sorrow
    It never go mailed that heart of mine faile
    And it wrecked my hope tomorrow

In past days I've grown dear to love you
With the love we both need so bad
The good lord above made me fall in love
But I wish that he never had

 

I should have mailed you that letter
I still wish so bad that you knew
Maybe some day when tears got in the way
Then I'll break down and tell youI was standing by the window yesterday morning
Without a thought of worry or of care
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway
With such a happy look and jolly air

Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited
And then he said, Good morning to you, Jack
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me a letter edged in black

With trembling hand I took the letter from him
I broke the seal and this is what it said
Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you
Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead

The last words that your mother ever uttered
Tell my boy I want him to come back
My eyes were blurred, my poor old heart is breaking
As I'm writing you this letter edged in black

I bow my head in sorrow and in silence
The sunshine of my life it all has fled
Since the postman brought that letter yesterday morning
Saying come home, my boy, your poor old mother's dead

Those angry words I wish I'd never spoken
You know I never meant them, don't you, Jack
May the angels bear me witness, I am asking
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black

I could hear the postman whistling yesterday morning
Coming down the pathway with his pack
But he little know the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me that letter edged in blackYour letter came to me this morning
I've read it o'er one hundred times
Each time the words come back to haunt me
And the burning tears along each line

    You wrote, I love you and I need you
    Without your love I just can't live
    I'll do anything to please you
    For I've got so much love to give

I relive each precious moment
As I read each tear stained line
I feel your gentle arms around me
Your warm sweet lips pressed close to mineFor a long time now I've been trying to make a go
Pickin' and a-singin' on a country show
I traveled far with a little bit of pay
I sowed a lot of oats, I didn't make much hay
I've been down-hearted enough to quit
Somehow I never have until yet
I'm gonna quit this picking, don't have a dime
It's always wait until the next time

    And this is the last song I'll sing
    The last one I'm ever gonna write
    The last song I'm ever gonna play
    Oh, this old guitar on this old stage tonight

When I think I'll quit and never play no more
Some long haired guy krocks on my door
It don't take long til I'm back on the go
Cause one of his clowns couldn't make the show
We live in cheap hotels and ride big fine cars
Rear way back and smoke a long cigar
The steaks we eat are the ground up kind
But they hold me over just one more time

 

Our hopes are high for that one break
For that and magic is all it'll take
The lonesome sound, the sweet Fraulein
Take me back just one more time
Makes it hard to quit as the days go round
I don't want to steal when the sun goes down
When I hear George sing Out of my mind
I gotta try again just one more timeWhy do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so bitter and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when we are withered and old

I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you'll only say that you'll forever be mine
Think of the heartaches, the pain and suffering you'll save

While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
But to this old world, I'll soon bid my farewell at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from meJohnson boys were raised in the ashed in the ashes
Didn't know how to court a maid
Turn their backs and hide their faces
Sight of a pretty girl makes 'em afraid
Sight of a pretty girl makes 'em afraid
Sight of a oretty girl makes 'em afraid

Johnson boys they went a-huntin'
Took two dags and went astray
Tore their clothes and scratched their faces
Didn't come home till break of day
Didn't come home till break of day
Didn't come home till break of day

Johnson boys they went a-courtin'
Coon creek girl so pretty and sweet
They couldn't make no comversation
They didn't know to put their feet
They didn't know to put their feet
They didn't know to put their feetWell, I wonder how the old folks are at home
Well, I wonder if they miss me while I roam
I wonder if they pray for the boy who went away
And left his dear old parents all alone

    You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
    You could see the bluegrass where I used to roam
    You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their boy goodbye
    I wonder how the old folks are at home

Just a village and a homestead on the farm
And a mother's love to shield you from all harm
A mother's love so true, and a sweetheart brave and true
A village and homestead on the farmThe late to feel sorrow too late to feel pain
He's just an old hobo and lost out in the rain
He'll never cause trouble so don't have no fear
He's just an old hobo and he'll soon be far away from here

    He used to be a gambling man just like you
    Until the asnk so low there was nothing you know for him to do

Well,don't make him ask you no don't make him beg
He was a war hero and that's how he hurt his leg
Well, he killed thirty Injuns with one cannon ball
Now he's just an old hobe asleep out in the hall

 

A wife and five children who live in L.A
Oh, they miss their dear daddy who's gone so fara way
But they still have his picture it's hung on the wall
And he's just an old hobo asleep out in the hallOne I had a darling sweetheart
And she thought the world of me
Untill another man persuaded
And she cares no more for me
I don't want your green back dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you, my darling

Many a time we strolled together
Down beside the deep blue sea
Now in your heart you love another
In my grave I'd rather be
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is my big long pistol
To blow out your dirty brains

You said I could not marry
Mama said it would never do
But if you ever learn to love me
I will run away with you
I don't want your green back dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you, my darling
Won't you take me back againOh they built ship Titanic to sall the ocean blue
And they thought they had a ship that the water would never go thru
But the Lord's Almighty hand knew that ship would never land
It was sad when great ship went down

    It was sad - It was sad
    It was sad when the great ship went down
    Husbands and wives, little children lost therir lives
    It was sad when that great ship went down

Oh, they sailed from England and were almost to the shore
When the rich refused to associate with the poor
So they put them down below where they were the first to go
It was sad when the great ship went down

 

The boat was full of sin, and the sides about to burst
When the captain shouted, a-women and children first
Oh, the captain tried to wire, but the lines were all on fire
It was sad when the great ship went down

 

Oh, they swung the lifeboats out o'er the deep and ragin' sea
When the band struck up with a-nearer My God to thee
Little children wept and cried as the waves swept o'er the side
It was sad when the great ship went downWhat a beautiful throught I am thinking
Concerning the great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word

There are many who'd lower her standards
And they watch every move that she makes
They just want to find fault with her teachings
Tho they search, they can find no mistakes

Where He comes on a cloud in the morning
And his voice around the earth shall be heard
Oh, Iwant to be ready to meet him
And go up on the Great speckled birdI've been sitting here thinking back over my life
All of the good thing the trouble and strife
Well my share of heartaches yes so many I've had
But I still think the good things outweigh the bad 

    Well I've rocked my babies at night when they'd cry
    I've seen the teardrops turn into smiles
    And that's when I realize all the bad luck I've had
    And I know all the good things outweigh the bad

Well I've never had riches or money to spare
Just a share croppers wages is my only fare
Yes making my living just working the land
But I still think the good things outweigh the bad

 

Yes I worked the cotton in the heat of the day
And then paid the landlord nearly all that I'd made
Well I've seen high wages take all that I had
But I still think the good things outweigh the badThe girl I love don't pay me no mind
    The girl I love don't pay me no mind
    Oh sweetheart divine put your little hand in mine
    The girl I love don't pay me no mind

The girl I love done left this town
The girl I love done left this town
She left this town says I'm Alabama bound
The girl I love done left this town

 

When I'm gone don't wear no black
When I'm gone don't wear no black
Oh don't wear no black for you know I'll be back
When I'm gone don't wear no blackOn a morning bright and clear to my old home that I drew near
Just a village down in sunny Tennessee
I'd been speeding on the train that would bring me back again again
To that girl I left in sunny Tennessee

    I could hear those voices singing as she bid farewell to me
    Far across the fields of cotton my old hopes that I could see
    As the moon rose in its glory then I told my saddest story
    Of that girl I left in sunny Tennessee

Now the train drew up at last old familar scene's had passed
And I kissed my mother at the station door
Then kind friends that gathered round tears on every face I found
There I missed the one that I'd been waiting for

 

I just whispered mother dear where is Mary she's not here
all the world seemed dark and sadness came to me
She just pointed to the spot in that little church yard lot
Where my sweetheart sleeps in sunny TennesseeAs I walked in the Wayside Tavern
The smell of drink was in the air
I threw my money on the counter
this pretty maid was standing there

My thoughts theydrifted so far from me
As I liiked upon her lovely face
I knew she was my kind of woman
No one could ever take her place

I said when working hours are over
I would just love to take you home
She said young man that is a pleasure
And soon we found ourselves alone

And then our arms went around each other
I felt a knofe stick in her back
She turned and saw her lover running
And said his name was Barnum Jack

She did not know her lover followed
She did not know he was around
Until the fate of death had struck her
And now she sleeps beneath the ground

I sit alone tonight in prison
My thoughts are of the one so fair
That I met that night in the Wayside Tavern
When the smell of drink was in the airI struck the trail in seventy-nine
The herd strung out behind me
As I jogged along my mind went back
To the girl I left behind me

    That sweet little gal, that true little gal
    That gal I left behind me
    That sweet little gal, that true little gal
    That gal I left behind me

If I ever get off the train
And the Indians they don't find me
I'll make my way straight back again
To the gal I left behind me

 

The wind did blow, the rain did flow
The hail did fall and blind me
I thought of that gal, that sweet little gal
That gal I'd left behind me

 

She wrote ahead to the place I said
I was always glad to find it
She says, I'm true, when you get through
Ride back and you will find me

 

When we sold out, I took the train
I know when I would find her
When I got back, we had a smack
And that was no gol-darned liarI trusted you dear, what more can I say
How heartbreak and tears is the price I mist pay
But weeping will heal a soul in deepair
And there'll come a time when I'll no longer care

You started a flame, a fire in my heart
I thought you'd be true that we never would part
You left me alone and through the long years
The fire in my heart will be drowned out with tears

In this game of love what chances we take
For each heart that's left there another must break
You smile at me dear, I played and I lost
It's all over now and I'm counting the costs

I can't face our friends, the ones we both knew
For they always ask, whats happened to you
I'll go on somehow and hope for the day
The love in my heart will be all washed away

I wonder if you are happy sweetheart
Or do you regret that we're living apart
Come back if you wish but sweetheart return
While deep in my heart that old flame still burnsI left my old home to remember this country
My mother and dad said son don't go wrong
Remember that God will always watch oe'r you
And we will be waiting for you here at home

    Son don't go astray is what they both told me
    Remember that love for God can be found
    But now they're both gone this letter just told me
    For years they've been dead, the fields have turned brown

For many long years I've rambled in sorrow
No thoughts of the day when I would return
Now as I go home and find no one waiting
The price I have paid to live and to learnWhen the fiddler has played his last tune for the night
And the singer has sung his last song
And the mandolins and guitars and banjo's are quiet
And the loud noisy crowd has gone home

    Theres nothing as quiet as a night with no music
    Or as dark as night with no stars
    And nothing as lonesome as a cold lonely river
    Just wondering all night where you are

As we walked together the music was playing
The wind whispered soft through the tree
With your arms around me whispered I love you
And the words seemed to float on the breeze

 

Now the fiddler has played his last tune for the night
And the singer has sung his last song
All the mandlins and guitars and banjo's are quiet
Like the music sweetheart you are goneI went into a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all their books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible, when they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a finger print was plain

    Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
    The words of all our prophets and the sayings of our Lord
    Of all the other books you'll find there's none salvation holds
    Get that dust off the Bible, and redeem your poor your soul

You can read your magazines, read of love and tragfic things
But not one word of Bible verse, not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth, and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered o'er it, it is sure to doom your soul

 

If you have a friend you'd like to help along life's way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible, crade the wrong way for the rightIt was on one dark and starless night
I heard and saw an awful sight
The lighting flshed and the thunder roader roared
All around ther drunkard's feet

I started home to change my life
To see my long neglected wife
I found her kneeling by her bed
She said our darling girl is dead

I took her by her trembling hand
She was so weak she could not stand
On bended knee I prayed a prayer
That God might save and protect us there

Who preached like paul who once did say
Our sins have all been washed away
Let whiskey stay as far from me
As the mountain did from the deep blue seaThe cuckoo is a funny bird, ahe sings as she flies
She'll bring you glad tidings, she'll tell you no lies
She sips from the pretty flowers to make her voice clear
And she'll never sing cuckoo till the spring of the year

A-walking and a-talking, and a-wonderling go I
A-walking for my true love, he'll come by and by
I'll meet him in the morning for he's all mu delight
I could walk with my true love from morning to night

Come all you fair maidens, take warning from me
Don't place your affection on a young man too free
For leaves they do wither, and roots they do die
And your love he will leave you and he'll never say why

But if he will leave me, I'll not be forlorn
And if he'll forswear me, I'll not be forsworn
I'll get myself up in my best finery
And I'll walk as proud by him as he walks by meThe code of the mountain, way down in the backwoods
The code of the mountain, the unwritten law
There Harry and Joe Brown, way down in the backwoods
There Harry and Joe Brown, shot Charlie Mcbraw

They caught him at daybreak, way down in the backwoods
They caught him at daybreak, sown on his knees
He pleaded for mercy, way down in the backwoods
He pleaded for mercy, heed to my pleas

Said Harry to Charlie, way down in the backwoods
Said Harry to Charlie, you thought you were sly
The code of the mountains, way down in the backwoods
The code of the mountains, says you must die

He loaded his rifle, way in the backwoods
He loaded his rifle, Joe loaded up too
One shot and another, wat down in the backwoods
The code of the mountains, is the only law there

They buried poor Charlie, way down in the backwoods
They buried poor Charlie, without any prayer
The code of the mountains, way down in the backwoods
The code of the mountains, is the only law there

Deep in the earth now, down in the backwoods
Deep in the earth now, lies Charlie Mcgraw
For the code of the mountains, way down in the backwoods
The code of the mountains is the unwritten lawThere's a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovlier place in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale

    Oh, come to the church by the wildwood
    Oh, come to the church in the dale
    No spot is so dear to my childhood
    As the little brown church in the vale

How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To list to the clear ringing bell
It's tones so sweetly are calling
Oh, come to the church in the vale

 

There, close by the church in the valley
Lies one htat I love so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the vale

 

There, closs by the side of that loved one
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymn shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tombWhat memories come back to me
As I ponder o'er the years passed away
If I could be back in that old country church
And once more hear the parson say

    We've travelled on together
    Though dark and sunny days
    And may we always be together
    Just my Lord and I along the way

I can see the service now ending
And the parson's voice is raised
In solemn quiet benediction
Upon our different waysIn the hills of old Virginia there's a mountain
Where the trees still bud so pretty in the spring
Where I met and fell in love with one so sweetly
Joy and gladness to my heart she then did bring

Underneath a beech nut tree there in the mountains
Where we met and told each other of our love
There we promised to each other we would marry
As the little birds sang sweetly up above

This is one song that had a happy ending
For we're married now and in her eyes I see
All the love and Oh, how sweetly she remembers
Where we made our vows beneath the beech nut treeSweetheart I recall the day I first met you
I wonder if you remember the same
We talked of the love we shared for each other
And longed for the day we'd change your sweet name

    Oh, I can still hear your voice in the evening
    I see your sweet face your blue eyes so bright
    God took you away and left me so lonely
    The angels are singing in heaven tonight

As the years passed away we cherished each other
No worries or cares to darken our day
From our little home up in the Clinch Mountains
The saviour came down and called you one day

 

I'll always be true and love you, my darling
But I know you are happy and healthy up there
When God calls me home I'll meet you in heaven
Please wait for me, darling, I'll meet you up thereSee that star up yonder mister
    Shining down that the whole wide might see
    That's my daddy there in heaven
    And that star belongs to me

My daddy died over yonder in a land across the sea
And he left me and mommy alone and here are we
I promised to be a good girl, stay with mommy every day
But I get so lonesome for daddy that's why to you I say

 

I pray each night and morning for daddy and mammy and me
Some day we'll be together once again like we used to be
Some day I'll see my daddy and we'll walk the streets of gold
With mommy we'll be so happy once again to you I'll sayI'll never forget the day that I was born
It was on a cold and frosty winter morn
The doctor said I was a chubby chap
And when the nurse she took me on her lap

Oh she bathed me all over I remember
And after powder puffing me you see
She put me in a cradle near the window
In that little shirt my mother made for me

The first day I wore my knicker frocks
I felt so funny agter wearing frocks
I looked a little picture they did say
But when they left me out to run and play

Oh I didn't like the pants that I was wearing
So in the street I took them off you see
And I started walking home so brave and daring
In that little shirt my mother made for me

And then to school they said that I must go
I didn't like my teacher you must know
And when I played the truant quite so dear
The teacher said now boy you come here

With a big stick she beat around upon me
There's no mistake about my pedigree
I had the map of Scotland painted on me
Neath that little shirt my mother made for meLike April can count on the showers
The grass can count on the dew
And March can count on the wind wind windy days
That's how I can count on you

If the road looks long and endless
With nothing but heartbreak in view
I'll smile all the while for I'll ,I'll, I'll
Know that I can always count on you

    If fame and fortune pass me by
    Though a begger, I stand alone
    For a king and his Kingdom could never find
    A love as true as the love we've once known

Like a baby can count on his mother
At night when the day is all through
Lovers can count on the moon, moon, silvery moon
That's how I can count on youOh that home above so far away
That's where we pray we'll live someday
In that home above beyond the starlight sky
Where the souls of man will never die

    I'm ready to leave this world below
    To the home above I'm ready to go
    Dad and mother will say welcome home our son
    In our heavenly home your life just begun

Oh my mother and dad have gone before
They're waiting for me on heaven's shore
I long to see and shake their hands
When I'm safe at home as they had planned

 

Oh that beautiful land where we never die
That's where my soul shall rest on high
I'll sing and shout for his face I've seen
And with God I'll rest to eternityThanks of all the yesterday
Memories are all I need any way
They'll guide me whn I'm lonely every step of the way
Thanks for all the yesterday

    The first time I met you, oh what a surprise
    To feel love and to see love reflected in your eyes
    But time and not love has played the biggest part
    For us there's no tommorrow just a pair fo broken heart

 
  Thanks for all the yesterdayAlong about eighteen twenty five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would have forded the Arkansas flood
If I hadn't been a-rideng on the Tennessee stud

    The Tennessee stud was long and lean
    The color of the sun and his eyes were green
    He had the nerve and he had the blood
    And there never was a house like the Tennessee stud

I had a little trouble withe my sweetheart's pa
And one of her brohters was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

 

We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed that river called the Rio Grand
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foal
Till I got away on the Tennessee stud

 

Me and a gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns and he fell with a thud
And I got way on the Tennessee stud

 

I got just as lonesome as a man could be
Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
Cause he was a-dreaming of his sweetheart too

 

We loped right back across Arkansas
I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a-riding on the Tennessee mare

 

Stirrup to stirrup and side byu side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We come to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
On the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee stud

 

A pretty little baby on the cabin floor
A little horse colt playing round the door
I love that girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mareHe looks like skin on a bone pile
A cat wouldn't give him a chance
But When he stretches his long legs out
A fox ain't got a cahnce
Tennessee hound dog Tennessee hound dog

Sad faced mooneyed creature
His ears hang down to his knees
The she hounds call him a has been
An old aged home for fleas
Tennessee hound dog Tennessee hound dog

But when he gets a certain kind of look on his face
The she hounds run for a hiding place
Cuz when he takes a notion all the girl dogs know
He's a dynamite up tite outa sight backyard romeo

He leeks like ugly warmed over
Some dog lovers have said that
But he's got more sense in the end of his nose
That they've got in their head
Tennessee hound dog Tennessee hound dogI'm a Tennessee truck driving man
    Tennessee truck driving man
    I packed the load and I know the road
    I'm a Tennessee truck driving man

I leave the terminal loaded
Heading for the eastern seaboard
There ain't a thing between me and the end of the run
But this highway, this truck and my load

 

I keep the long haul steady
Making my stops on the run
Then I'll break her down, turn her around
To get back to my home base on timeYou have heard and read about the state of Tennessee
Down in the southern state is where I want to be
Where the valleys are so green and the mountains are so tall
You will know just what I mean when you hear them say You all

    Tennessee, (Tennessee)
    I hear you calling me (I hear you calling me)
    The home of Davy Crockett in the hills of Tennessee

When I was a little boy around the folks back home
My mother always said to me, Jimmy, please don't roam
Now that I have gone away my heart is full of woe
When I think of Mom and Dad, that's where I want to go



If ever I get back to that state of Tennessee
I tell you there'll be no more roaming for me
There lives a sweetheart who said she'd marry me
As soon as I get back to that state of TennesseeRun oh Molly run, run oh Molly run
Tenbrooks gonna beat you to the bright and shining sun
Bright and shining sun, oh Lordy, bright and shining sun

Tebrooks was a big bay horse, rode that shaggy mane
Run all around Memphis, and he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train, oh lordy, beat the Memphis train

Tenbrooks said to Molly, what makes your head so red
Running in the got sun with fever in your head
Fever in your head, oh lordy, fever in your head

Molly said to Tenbrooks, you're looking mighty squirel
Tenbrooks said to Molly, I'm leaving this old world
Leaving this old world, oh lordy, leaving this old world

Women's all a-laughing, children all a-crying
Men all a-hollering, old Tenbrooks is flying
Old Tenbrooks is flying, oh lordy, old Tenbrooks is flying

Out in California, where Molly done as she pleased
Back to old Kentucky, got beat with all ease
Got beat with all ease, oh lordy, got beat with all ease

Kiper, Kiper, Kiper, you're not riding right
Molly's beating old Tenbrooks clear out of sight
Clear out of sight, oh lordy, clear out of sight

Kiper, Kiper, Kiper, my son
Give Tenbrooks the bridle and let old Tenbrooks run
Let old Tenbrooks run, oh lordy, let old Tenbrooks run

Go and catch old Tenbrooks and hitch him in the shade
We're gonna bury old Molly on a coffin ready made
In a coffin ready made, oh lordy, in a coffin ready madeTen Years or more I've waited
For you to change your ways
But starting today it's all over
The price is more than I can pay

Ten Years seems like ten million
I've knelt at your command
But now it's too late things are different
The price is more than I can stand

Ten lonesome years filled with heart aches
For me is what you planned
But I've had enough so I'm leaving
The price is more than I can stand

The past will soon be forgotten
I'll find a new love so grand
Now it's too late it's all over
Ten Years is more than I can standHe was standing by the highway
With a sign that says just Mother
When he heard a driver coming
About a half a mile away
So he held the sign up higher
So no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by Boulder Dam that day

He was raised up in Milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singing songs about the rambling
The loving girls and gambling
How the world fell on his shoulder
Back in Boulder, I don't know

Well it was out in Arizona
And he heard the lady listening
To each word that he was saying
To each line that he would write
So he sat down by her table
And they talked about the weather
98.6 and rising down
By Boulder Dam that night

And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the morning sun
Back in Boulder he had told her
I don't know when I've had a better friend

Now he's traded off his Martin
But his troubles and not over
His feet are almost frozen
And the sun is sinking low
Won't you listen to me brother
If you ever loved your mother
Please pull off on the shoulder
If you're going Milwaukee way

It's ten degrees and getting colder
Down by Boulder Dam todayA little tot was playing one night upon the floor
Her mother sat and id'ly watched the little girl of four
All at once she dropped her toys and tears beging to shed
She climbed upon her mother's knee and this is what she said

    Tell my why my daddy don't come home
    I know that I am much to big to cry
    Why don't he come and play with me again
    Mommy why did daddy say goodbye

That night she wrote a letter to one whose name she bore
She asked him to forget the past and come back once more
You little girl is pleading and calling Daddy's name
Oh, Won't you please come back again so she won't have to sayI'm alone tonight my darling
With another you have gone
Yet you tell me that you love me
That you'll always be my own

Yet no promise do you give me
When I beg you to be true
You just leave me sadly weepin'
Broken hearted over you

    Tell me now or tell me never
    You must answer me somehow
    For I've grown so tired of waiting
    Waiting for your solemn vow

I have always loved you darling
And I tried to make you care
But you've run around with others
Leaving my life cold and bare

With no promise for the future
You have left me here to cry
You must tell me little darling
Let your conscience be your guideThese heartaches now are on my way
What makes you want to be that way
You cheated on me and you lied
You put teardrops in my eyes

    I found out what they say is true
    I hope someday that you'll be blue
    And then you'll know dear why I cry
    With these teardrops in my eyes

I heard the rumors over town
That some day you'd let me down
I turn my head when gossip flies
Cause it puts teardrops in my eyes

 

I never thought you'd let me down
But now at last understand
You broke our promise and vows
You'll have to pay for it somehowYou who are on the road
Must have a code that you can live by
And so becomes yourself
Because the past is just a goodbye

Teach your children well
Their fathers health did slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they fixed the one you know by

    Don't you ever ask them why
    If they told you, would cry
    So just look at them and sigh
    And know they love you

And you of tender years
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by
And so please help them with yours
They seek the truth before they can die

Teach your parents well
Their children's health will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they fixed the one you know byCall up old Towser, call up old Joe
Make preparations, a hunting we must go
Tally ho, tally ho

Now mount up your horses, the dogs seem to know
Waiting for our signal they're rairing to go
Tally ho, tally ho

Now the fox hounds are running, watch Old Leed go
Heist up your horn and give her a blow
Tally ho, tally ho

Now the fox hounds are panting they all run too slow
The fox has out run them and they're heading for home
Tally ho, tally hoTake your dhoes off Moses you're on holy ground
    Holy ground, holy ground
    Take your shoes off Moses you're on Holy ground
    I am the Load, thy God

Well, God spoke to Moses in the burning bush
Burning bush, burning bush
Well, God spoke to Moses in the burning bush
Said I am the Lord, thy God

 

Well, rise up Moses and slice that rock
Slice that rock, well, slice the rock
Well, rise up Moses and slice that rock
Said I am the Lord, thy God

 

Well, rise up Moses and salvation work
Salvation work, salvation work
Well, rise up Moses and salvation work
Said I am the Lord, thy GodTake this hammer, carry it to the captain
    Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
    Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
    Tell him I'm a-gone, tell him I'm a gone

If he asks you, was I renning
If he asks you, was I renning
If he asks you, was I renning
Tell him I was flying

 

If he asks you, was I laughing
If he asks you, was I laughing
If he asks you, was I laughing
Tell him I was crying

 

I don't want no cornbread and 'lasses
I don't want no cornbread and 'lasses
I don't want no cornbread and 'lasses
It hurts my prideNow people their to watch my footsteps as I go by
They shake their heads and say I'm ridding high
But this thing, has done drove me wild
And now it's got me down
And made me the talk of the town

    I'll go down to the river and slowly walk around
    And if my thoughts don't change a lot
    I'll jump right in and drown
    For after what you've done to me
    I know I've grown to be
    The laughing stock the talk of the town

I used to think this couldn't happen to a guy like me
As night fall found me heading to your door
Now you don't seem to want me
Since a new love you have found
And now I am the talk of the townI'm happy now at last you are smiling
And I'm glad I have found you in his arms
For no longer I'll keep you unhappy
And I'll vow to never do you any harm

    Take my ring from your finger
    Set me free as a dove
    You don't need me no longer
    You have found the one you love

So my heart will likely break when I leave you
When my position at last I can see
When I found you in his arms you were crying
And that's more than you ever did for me

 

You can have our little home in the mountains
With the honeysuckles  twining round the door
When he carries you over the threshold
I hope that you'll be happy evermoreCome brothers, sisters, don't fall asleep
Pray night and day, or you'll sink in the deep
Fathers and mothers are crying so loud
Saying, Lord, won't you take us in your lifeboat

    Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
    It will stand the raging storm
    Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
    It will bear my spirit home

The clouds are so heavy, the winds are so loud
The thunder is falling, bursting in the clouds
They pray to their shipmates for what they have done
They took the dying sinners in the lifeboatAll alone at end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking bout a woman
Who might love 
I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I'm seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
So put me on a highway
And show me a sight
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money 
You can spend all your love making time 
If all's gone to pieces tommorrow
Would you still be mine
And whe you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find it the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back
You're running back
You're coming back for more
So put me on a highway
And show me a sight
And take it to the limit one more time
Tke it to the limit, take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more timeSwing low (swing low), sweet chariot
    Comin' for to carry me home
    Swing low (swing low), sweet chariot
    Comin' for to carry me home

I looked over jordan and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
A band of angels comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home

 

If you get to heaven before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm comin' too
Comin' for to carry me homeWhy don't you swing down chariots
    Stop and let me ride
    Swing sown chariots
    Stop and let me ride
    Rock me Lord, Rock me Lord
    Slow and easy
    I've got a home on the other side

Well I locked over Jordan
And what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels comin after me
Coming for to carry me home

 

Well if you got there before I do
Coming fot to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm coming to
Coming fot to carry me home

 

I'm sometimes up
And sometimes down
Coming for to carry me home
But still my soul is heaven bound
Coming fot to carry me homeYou told me that your love was true
Sweetheart, I thought the world of you
But now you left me all alone
I have no one to call my own

    Now sweetheart, you've done me wrong
    You have left me all alone
    Maybe there will come a time
    Sweetheart, when you will cange your mind

I never sheaa forget the day
When you said you were going away
I couldn't believe that it was true
After all the love I had for you

 

This road is rough and rocky too
As I travel on, dear, without you
But I'm still prayin' for the time
Sweetheart. when you will change your mindOne day a mother came to the prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done

    She did not bring to him a parol or pardon
    She brought no silver no pomp or style
    It was a halo bright sent down from heaven
    The sweetest gift a mother's smile

Her boy had drifted far from the fireside
Tho she had pleaded with him each night
Yet not a word did she ever utter
And tho her heart ached her smile was bright

 

She left a smile son you can remember
She's gone to heaven from heartache free
The bars around you could never change her
You were her baby and ere will beJust as far as I can remember
She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mom took sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts
The reason we've not called a family reunion
We knew you wouldn't be there
But since we thought in all over mom
We know your spirit is there

    Oh, we can't forget the hour
    You're the only one mom
    And sweeter that the flowers
    Oh no, there's no use to brother
    To speak of you now would only hurt fahter

It looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh mom, as I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead
They all gathered round, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mightly low
But htat was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so bad, you know

 

    Oh no, mom I'll never forget you
    And someday I'll meet you up thereSweet thing, I'm writing this letter to you
Your name will be blotted with tears
Please read it and answer, and tell me it's true
Your love will remain through the years

    Sweet thing, love you, you know that it's true
    Don't you remember that day
    As we grow older, I know you'll forget
    That's why I'm writing this way

I want to be loved but only by you
That's why tonight I'm so sad
I know that another has gained that reward
A love that I wanted so badTake me back to the place while I first saw the light
To the sweet sunny south, take me home
Where the mocking birds sang me to sleep in the night
Oh why was I tempted to roam

Oh, I think with regret of the dear friends I left
Of the dear hearts that sheltered me there
Of my wife and my family of whom I'm bereft
For the old place again do I sigh

The path to our cottage they say has grown green
And the cabin quite mossy around
And I know that the faces and the forms I have loved
Now lie in the cold mossy ground

But still I'll return to the place of my birth
For the children have played around the door
So I know that no matter how long I may live
They will echo our footsteps no more

Take me back to the place where the orange trees grow
To me plot in the evergreen shade
Where the floweres from river's green margin did grow
And spread their sweet scent thru the glade

Take me back to the place where my little ones sleep
Poor Massa lies buried close by
O'er the graves of my loved ones I long for to weep
And among them to rest when I dieStanding alone at a old country crossroad
Wondering which way will lead me to home
Ever so weary from chasing a dream
Thinking of Mary, Sweet Mary, and the miles in between

    Crossroads around me tell me you found me
    Found me, lead me, to the end of my dreams
    Three roads will lead me from the one that may need me
    But the other to Mary, Sweet Mary, and the miles in between

One lonly night I left out fo anger
Drifting and wasting my life's precious hours
But only last night I dreamed that a stranger
Was gathering for Mary, Sweet Mary, some beautiful flowersWho makes me forget all the other girls I've met
Sweet little miss blue eyes
Who's sweeter to me that she really ought to be
Sweet little miss blue eyes

    Little miss blue eyes looks so good
    I'm gonna bring her to the nighborhood
    I'm gonna make every girl in town
    Jealous when she's around

I'm walking the line 'cause I'm glad that she's mine
I'm living in paradies
I know I can't go wrong by just stringing along
With sweet little miss blue eyes

 

Who's gonna start taking care of my heart
She makes me realize
It's love, she's for me, and I really want to be
With sweet little miss blue eyesDarling, soon I will be sleeping in the churchyard over there
Where grass and flowers are growing and birds sing everywhere
Where the grass grows above me and spring flowers gentry wave
Will you do this, darling, plant sweet flowers on my grave

From you, sweetheart, I'm leaving your smile I'll never more see
Darling, don't grieve when we're parted, pretty flowers will speak to me
I will dream that you will be near me, as the blossoms gently wave
Will you do this, darling, plant sweet flowers on my grave

When the golden bond is broken, and they lay me down to sleep
This will be the only token of our love I will want to keep
That when I leave you, darling, this one little wish I crave
In memory of our love, dear, plant sweet flowers on my graveSpringtime is coming sweet lonesome bird
Your echo in the woodland I hear
Down in the meadow so lonesome your singing
While the moonlight is shining so clear
But I know he's away in a far distant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to me

    Sweet fern, sweet fern
    Oh tell me, is my darlign still true
    Sweet fern, sweet fern
    I'll be just as happy as you

Oh tell me sweet fern, is he thingking of me
And the promise he made long ago
He said he'd return from over the sea
Oh why do the years go so slow
But I know he's away in a far destant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to me

 

Upon my finger he placed a small ring
On the day he was leaving his home
I promised I'd be his own little girl
And love him wherever he'd roam
But I know he's away in a far distant land
A land that is over the sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And tell him to come back to meDon't forget me little darling whil I'm growing old and gray
Just a little thought before I'm going far away
I'll be waiting on the hillside where the wild red roses grow
On the sunny side of the mountains where the ripping waters flow

Don't forget about those says we courted many years ago
Don't forget all those promises you gave me and so
I'll be waiting on the hillside for the day you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippong waters fall

Please tell me darling in your letter do you think of me
Please answer little darling tell me where you can be
It's been so long since I've seen you but your love still lingers on
Don't forget me little darling though our love affair goneIt's such a beautiful day
That the sky seems to say, good morning
Mister, dust off your shoes throw away all your blues
And start smiling

Take a good around
There's no clouds lookin' down
Upon your way
So if you decide to come back alive
It's a new day

    Sunday sunrise shinin'
    Through my window pane
    Chasin' away my cares
    With all the pourin' rain
    Sunday sunrise unfoldin' like a smile
    Makin' me feel just like
    A new born baby child

Well I'm feeling so good
I keep knockin' on wood I'm not dreamin'
I hear birds everywhere
There's a song in the air with a meanin'

Sayin' it's time to wake up
Got a whole new out look from your view
Come on out where it's warm
It won't do any harm if you want to

 

It's such a beautiful day
That the sky seems to say,good morning
Mister,dust off your shoes
Throw away all your blues
And start smilin'
It's such a beautiful day
That the sky seems to say,good morningSummertime is past and gone
And I'm on my way back home
To see the only one I ever loved
Now the room is shining bright
It lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved

Oh I know she waits for me
Back in ol' Tennessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright
It lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever lovedIf you want to get you eye knocked out
If you want to get your fill
If you want to get your head cut off
Just go to sugar hill

Jay bird on the mountain top
And a red bird on the ground
Black bird in the sugar tree
Shaking that sugar down

They said she got mighty sick
And what do you recking ailed her
Drunk three quarts of sugar top
And then ther stomach failed her

Then cents in my pocket book
And don't you hear it jingle
I'm going to court them pretty gals
As long as I stay single

Yonder comes my own true love
And how do you think I know
Tell her by her shoe fly dress
That comes from sugar store

Get your banjo off the wall
Grap your fiddle, Bill
Hitch the horses to the sleigh
We're going to sugar hillGonna get out my sickle
Gonna shine up my shoes
And meet my baby and tell the news
Bet my money on a sway back nag
Come home a winner with plenty of swag

One foot, two foot, slew foot drag
Swing your honey to the Sugar foot rag
Diggin and Jiggin with a zig and zag
While the dobro plays that Sugar foot rag

Got a big jug of cider
And a little jug of wine
One for my honey and the other ones mine
Sip on the cider and sip on the wine
All sip together and have a good time

One foot, two foot, slew foot drag
Swingyour honey to the Sugar foot fag
Diggin and jiggin with a zig and zag
While the madoline plays that Sugar foot ragSugar coated love,you gave it me on a plate
    I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
    I found I had a cinder all covered up in whaite
    That old sugar coated love is something I can't bite

You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and lot my kind of my friend
Baby I feel down on my knees pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love

 

You called me your sugar plum,your baby and your pet
Said I was you Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel and my little sugar dove
You sure had me tooled,baby,with a sugar coated loveI sold a farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our friends and all our kin back there in Tennessee
I bought those one way tickets that's what she was begging for
And they took us to the Streets of Baltimore

Her eyes they shown with laughter when she was those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night
A man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind like the Streets of Baltimore

I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a nieghborhood serene
When I cam home from working late with every muscle sore
She'd brag me thru the Streets of Baltimore

I'd give anything to take her back to what she use to be
But I guess she loved those city lights more than she loved me
So I'm headin' home on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the Streets of Baltimore

Oh yes, my baby walks the Streets of BaltimoreLate one night in a bar room
A gay happy crowd was there
I sat alone at my table
My head bowed low in despair
My past was a vision before me
Everythihg I'd done was so wrong
Drifting on the road to destruction
I was lost and alone

    Oh Lord ( Lord ) have mercy
    On a poor lost sinner like me
    I'm on the path to destruction
    And no one can save me but thee

Then through the front door walked a stranger
In the clothes of a plain simple man
And the crowd all stared and wondered
At the bible he held in his had
He walked right up to my table
And he placed his hand gently on me
My son turn away form your sinning
And the joys of salvation you'll see

 

Then he truned and walked from the tavern
And the crowd made not a sound
I walked out to the sidewalk
But the man could not be found
Now I thank God for his mercy
And the love he showed for me there
When the stranger came into the tavern
In answer to a lost sinners prayerThough a pilgrim on earth I may journey alone
Knowing not what the future may hold, may hold
I'd rather have Jesus and sing a sweet song
That to covet their silver and gold

    Stormy water around me and the tempest and fury may roll
    But I have my dear Saviour how he helps me nobody can know
    When it seems I'm forsaken and my earthly freinds misunderstand
    Stormy waters surround me but I'll hold to God's unchanging hand

Angry billows may toss me and cause me to fear
Stormy waters around me may roll
I will hold to the hand of my Saviour so dear
He's the Shepherd that's keeping my soul

 

Though I have disappointments so often I sigh
And my cabin is humble and bare, and bare
But someday I'll inhearit a mansion on high
Where the beauties of heaven I'll shareI scarcely hear the wild wind's cry or feel its sudden blast
A greater storm just swept my world apart
Today you're with someday new my hopes are gone at last
There's stormy horizons in my heart

    Rain sweept and tattered like the rose in the wind
    Stormy horizons without and within
    You were all that mattered but you wanted to be free
    Now stormy horizons wait for me

Of things as fraglle and as sweet as roses dreams are made
And dreams we had you held so carelessly
They fell like petals round my feet I saw my rainbow fade
Now stormy horizons wait for meStone walls and steel bars, a love on my mind
    I'm a three time loser, I'm long gone this time
    Jealousy has took my young life
    All for the love of another man's wife
    I've had it coming, I've known all the time
    No more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mind

Gray-haired warden, deep Frisco Bay
Guards all around me leading my way
I've had it coming, I'm at the end of the line
No more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mindNow I'm so broken hearted I don't know what to do
I passed you today on the street
And you treated me like a stranger that you never knew
It's the same every time we meet

    You built a stone wall and around your heart
    Though my arms ache to hold you as before
    You built a stone wall all around your heart
    You won't let me love you anymore

How have I hurt you darling why won't you say
What have I done to you
For I still worship you dear in the same old way
How could you forget the love we knewMemories of yesterday are stepping stones
That pave the way to heartaches
Of a love I can't forget
I found this out to be so true
For all my memories of you
Have marked my lonely pathway of regret

    Stepping stones, they're only stepping stones
    I wish I'd never helped to pave the way
    Stepping stones, your lies were stepping stones
    That's why my heart is broke today

Moments sad and moments sweet
Are only stepping stones that meet
At the end of the pathway of heartbreak
Misery and bitter tears in this night
That's filled with fears
Are stepping stones that show me my mistakesI crossed the river, I felt fast asleep
Crossed the river, I felt fast asleep
Crossed the river, I felt fast asleep
When I woke, I had shackles on my feet

    I thought I heard that steamboat whistle blow
    I thought I heard that steamboat whistle blow
    I thought I heard that steamboat whistle blow
    Blow like she's never blowed before

I said Judge what might be my fine ?
I said Judge what might be my fine ?
I said Judge what might be my fine ?
Sixty days away on down the line

 * Refarin

Sixty days in a lonesome jail to go
Sixty days in a lonesome jail to go
Sixty days in a lonesome jail to go
I can't hear that steamboat whistle blowYou ought to see my blue eyes Sally
She live's down in shin bone slley
Number on the gate, number on the door
Next house over is a grocery store

    Sally all night, stay a little longer
    Dance all night, dance a little longer
    Pull off your coat and throw it in the corner
    Don't see why you son't stay a little longer

Can't ger home if you're going by the mill
Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
Big creek's up and the big creek's level
Plow my corn with a double shovel

 

Settin' in the window, singin' to my love
Slop bucket fell from window up above
Mule and grasshopper eatin' ice cream
Mule got sick and we laid him on a beamDarling, will you marry me I asked a maiden fair
I truned my back upon her when I looked she wasn't there

    She left me standing ( standing ) on the mountain
    She left me standing way up there

Where the honeybee are buzzing round the flowers there
That is where she vanished, somewhere in that mountain air

 

I just heard the whippoorwill a-taking to the bear
They were both a-laughing about her giving me the air

 

I would give most anything if once more she'd appear
And tell me that she cared a little fot this mountaineerSpring time in dear old Dixie
Is the time I love the best
I've roamed the whole world over
And it's my pick from all the rest
Where the apple bossoms blooming
And the air so fresh and clean
It's the prize of all the nation
The prettest place I've ever seen

    Where the burds sing so sweetly
    Wake you up in the early dawn
    And the dogwood blossoms blowing
    Make you glad that you were born
    And you're met with hearty welcome
    Makes you feel so good and then
    The flowers now bloom in dear old Dixie
    And it's spring time once again

In the woods you might go strolling
Picking flowers along the way
Then again you could go fishing
Take your lunch and spend the day
It's a dream the world may envy
And I hope it never ends
The folwers now bloom in dear old Dixie
And it's apring time once againThere's a ramshackle shack down in old Caroline
That's calling me back to that gal of mine
Those two brown eyes I long to see
The girl of my dreams she will always be

    Those two brown eyes that sparkle with love
    Sent down to me from heaven above
    If I had the wings of a beautiful dove
    I'd fly to the arms of the one that I love

When it's harvest time down in old Caroline
I'll ber drifting back to that gal of mine
I'll spend my days with the girl that I love
By the help of one up in heaven above

 

When the whippoorwills called on the hills far away
We'd sing love songs, and she would say
My love for you will never die
We bid farewell, and I said goodbyeMy Sophronie's from Kentucky, she's found another man
Can't even kiss her, can't even hold her hand
Oh when we used to love beneath the stars up in the sky
But now I'm just a hotshot with a teardrop in my eye

    Love em and leave em, kiss em and grieve em
    That used to be my motto so high
    Till my Sophronie left me so lonely
    Now there's teardrops in my eyes

Till Gabriel blows his bugle, I'll be lovin that sweet girl
She means more to me than the whole wide world
I used to be a killer with the women me oh, my
But now I'm just a hot shot with a teadrop in my eye

 

I used to slay the pretty girls from Maine to Alabam
Until I met Sophronie and then she let me down
I seen so many pretty eyes and filled with bitter tears
Find em, forget em, but now I have my fearsI'm the son of a sawmill man
    Son of a sawmill man
    I've cut big timber all over this land
    I'm the son of a sawmill man

My papa was a sawmill man I've heard some people say
He was just as tall as the timber he worked until his dying day
He was hard as the oak but his heart was as soft as the pines in Georgia land
And I'm just a chip from the same old block I'm the son of a sawmill man

 

I was born among the mnighty redwood trees where you'd think they reach the sky
Papa worked hard ans his pay was samll but we always did get by
The first thing I remember I had a saw in my right hand
So I'm just a chip from the same old block I'm the son of a wawmill manSomewhere tonight, a heart is breaking
And wishing death would ease the pain
Somewhere tonight, someone is longing
To kiss, your sweet lips once again

No one, will ever love you darling
Although they tell you that they do
I give, my heart and soul to you dear
Forever, they belong to you

The stillness of the night that lingers
Without you darling don't seem right
But if you're happy with another
Remember me somewhere tonightI'm just someone you have forgotten
And left me with these blues on my mind

I hear that lonesome whippoorwill calling
On a hill so far away
His heart's like mine now it's breaking
For someone that's gone away

    I'm just someone you have forgotten
    But in dreams I still call you mine
    You broke a trusting heart that loves you
    And left me with these blues on my mind

I remember the night that you told me
That forever you'd be mine
All the time you loved another
Loving me was just too blindIn a noisy eastern city sat a lonely lad one night           
In a bar room where the wine began to flow From a table in the corner the young man slowly              
And he said it's getting late boys I must go                 
       
    For somebody's waiting for me         
    Someone who loves me I know           
    There's a light shining bright in the window  For somebody's waiting for me         
             
I suppose you have a sweetheart his companions jovially said 
If she's pretty we would like to see her too                 
If you'll only stop your teasing I will show her to you boys 
She's the only sweetheart that I ever knew 

                 
        
                 

                 
From an old brown leather pocketbook a picture he did take   
Of a gray-haired lady with a bowed-down head                 
She's my mother and my sweetheart and she waits for me tonight   So you see I told the truth boys when I saidI see the postman coming
He's coming down the street
He's going to bring a letter
He's headed straight for me

    Somebody loves you darling
    Somebady loves you, I know
    Somebody loves you darling
    Why did you let them go

There's going to be a wedding
It's going to be next fall
So boys gather round and be ready
I'm going to invite you allI've been working out in the rain 
Try to the dirty old ball and chain
Oh dear mother, I'll come home some old day
Some sweet day they'll turn me loose
From this dirty old calaboose
Oh dear mother, I'll come home some old day

    Some old day you'll wait for me and pray
    Oh dear mother, I'll come home some old day
    Some sweet day they'll turn me loose
    From this dirty old calaboose
    Oh dear mother, I'll come home some old day

Oh dear mother, I've hurt you so
And I've been cruel to you I know
Oh dear mother, I'll come home some old day
Tell my brother, my sister and dad
They're the best friends that I've had
Oh dear mother, I'll come home some old daySome how tonight feel lonely my darling
    Some how tonight feel blue
    Some how tonight there tears of mine keep falling
    Come back aweetheart and be true

I thought you love was something I could treasure
To brighten my pathway through the years
All can see is darkness in the future
That why I long to have you near

 

I never knew what loneliness meant darling
Until watched you walk away
I long to hear you whisper that you love me
I can't forget our happy daysWhere is the love that you promised neath the pine
Gone like the flowers in the fall
You crossed your heart now you're double crossing mine
You've been petending after all

    I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
    Drifting in sorrow down the stream
    Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
    When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

I never dreamed that your love would grow so cold
Hiding behind the rainbow's end
You must be blind for the glitter of the gold
Gold that can never find a friend

 

You'll never know what it means to sit and cry
After your heart is broken too
Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die
When some one double crosses youAll around the cabin door falls little flackes of snow
I'm searching for the foot prints of the one that I loved so
The last time I saw my darling the earth was covered white
And little flakes of snow have faded my sweetheart's path tonight

    From this cabin she did go, I watched her foot prints fade
    I don't know why she left me, I never dreamed she'd go away
    Little snow flakes fell from Heaven from the Heaven way up above
    And paved a way made a snow white grave of the only one I loved

She left memory of tender love and a picture on the wall
My teardrops now are bigger than the snow white flakes that fall
And each moment I grow weaker sadly gazing at the snow
And I feel that I will fade away with that slow melting snowWell I've been loving only you for so long
And I've never once regretted a single day
And it took a lot of woman
To stay right a lot of woman
To stay right here so long
Through all those long old lonely nights
And all my old fashion ways

    Sleepy eyes, sleeping in the falling rain
    lonely skies, crying on the window pane
    Oh you're mine only, always mine only
    Sleepy eyes sleeping in the falling rain

When I go out and travel
Round this country side
I'll make 'em forget their problems
For awhile and it dosen't take too much
To ease this heart of mine
Just a good ole' country melody
And your sweet summer smileLost my partner what'll I do
Lost my partner what'll I do
Lost my partner what'll I do
Skip to my Lou my darling

    Gone again, skip to my Lou
    Gone again, skip to my Lou
    Gone again, skip to my Lou

Skip to my Lou mu darlingWhen we were young we played together
That's the way our love began
Now you're gone you've found another
And we're no more than just friends

    Sixteen years we were married
    I remeber the day that we were wed
    Sixteen years is a mighty long time
    Now you're gone I'm losing my mind

Days are long honey nights are lonesome
Seems like years are passed and gone
I didn't know that you were unhappy
I didn't know anything was wrongSix more miles to the grave yard
Six more miles left to ride
Six more miles and leave my darling
Leave the best friend I ever had

Oh, I see the rain a falling
And my heart is so sore
Six more miles and leave my darling
Never on this earth to see no more

And I hear the train a blowing
Calling my darling back home
Six more miles and leave my darling
Never on this earth no more to roam

Leave her in that lonely church yard
Leave my darling all alone
Now I'm sad, my heart is crying
As I wander thru life aloneI t waws in the spring one sunny day
My good girl left me, lord, she went away
 
    And now she's gone and I don't worry
    'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

She called me up from down in El paso
Said come back, daddy, lord I need you so
 
 

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Show me a woman a man can trust

 

Mississippi River, long, deep and wide
The woman I'm loving is on the other side

 

You don't like my oeaches, don't you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be

 

Don't you come here running, porking out your hand
I'll get me a woman like you got your manOh, the little country church where we used to sing and pray
    How God would bless us in the old fashioned way
    It's still in my memory, oh, I can see it now
    We would sing all day, have dinner on the ground

If the whole would loved Jesus you'd find more people there
Singing, rejoicing as they kneel in prayer
Then an old fashioned handshake and gather around
At the Singing all day and dinner on the ground

 

We would sing those old songs and the preacher would preach
Of how Jesus died for you and for me
You could feel the Great Spirit from Heaven pouring down
At the singing all day and dinner on the groundIn this world of sorrow I've seen troubles and woe
Way up there in glory, Lordy, I'll see no more
For I know my prayers have not been in vain
When I get to glory I'm gonna sing, sing, sing

    When I get to glory I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
    I'm gonna let the hallelujahs ring
    I'm gonna praise my blessed Saviour's name
    When I get to glory I'm gonna sing, sing, sing

Sometimes I get so weary inside
That I recall how my Jesus died
Up there I know there'll be no more pain
When I get to glory I'm gonna sing, sing, sing

 

Up there, no tears will blind my eyes
As I walk along by my Jesus's side
I'll meet my loved ones all once again
When I get to glory I'm gonna sing, sing, singEvery minute seems like an hour
Every hour seems like a day
Maybe you don't realize, my darling
But you broke my heart the day you went away

Here's thing or two to ask the other
Will he love you when your old and gray
Will he hold your hand when old and wrinkled
Like I did the day you went away

Now there will come a time when you'll be sorry
Sorry for the things you do and say
I am not the blame if you must suffer
Like I did the day you went awaySince I've used my bible for a road map
I've been traveling toward the promised land
There has been no worry or obstruction
No rough pavement and no sinking sand

    I'm on the right road to glory
    Jesus leads me by the hand
    Since I've used my bible for a road map
    All my earthly travels have been grand

Since I've used my bible for a road map
I'm insured by Jesus day and night
And if I take the wrong direction
My bible will always steer me rightThis old towns filled with sin, it'll swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away, you've got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn

    This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
    It seems like this whole town's insane
    On the 31st floor a gold plated door
    Won't keep out the lord's burnin' rain

A friend came around, tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
He trusted his crowd, so he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they hadSilver wing on the water
    Carry me away where I belong
    And I'll live my life, morning, noon and night
    So keep rolling Red River roll along

Lying on the bank
Early in the morning
Sandies flopping in the sun
Thinking about the day
When I'll be going
Down there to catch me some
When all my work is done

  

I'll be sitting on the porch
Every evening
Slapping mosquitoes flying by
And it won't be too long
Till I'll be seeing
Those black jacks growing high
And I'm just gonna rideI don't want your lonely mansion with
The chill in every room
I just want the love you promised
Beneath the pale moon
But you think I should be happy with
Your money and your name
And Pretend that I don't notice while
You play your cheatin' game

    Silver threads and golden needles can't
    Put up this heart of mine
    And I'll never drown my sorrows in the
    Warm glow of your wine
    You can't buy my love with money
    For I never was that kind
    Silver threads and golden needles can't
    Patch up this heart of mine

I grew up in faded gingham where love
Is a sacred thing
You grew up in silk and satin
Where love's a passin game
I know now you never loved me
And I know now I was a fool to think your
Pride would let you
Live by the golden ruleIn a vine-covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered life's sorrows
Is that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to dear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but frant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine

I know it's too late, dear old daddy
To repay for the sorrows and cares
Tho dear mother is waiting in Heaven
Just to comfort and solace you thereJust heart beat ago my darlingh left me
With a good by kiss she sadly broke the news
In her empty chair that's just across the table
Sets my brand new silent partner called the blues

Her cigarette's still burning in the ash tray
Reminds me of the pain I put her thru
As I watch the front door slowly close behind her
Though the back door walked my partner called the blues

As I look back at the time we spent together
I can see how wrong I've been for all these years
For she offered me a lifetime of devotion
In return she'll walk a highway paved with tears

I know its too late to ask forgiveness
With a love like hers its just too much to lose
Now I know that I must start my life all over
With my brand new silent partner called the bluesShort life of trouble
    A few more words to part
    Short life of trouble, dear girl
    For a boy with a broken heart

Remember what you promised
Not more than a week ago
You promised that you'd marry me
Standing in your mama's door

  

Now you've gone and left me
I don't know what I'll do
I'd give this world and half of my life
Just to be married to you

  

Now you've broken your promise
Go marry whom you may
In this old world so big and so wide
I'll ramble back some day

  

My right foot's on the platform
My left foot's on the train
I'm leaving you and this lonesome old town
To never return againDeep in the morrow of sin I was sinking
There was no one to guide my way
All my life I was in the shadow till I heard the Savior say
If you give heed to the blessed promise and become a child of mine
When you enter the gates of heaven, you will, shine, shine, shine

    Oh, I'm gonna shine like a star in the morning
    Many mansions will be mine
    When I enter the gates of heaven
    I'm gonna shine, Hallelujah, I'm gonna shine

Jesus (o'the) Lord is now my refuge
Daily He leads me by the hand
He will be my saty and comfort till I reach the glory land
So I press along with the hopes eternal springing in this heart of mine
When I enter the gates of heaven, I will shine, shine, shine

  

We were shine, burdened with many affections
Ofter unsightly things we hear
But we'll all be like our Savior when we reach that home up there
Daily I'll walk in His dear footsteps growing more like Him all the time
When I enter the gates of heaven, I will shine, shine, shineIn the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia
Lives a girl who is waiting just for me
How many nights we have waltzed in the moonlight
And in her lovely arms I long to be

I miss her smile in the moonlight
And I know she misses me too
In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia
I know that her love to me is trueHow many songs heve been sung about rivers
Mississippi, Potomac, and Ohio too
Still in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley
The Shenandoah river runs peacefully through

    Deep in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley
    The Shenandoah river flows quiet and serene
    On to the James, then at Norfolk, Varginia
    She floats all her secrets out into the sea

How many heartaches and troubles and sorrow
How many pleasures this river has seen
How many smiles and sadness have lingered
Memories that no one would ever believe

  

Horses and buggies, that gasoline engines
Have all rode the crest of her beautiful waves
She's seen loves smile, heard their vows in the moonlight
Free to the thirsty her water she gaveShes gone, gone, gone, gone,gone, gone
    Crying won't bring her back
    The more that I cry the faster that train
    Flys father on down the track

She said if ever deceived her
She'd be gone before I could count ten
I guess that I didn't believe her
Now look at the trouble I'm in

  * refrain

I've lost ever right to be happy
When I lost the heaven I found
She said she'd be gone and she left me
Before my first tear hit the ground

  

If only knew where find her
I'd crawl there on my hands and knees
Each tick of the clock there reminds her
She's one second farther from me

  

Father on down the track
Father on down the trackShe's my curly headed baby
Used to sit on Mommas knee
She's my curly headed baby
She's from sunny Tennessee

I have loved her since I met her
More than an tongue can tell
If she ever proves false hearted
I can never say farewell

I am funny about the women
For I'll tell you what they'll do
They'll be crying over your shoulder
And flirtin with another too

She's my curly headed baby
I don't care what people say
If she leaves me for another
That well be her burying day

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't never shine
Than of her to be some others darlin
When she promised ot be mineShe's there at the bar every evening
Face powdered and cheeks painted red
Her beauty has faded too early
Brought on by the fast life she led

    She's more to be pitied than scolded
    She needs to be loved, not despised
    Too much beer and wine, too many good times
    The lure of the honky tonk wrecked her young life

She once was the belle of the ballroom
She'd made some man a sweet wife
But too many parties, the wrong kind of pals
Ruined her happy young lifeShe's just a cute thing
With eyes that speakels with love
Thinking of her beauties
Oh how I wish I could hug

    She's not the kind you picture
    In any walk of life
    And I can see her only
    As my beloved wife

I courted her in high school and there I won her love
I swore her in high school and there I won her love
And then I joined the service I lived to serve my time
And then a guy met her with eyes that seemed like mine

  

I scorned for this action
And now might say that we're through
But trying to forger her
Is more than I can doBack to my home town I wanderd one day
It seemse that the old sang had drifted away
I wandered down Main Street, the view to enjoy
There I met with a girl I had loved as a boy

    Gone are the days when our hearts beat as one
    All I can say now is see what you done
    Gone are the days when we thrilled to each vow
    She has forgotten everything now

I still have her picture her face sweet and fair
A rose that she gave me, a lock of her hair
I'll treasure and keep them, it's silly I know
For she has forgotten, long long agoAs I was out walking down by the seashore
I met a fair maiden, she sure did look grand
Her lace and her diamonds and her hair shone like gold
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old

Her fingers they jingled like bells on a door
Her nose was turned up but not very much more
When we were married, the wedding bells told
I have married a young lady just nineteen years old

When we were married and retired for our rest 
My love changed for her, why you can guess
For a box full of powders my love did unfold
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old

She raked from her pale cheeks a box full of paint
When she took out her false teeth, I thought I would faint
Out upon the carpet her glass eye did roll
She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old

She unsnapped her fingers, I counted just three
Then she unscrewed both cork legs up to her knees
When she took off her false wig, her old bald head told
I had married an lod lady about ninety years oldCheeks as red as the blooming rose
Eyes of the deepest brown
You are the darling of my heart
Stay till she sun goes down

Shady Grove, my little love
Shady Grove, my dear
Shady Grove, my little love
I'm going to leave you here

Shady Grove my little love
Standin' in the door
Shose and stockin's in her hand
And her little bare feet on the floor

Wish I had a big, fine horse
Corn to feed fim on
Pretty little girl stay at home
Feed him when I'm gone

Shady Grove, my little love
Shady Grove, I say
Shady Grove, my little love
Don't wait till Judgment DayOh a long lonesome journey I'm going
Oh darling now please don't you cry
For in shackles and chains they will take me
To a prison to stay till I die

    And a night through the bars I will gaze at hte stars
    And think of our love lost in vain
    A piece of stone I will use for my pillow
    While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains

Put your arms through the bars once my little darling
Let me kiss those sweet lips I love best
For in heartaches you're my consellation
And in sorrow my keeper of restJust seven years ago today
Was when you said good-bye
It broke my heart to see you go
And yet I could not cry

You kissed me sweet and said good-bye
But I could not believe
That you would ever make me cry
Unwanted and to grieve

    The sun is slowly sinking down
    To make the close of day
    To make the end of seven years
    The ending of my way

I had no one to stand by me
To count these bitter tears
I could never live these awful blues
Another seven years

I had waited seven years today
To see your face once more
And if my life could be as long
I'd wait ten thousand moreSeven cent cotton and forty cent meat
How in the world can a poor man eat
Flour up high and cotton down low
How in the world can we raise any dough
Clothes worn out, shoes urn down
Old slouch hat with a hole in the crown
Back nearly broken and fingers all sore
Cotton gone down to rise no more

Seven cent cotton and forty cent meat
How in the world can a poor man eat
Mules in the barn, no crops laid by
Corn crib empty and the cow's gone dry
Well water low, nearly out of sight
Can't take a bath on Saturdy night
No use talking, any man is beat
With seven cent cotton and forty cent meat

Seven cent cotton and eight dollar pants
Who in the world has got a chance
We can't buy clothes and we can't buy meat
Too much cotton and not enough to eat
Can't help each other, what shall wo do
I can't explain it so it's up to you
Seven cent cotton and two dollar hose
Guess we'll have to do without any clothes

Seven cent cotton and forty cent meat
How in the world can a poor man eat
Poor getting poorer all around here
Kids coming regular every year
Fatter our hogs, take 'em to town
All we get is six cents a pound 
Vety next day we have to buy it back
Forty cents a pound in a paper sackDown by the waterfall
    Where the waters run so cool
    There no secrets ever fall
    From the lips of the fool

Jeniffer was seventeen the same age as I
She had lived next door to us since we were five
She knew I loved her dearly, I told her many times
And I looked forward to the day that she would be all mine

One more year of school we thought, then wedding bells would ring
But the hand of fate has ways of changing everything
I walked upon the two of them down by the waterfall
Jeniffer and Jimmy Jones they saw me not at all

  

Jimmy Jones was married and had a family
And I just couldn't understand why they did this to me
Both were scared that all they thought I'd do was tell his wife
Their faces turned to master fear before I took their life

People thought that Jeniffer just up and ran away
Jimmy Jones who disappeared is a mystery to day
Many years has passed but bitterly I still recall
And only I alone know what's behind the waterfallThe seasons come the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow
Just a way that it was planned to be
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
Cause flowers will bloom eternally

    You leaving will bring autumn sorrow
    And my tears like withered leaves will fall
    But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
    And darling we could be happy after all

As it is nature's plan no season gets the upper hand
Oh how I tried to keep this fact in mind
The trees are bare the cold wind blow
And by experience we'll know
that winter comes but spring is close behindI'm ready now to settle down
All I've got the days I've roamed
Darling, darling whom I love
Say you'll take me back once more

    Another love has wrecked my life
    She stole my love for you away
    And now I beg you to forget
    And take me in your arms to stay

Your loving heart has truned to stone
I know your love for me is cold
But now I need you oh so much
To love with all my heart and soulGot anything good you better save it, save it
    Got anything good you better save it, save it
    Got anything good you better save it, save it
    Baby I might need it some day

They say your cooking is the best in town
Everybody's been talking around
If it's so I'm a'coming to town
I'll let you turn my damper down

  

You roll your stockings to your knees
Strut around dear as you please
Cuddie up like a turtle dove
If you don't stop you'll flub your dub

  

There'll come a day when you're old and gray
When all your friends have strayed away
Then I'll look at you and say
You had it but it got away

  

Now stop your honky tonking around
Stop your painting up the town
Change your way from what you did
If you don't stop I'll blow my lidHow many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
Once rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was winning in fortune and fame
Everything I could wish for to get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money won't buy back your youth when you're old
A friend when yuou're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When my life is over, my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones will weep, there's no doubt
But one things for certain, when it comes muy time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mindStandin' on the corner with the low-down blues
A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey, let me be your salty dog

    Let me be your salty dog
    Or I won't be your man at all
    Hony, let me be your salty dog

Now look-a hear, Sal, I know you
A run-down stockin' and a worn-out shoes
Honey, let me be your salty dog

  

I was down in the wildwood settin' on a log
Finger on the trigger and an eye on the hog
Honey let me be your salty dog

  

I pulled the trigger and the gun said go
Shot fell over in Mexico
Honey let me be your salty dogSal got a meatskin hid away
Sal got a meatskin hid away
Sal got a meatskin hid away

Went to see my Sally Gray
Went to see my Sally Gray
Went to see my Sally Gray
Found out Sal is gone away

Reckon I love my Sally Gray
Reckon I love my Sally Gray
Reckon I love my Sally Gray
Reckon my Sal is gone awaySometimes I wish things were better
But most times I'd settle for different
Just to know that the day that's waiting for me
Ain't the same one that I just spent

    I think I'll sail to Australia
    Take these old days off of my hands
    Drink a beer by the Indian Ocean
    Make love right there on the sand

My only family is my father
And he can take care of himself
He don't need me like I need to know
The sight of someplace else

  * Refarin

They speak English in Australia
And it won't be hard to make new friends
To see myself as other people see me
Without knowing just where I've beenI'm a prisoner alone and forgotten
I'll be here until the day I die
All because when a boy I was foolish
All because I was fast with a knife

    I'm a man that's doomed to be lonely
    I'm a man that's doomed to be sad
    I've got no name, just a number
    And I've lost all the friends that I've had

If I had my life to live over
I'd travel the narrow and straight
But I'd still be at home with my loved ones
And not behind these iron gates

  

Young men when you have heard my story
Let it teach you the right from the wrong
And I know my life wasn't wasted
Writing this sad prosoner's songToday has been a lonesome day
    Today has been a lonesome day
    Today has been a lonesome day
    And tomorrow 's gonna be the same old way

Oh, they carried my mother to the burying ground
Oh, they carried my mother to the burying ground
Oh, they carried my mother to the burying ground
I watched as the bearers let her down

  

Did you ever hear a church bell tone
Did you ever hear a church bell tone
Did you ever hear a church bell tone
You may know by that she's dead and gone

  

Oh, digmy grave with a silver spade
Oh, digmy grave with a silver spade
Oh, digmy grave with a silver spade
And mark the place where I must lay

  

There's one kind favor I ask of you
There's one kind favor I ask of you
There's one kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept green

  * RefrrainRuby, Ruby
    Honey are you mad at your man

I will set you in the shade
Shovel with my spade
Digging in the Brown Coal Mine

  

I've done all I can do
To get along with you
Still you're not satisfied

  

If you don't believe I'm right
Then follow me tonight
I'll take you to my shanty so coldI am a roving gambler, gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down

I had not been in Frisco many more weeks than three
I met up with a pretty little girl, she fell in love with me
Fell in love with me, fell in love with me

She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with her fan
Whispered low in her mother's ear I love this gambling man
Love this gambling man, love this gambling man

Oh daughter, oh daughter, how can you treat me so
Leave your dear old mother and with the gambler go
With the gambler go, with the gambler go

Oh mother, oh mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see me coming back, I'll be with the gambling man
With the gambling man, with the gambling man

I left her in Frisco, I would up in Maine
I met up with a gambling man, we got in a poker game
Got in a poker game, got in a poker game

He put his money in the pot and dealt the cards around
Saw him deal from the bottom of the deck, so I shot the gambler down
Shot the gambler down, shot the gambler down

Now I'm down in prison, got a number for my name
The warden said as he locked the door you've gambled your last game
Gambled your last game, gambled your last gameWell, it's a long long way
It's a long long way
To the Gulf of Mexico

    Well, I make my home on the Mississippi
    I'm a roustabout on a Steamboat line
    Let's hit the deck on a Monday morning
    Let's make the lock on a Saturday night

Well, I have me a gal way down in Vicksburg
And she used to stop every time I passed
Then she made off with a little rich man
With a new silk suit and a little mustacheThere's a little rosewood casket
Laying on a marble stand
And a package of old letters
Written by my true love's hand
Go and get them for me sister
Read them o'er and o'er to me
I have often tried to read them
But for tears, I could not see

Come up closer to me sister
Let me lean upon your breast
For the tide of life is ebbing
And soon I'll be at reast
Read them over to me sister
While I gently fall asleep
Fall asleep to wake in Jesus
Dearest sister do not weep

Tell him sister if you see him
That I never ceased to love
That my dying prayer's to meet him
In a better world above
There's a little rosewood casket
Laying on a marble stand
And a package of love letters
Written by her true love's handRoses for the sun day morning
Falling soft upon the bed
Growing in a sleeping valley
Rising from the river's edge

Morning glows for her rainbow
Greeting her when she awake
Gathered from a mountain meadow
Restin' by a silver lade

    If all my night were never ending
    And all my days were forever
    I'd need more time to gather flowers
    That I would like to give her

Daisys for her morning table
Wishing her a pleasant day
Picked from fields upon the hillside
Warmed by wind from off the day

Lilacs fer her golden dreses
Whishin' that they could be worn
Fragrant blossoms on the branches
From the California shower
   
�@We knew no sorrow and we knew no grief
Until they loving face was missed
There are the engravings upon his tombstone
Each time that we read them we realize he's gone

Just like a rose he was picked from our view
He was  needed in heaven with God's chosen few
My mother was called just a few weeks before
Two angels have bloomed like a rose on God's shore

I guess Jesus thought him unsafe here below
So he called him home while he's ready to go
That beautiful smile on his face that I kissed
I've never known sorrow till that  face I missedRoll on, buddy, roll on
    Roll on, buddy, roll on
    Wouldn't roll so slow
    If you knew what I know
    So roll on, buddy, roll on

I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to that east pay road
I'm going to that east, I going to the west
I'm going to the one that I love best

  

My home in down in Tennessee
My home in down in Tennessee
In sunny Tennessee, that's where I want to be
Way down in sunny Tennessee

  

I've got a good woman just the same
I've got a good woman just the same
Got a woman just the same, and I'm gonna change her name
I've got a good woman just the sameRoll, muddy river, roll on, muddy river, roll on
    I've got a notion you'll go to the ocean alone
    Cause I've got a baby in Tennessee
    Who's long been awaiting for little old me
    So, roll, muddy river, roll on, muddy river, roll on

Three long months on a sand barge tour
How much more can a man endure
It's high time I was home for sure
So roll, muddy river, roll on

  

New orleans on to old St.Lou
Stopped by Memphis, Minneapolis, too
Back in Nashville I'll be through
So roll, muddy river, roll on

  

I love you but just call it fate
You and I are gonna separate
You'll be here but she won't wait
So, roll, muddy river, roll onRoll in my sweet baby's arms
    Roll in my sweet baby's arms
    Lay around the shack 'til the mail comes back
    And roll in my sweet baby's arms

I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train come back
And roll in my sweet baby's srms

  

Now where were you last Friday's night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the street another man
Would even go my bail

  

I know you parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any moreIt's rough old road I'm travelin' wading knee deep in the blue
Everytime I think I'm winning I find out I only lose
Well I've learned a lot of lessons that they never taught in school
Cause this rocky road I travel is a road that's walked by fools

On this road are wine and women, life is just a game of chance
You can't eat your cake and have it, you pay the piper when you dance
I've been cheatin on my baby, I've been breakin' all the rules
So I'm headin' now for heartaches on this road that's walked by fools

If you're on this lonesome highway and your heart is sorrow bound
Someday like me you'll find out there's no place to turn around
Better walk that straight and narrow and live by the Golden Rule
Or some day like me they'll find you on this road that's walked by foolsWish that I was on ol' Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear, other half cat
Wild as a mink, but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

    Rocky Top, you'll always be
    Home sweet home to me
    Good ol' Rocky Top
    Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Looking for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

  

I've had years of crimped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple againI've got those blues, I'm wearin' out the soles of my shoes
I've got those blues, I'M wearing out the soles of my shoes
My gal went away and left me
She left me with the dog gone blues

    Now the road is rocky, but it won't be rocky long
    Now the road is rocky, but it won't be rocky long
    Another man has got my woman and gone

You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your water till the well runs dry
You'll never miss your waman untill she says goodbye

  

I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home
I'm not so lonesome, just don't want to be aloneOn the banks of the river where the willows hang down
And the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
Down in the hollow where the waters run cold
It was there I first listened to the lies that you told

Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
The past I remember time cannot erase
The letter you wrote me it was written in shame
And I know that your conscience still echoe's my name

Now the nights are so long Lord sorrow runs deep
And nothing is worse htan a night without sleep
I'll walk out alone and look at the sky
To empty to sing to lonesome to cry

If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies wore thrushes
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrel's with high bushy talls
I'd fill up gun with rock salt and nailsI've got a wife and five little children
Believe I'll make a trip on the big Macmillan
O  Saro Jane

    O there's nothing to do but to set down and sing
    And rock about, my Saro Jane
    O rock about my Saro Jane
    O rocl about my Saro Jane
    O there's nothing to do but to set down and sing
    And rock about, my Saro Jane

Boiler busted and the whistle done blowed
The head captain done fell overboard
O Saro Jane

  

Engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall
The engineer gone ti the hole in the wall
O Saro Jane

  

Yankees built boats for to shoot them rebels
My musket's loaded and I'm goona hold her level
O Saro Jane(So won't you)
    Ride me down easy, lord, ride me on down
    Leave word in the dust where I lay
    Say I'm easy to come, easy to go
    I'm easy to love when I say

This old highway she's hotter than nine kind of hell
The rides, they're as scare as the rain
When you're down to your last shuck with nothing to sell
And too far away from the trains

It's been oh good month of sunday and a guitar ago
Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends
Some sheets in the wind and some satisfied women behind

  

Put snow on the mountain
Raised hell on the hill
Locked horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum,a son of the gun
And a hobo with stars in his crownSo often down here we'll have a reunion
Our loved ones and friends will be gathered around
Some faces are missed. they have gone home to heaven
They will be there with Jesus 'til the trumpet shall sound

    What a wonderful time we'll have up in Glory
    With our blessed Redeemer forever we'll see
    And a crown he will give on that great judgment morning
    What a happy reunion in Heaven will be

No crepes on the doors in that beautiful city
No sorrow or pain never more ever there
But a body we'll have, in the Saviour's own likeness
And a mansion Jesus said he'd go to prepare

  

I am longing to sit by the banks of the river
There's rest for the ones by the evergreen trees
I am longing to look in the face of my Saviour
And my loved ones who have gone, they are waiting for meReuben James, in my song you'll live again
In the phrases that I write
In the footsteps out of sight
For the time that I knew you, Reuben James

Ruben James, all the folks around
Midson County cursed your name
Just a no count share cropping colored man
Steal anything he can
Everybody layed the blame on Rueben James

    Rueben James, use to walk the furred fields of my mind
    Raded shirt and weathered brow
    Callosed hands upon the plow
    Loved yuo then and I loved you now, Ruben James

Reuben James, with your mind on the soul
And the Bible in your right hand
So trun the other cheek, there's a better
World waiting fot the meek
In my mind these words remain from Rueben James

  

Reuben James, one dark cloudy day they
Brought you from the field
Until your lonely pine box came
Just the preacher me and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain for Reuben JamesRemembering me dear when your love meant everything
When the memory of your kiss remains with me
I thought we'd be so happy dear there forgether through the years
Now I'm left here all alone, remember me

Remember me the day we met, and wondering
If you ever really loved and cared for me
In our future you and me left it all in memory
But I relived oe'r and oe'r remember me

If the world could only know the many things
That have made my aching heart look longingly
In the days spent happily when alone just you and me
Such a lovely past I see, rememver me

Remembering the words you said and didn't mean
I believed with all my heart you wanted me
I guess my thoughts were right of schemes fot you found someone new it seems
I hope some day I find you here, rememberingDo you think of the cross on which Jesus died
And the blood He shed for you
Are you prepared to meet Him in that land of love
By His word are you going to abide

    Remember the cross on which Jesus died
    Follow in His footsteps each day
    He shed His blood for you and He shed His blood for me
    Never cast that cross aside

Never let other people lead you astray
Teach His word to them if you can
They must think of the cross on which Jesus died
And get ready to meet Him some day

  

When side Jesus comes down from heaven above
And you haven't thought of the throne
He'll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
And you won't see His blessed home aboveThe sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days were the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said Sweetheart remember me

    Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
    Remember me at the close of a long long day
    It would be so sweet, when all alone I'm dreaming
    Just to know you still remember me

You told me onece that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'til the end of eternity
But al those vows are broken now and we will never 
Be the same except in memory

  

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
A sweeter smile, and a love more bold and free
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart dear
If they do, sweetheart, remember meI climbed the Redwood hill
Was on a rainy day
To  rise avobe the clouds
And talk with Mother Nature for awhile
She told me of her love
For the children in her trust
And of a great concern
From the likes of you and me and her

I'd didn't know she was
She did speak there tender words
The things that I am
I could not change for any man
I tried to comfort her
But she would not be still
And how the rain did fall
As I found my way back down the Redwood hillThere once lived an indian maid
A shy little prairie maid
Who sang a lay, a love song gay
As on the plain she'd while away the day
She loved a warrior bold
This shy little maid of old
But blythe and gay, he rode one day
To battle far away

    Now, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
    The breeze is sighing, the night bird's crying
    For afar neath his star her brave is sleeping
    While Red Wings weeping her heart away

She watched thru the day and night
She kept all the campfiles bright
And under the sky, each night she would lie
And dream about his coming by and by
But when all the braves returned
The heart of Red Wing yearned
For Brave one day, her warrior gay
Fell bravely in the frayI should have known you've bid me farewell
There's lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Always running never caring
That's the life you live
Stoken minutes of your time
Were all you had to give

    And I guess it's gonna be alright
    Yes the worst is over now
    The morning sun is shining
    Like a red rubber ball
    I guess it's gonna be alright
    Yes the worst is over now
    The morning sun is shining
    Like a red rubber ball

Now you never cared for the secrets I could find
To you I'm just an ornament
Something for your mind
This roller coaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spentI've got no use for a red rockin' chair
Got no Honey Baby now, Lawd, Lawd
Got not sugar baby now

Who'll rock the crable, who'll sing the song
Who'll rock the crable when I'm gone, Lawd, Lawd
Who'll rock the crable when I'm gone

Now ah'll rock the crable ah'll sing the song
Ah'll rock the crable when you're gone, Lawd, Lawd
Ah'll rock the crable when you're gone

It's all I can do, it's all I can say
I can't get along this away, Lawd, Lawd
I can't get along this away 

It's all I can do, it's all I can say
I'll sing it to yo' mama next pay day, Lawd, Lawd
I'll sing it to yo' mama next pay day

Who'll rock the crable, who'll sing the song
Who'll rock the crable when I'm gone, Lawd, Lawd
Who'll rock the crable when I'm goneFrom this valley they say you are going
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened oru pathways awhile

    Come and sit by my side, if you love me
    Do not hasten to bid me adieu
    Just remember the Red river valley
    And the cowboy who loved you so true

I've been thinking a long time, my darling
Of the sweet words you never would say
Now alas must my fond fopes all vanish
For they say you are going away

  

Do you think of the valley you're leaving
Oh how lonely and how dreary it will be
Do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

  

They will bury me where you have wandered
Near the hills where the daffodils grow
When you're gone from the Red river valley
For I can't live without you I knowIn a dreary Yankee prison
Whewe a Rebel soldier lay
By his side there stood a preacher
Eye his soul should pass away

And he faintly whispered Parson
As he clutched him by the hand
Oh, parson tellme quickly
Will my soul pass thru the southland

Well my soul pass thru the southland
To my old Virginia Grand
Will I see the hills of Georgia
And the green fields of Alabam

Will I see that little church house
Where I placed my heart in hand
Oh, parson, tell me quickly
Will my soul pass thru the southland

Was for lovin' dear ol' Dixie
In this dreary cell I lie
Was for lovin' dear ol' Dixie
In this northern state I'll die

Will you see my little daughter
Will you make her understand
Oh, parson, tell me quickly
Will my soul pass thru the southlandI wandered again to my home the mountain
Where in youths early drawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank stranger to me

    Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
    No mother or dad, not a friend could I see
    They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
    I found they were all rank stranger to me

They've all moved away said the voice of a stranger
To a beautiful home by the bright crystal sea
Some beautiful day, I'll meet them in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to meI was born one rainy morn
Just before my mama died
Five years daddy left me
The rain was falling down outside

    Rain oh rain leave me alone
    You're icy fingers chill my bones
    Seems trouble always comes around
    Each time the rain starts falling down

It seems the years pass by so quickly
I grew up fast I grew apart
Next thing I knew the rain was falling
Out across the prison yard

  

Now when I die make me this promise
To bury me in the darkest cave
So I may know while I am resting
No rain will fall upon my graveRailroad Bill, Railroad Bill
Live way up on Railroad Bill
Ride, ride, ride

Well, Railroad Bill, Oh, Railroad Bill
He never worked and he never will
Ride, ride, ride

Well, Railroad Bill, he was a mighty mean man
He shot the midnight lantern out of the brakeman's hand
Ride, ride, ride

Well, I'm going up on a mountain, I'm going out West
A thirty eight Special sticken' out of my vest
Ride, ride, ride

I'll buy me a pistol just as long as my arm
Kill everybody ever done me harm
Ride, ride, ride

Well, Railroad Bill, oh, Railroad Bill
He never worked, Load, he never will
Ride, ride, ride

I got a thirty eight Special on a forty five frame
How in the world can I miss him when I got dead aim
Ride, ride, ride

Well, Railroad Bill, will, he took my wife
He said if I didn't like it he would take my life
Ride, ride, ride

Well, honey, honey, do you think I'm a fool
I wouldn't quit you when the weather is cool
Ride, ride, rideWell I got me a hat an old guitar
And I made a down payment on a second hand car
I got me a job on the radio
Now I'm saving up money for a fiddle and a bow, to

    Do the radio boogie
    All over the dial
    With a solid kick and a red hot lick
    And some Tennessee style

Well early in the mountain when the sun comes up
I pull the cork from the jug
And I take a little sup
If the sun keeps a-shining I'll plow the corn
If it stars to rain
I'll just grind it in the barn

  

Well I call my gal on the telephone
What you doing, honey, are you all alone
Come on over about an hour or so
And we'll both do the boogie by the radio, we

  

Yes I got a job in a hillbilly band
I got brand new clothes, I got money to spend
And everbody asks me where we play
The radio boogie's all they can say, weThere's a rabbit in the log and I ain't got no dog
How will I get him I know ( I know )
I'll get me a briar and I'll twist it in his hair
That's how I'll get him I know
I know ( I know ) I know ( yes I know )
That's how I'll get him I know
I'll get me a briar and I'll twist it in his hair
That's how I'll get him I know

I'll build me a fire and I'll roast that old hare
Roll him in the flames to make him brown
And I'll feast here tonight while the moon's shining bright
Just find me a place to lie down
To lie down, to lie down
Find me a place to lie down
I'll feast here tonight while the moon's shining bright
Just find me a place to lie down

I'm going down the track with a chicken on my back
The soles on my shoes nearly gone
Just a little ways ahead there's an old framer's shed
That's where I'll rest my weary bones
Weart bones, weary bones
That's where I'll rest my weary bones
Just a little ways ahead there's an old farmer's shed
That's where I'll rest my weary bonesYoung man in a carriage, driving like he's mad
With a pair of horses he borrowed from his dad
He cracks his whip so lively to see his lady smile
But she know he's only putting on the style

    Putting on the agony, putting on the style
    That's what all the young folks are doing all the while
    And as I look around me, I'm very apt to smile
    To see so many people putting on the style

Sweet sixteen goes to Church just to see the boys
Laughs and giggles at every little noise
She turns this way a little, then turns that way a while
But everybody known she's only putting on the style

  

Young man in a restaurant smokes a dirty pipe
Looking like a pumpkin that's only half-way ripe
Smoking, drinking, chewing-and thinking all the while
That there is nothing equal to putting on the style

  

Young man just from college makes a big display
With a greart big jawbreak which he can hardly say
It can't be found in Webster's and won't be for a shile
But everybody know he's only putting on the style

  

Preacher in the pulpit shouting with all his might
Glory Hallelujah-puts the people in a fright
You might think that Satan's coming up and down the aisle
But it's only the preacher putting on the style

  

See the young executive in his charoal gray
Talking with some union men who've come to have their say
Sitting at his office desk and wearing a toothpaste smile
That's the executive putting on the style

  

Congressman from Washington looking mighty slick
Wants to get elected and go back there right quick
Beats his breast and hollers and waves the flag a while
But we know he's only putting on the styleCome and bathe my forehead, Mother
For I'm growing very weak
Let one drop of water, Mother
Fall upon my burning cheek
Tell I nevermore will play
Give them all my toys, but Mother
Put my little shoes away

Santa claus he brought them to me
With a lot of other things
And I think he brought an angel
With a pair of golden wings
I will be an nagel, Mother
By perhaps another day
You will do this for me, Mother
Put my little shoes away

Soon the baby will be larger
Then they'll fit his little feet
And he'll lock so nice and cunning
When he walks upon the street
I'm going to leave you, Mother
So remember what I say
You will do this for me, Mother
Put my little shoes away

Now I'm growing tired, dear Mother
Soon I'll say to you good day
Always remember what I told you
Put my little shoes away
I'm about to leave you, Mother
So remember what I say
You will do this for me, Mother
Put my little shoes awayOh, I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
Oh, I wish I had someone to live with
Cause I'm tired of living alone

Oh please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told

I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor darling alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone

Now I have a grand ship in the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
Oh that ship would be anchored and sold

Now if I had the wings of an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my darling 
And there I'd be willing to dieLast night as I lay sleeping, I dremed a dream so fair
I dreamed about my darling, the rose was in her hair
I dreamed I left this prison, started in life anew
She told me that she loved me, told me her love was beer

    It was only a dream just a prisoner's dream
    As I lay on my cold prison bed
    My dreams of you can never come true
    Dear girl, I wish that I were dead

I dreamed she called me darling, kissed me and held me tight
I dreamed that we were married, dreamed of a starry night
I dreamed about our children, playing around my knee
They loved me, called me daddy, they thought the world of me

  

I dreamed a dream so lovely, heaven on earth it seemed
My wife and little children came to me in that dream
They threw their arms around me, I was their pride and joy
My little wife she loved me, I was her darling boyPretending that I'm always happy
Pretending that I'm always gay when my heart
Inside of me is slowly dying
Every second, every minute of the day

    Pretending that I do not love you
    Pretending I am glad you're gone
    When I know that you have gone away forever
    And the pain within my heart goes on and on

Pretending that I'll soon forget you
Pretending now is all I do
For I know that you have gone away forever
The game is over, I know I've lost youPrecious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred past unfold

    Precious memories, how they linger
    How they ever flood my soul
    In the stillness of the midnight
    Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my chidhood
In fond memory appear

  

As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I pnder hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

  

In the stiliness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhereDon't forget to often pray for the boys so far away
    They have gone to fill your place out there
    They're on the battle line in defense of your and mine
    Hold 'em up to God in humble prayer

When the smoke of the battle clears oft my eyes are filled with tears
As I see some mother's son so still
I am thankful for your prayers to the one who always cares
And I play that I may do his will

  

In the beach head far away goes a boy for you today
And I know he thinks of home and you
When in prayer you're head is bowed mention those whe're out there now
Pray the Lord today to him be trueI'm a poor revel soldier a long way from home
Ain't had me no loving since the day I've been gone
Can't find me no woman in this Yankee land
There's a place in old Dixie I know where I can

Since I left old Georgia a long time ago
We run Grant's big army in the land where it snows
The cold wind is blowing and freezing the rain
But there's hot blood still running through these rebel veins

The call of the wild keeps howling to me
From the mountains down yonder in old Tennessee
Got a woman who's waiting in old Knoxville town
When night falls I'm going to be Tennessee bound

I'm a poor revel soldier and I'm going home
Cause I don't call it living when I'm living alone
Come morning they'll look, but me they won't find
I'm going to be south of that old Dixie linePoor Ellen Smith how she was found
Shot through the heart lying cold on the ground
Her clothers were all scattered and thrown on the ground
And blood marks the spot where poor Ellen was found

They picked up their rifles and hunted me down
And found me aloafign in Mount Airy town
They picked up the body and carried it away
And now she is sleeping in some lonesome old grave

I got a letter yesterday and I read it today
The flowers on her grave have all faded away
Some day I'll go home and say when I go
On poor Ellen's grave pretty flowers I'll sow

I've been in this prison for twenty long years
Each night I see Ellen through my bitter tears
The warden just told me that soon I'll be free
To go to her grave near theat old willow tree

My days in this prison are ending at last
I'll never be free from the sins of my past
Poor Ellen Smith how she was found
Shot through the heart lying cold on the groundFor your poison love has stained the life blood
    In my heart and soul dear
    And I know my life will never be the same
    For my pleading has all been in vain
    For you and you alone dear
    And you know that you are guilty fo the same

Into each life a love is born for one
And one alone dear
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul sear
And I know our love was never meant to be

  

But still my heart cries out for you
And you alone my darling
It makes me  never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And my better judgement tells me to say noPlease rememver that I love you
And I hope you'll not forget
Each hour, each day, our love grows stronger
Since the day that we first met

Nothing now can separate us
Nothing but the end of time
Please remember that I love you
Don't forget that you're all mine

When I'm holding you so close dear
Lips so sweet brush close to mine
Time stands still, my world is brighter
By a love that's so sublime

Please remember that I love you
That no one can take away
All the vows we made together
Are locked in my heart to stayNow please, don't feel sorry for me
I'm sorry we could not agree
So darlilng this is my last plea
Please don't feel sorry for me

    The love I once saw in your eye
    Has now truned to hate, so goodbye
    You've caused me enough misery
    But please don't feel sorry for me

The day that I die I'll still care
And hoping somehow you'll be there
I'm thankful for your memory
Just please don't feel sorry for meI know not where on earth to find you
I know not how or when to start
I only know I'm here without you
And there's pins and needles in my heart

The days and nights are growing longer
Since first you said that we must part
But now I know I can't forget you
With pins and needles in my heart

I always see your face before me
Your smile is heaven's work of art
But now you're smiling at another
And there's pins and needles in my heart

Someday somewhere I know I'll find you
And love will make the teardrops start
And then you'll know how long I've waited
With these pins and needles in my heartI got a pig at home in a pen
    Corn to feed him on
    All I need's a pretty little girl
    To feed I'm when I'm gone

Going up on a mountain
To sow a little cane
Put that old gray bonnet
On little Liza Jane

  

Going up on a mountain
To sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of sorghum
Sweet little Liza Jane

  

Black smoke arising
Sure sign of rain
Put that old gray bonnet
On little Liza Jane

  

Yonder comes that gal of mine
How do you think I know
Tell by that gingham gown
Hanging down so low

  

Bake them biscuits baby
Bake em good and brown
When you get them biscuits baked
We're Alabama boundIn the world's magic gallery of pictures
Are the scenes that are painted from life
There are pictures of love and of passion
There are pictures of war and of strife
There are pictures of youth and of beauty
Old age and the blushing young bride
All hang on the wall, but the saddest of all
Are the pictures of life's other side

Just a pictures of life's other side
Someone who fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day
Some poor old mother at home
Watching and waiting alone
Longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a pictures from life's other side

The first is a scene of a gambler
Who lost all his money at play
Draws his dead mother's ring from his finger
She wore it on her wedding day
His last earthly treasure, he stakes it
Bows his head that hes shame he may hide
When they lifted his head, they found he was dead
Just a pictures from life's other side

The next tells the tale of two brothers
Whose paths in different ways led
the one was in luxury living
The other one begger for his bread
One dark night they met on the highway
Your money or life, the thief cried
And he took with his knife his own brother's life
Just a picture from life's other sideWay out in Reno Nevada, where roamnceblooms and fades
A great Philadelphia lawyer was in love with a Hollywood maid
Come love and we will wander down, where the lights are bright
I'll win you a divorce from your husband, and we can get married tonight

Now, Bill was a gun toting cowboy, ten notches were carved on his gun
And all the boys around Reno left wild Bill's maiden alone
One night when he was returning from riding the range so cold
He dreamed of his Hollywood miden, her love was as lasting as gold

As he derw near her window, a shadow he saw on the shade
Was the great Philadelphia lawyer making love to his Hollywood maid
The night was as still as the desert, the moon hung bright overhead
Bill listened awhile to the lawyer, he could hear every word that he said

You hands are so pretty and lovely, your form so rare and divine
Come go wiuth me to the city and leave this wild cowboy behind
Now back in old Pennsylvania among those beautiful pines
There's one less Philadelphia lawyer in old Philadelphia tonightI've been blue in Texas, had the blues in Tennessee
Now I've got the penitentiary blues, the blues my gal gave me
I shot my gal in Georgia, steppin' out with other men
When I was going up to my work, well, another man was coming in

I took, my shiney pistol, shot my gal in the side
When I used that old forty four, well she hung her head and died
Now boys I'm here in prison and I think of my crime each day
I'm sorry now for what I've done, now I've got to pay

The judge said, boy, your sentence you'll spend your life in the pen
So let this be a lesson boys to all shootin men
Don't trust a woman anytime, if you do your bound to lose
You'll be right down here with me, baby
And you'll have the penltentiary bluesPaul and Silas bound in jail, all night long
    Paul and Silas bound in jail, all night long
    Paul and Silas bound in jail, all night long
    Who shall deliver for me ?

On the jailer cried What must I do ? all night long
Jailer cried What must I do ? all night long
Jailer cried What must I do ? all night long
Who shall deliver for me ?

  

Oh, the lightning flashed and the thunder roared all night long
Lightning flashed and the thunder roared all night long
Lightning flashed and the thunder roared all night long
Who shall deliver for meIts a mighty gard road that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled one hot, dusty road
Out of your dust bowl and westward we roll
And your deserts was hot and your mountains was cold

I have worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I've slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of the city, you will see us and then
We came with the dust and we go with the wind

California, Arizona, we make all your crops
Then its up north to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, pick the grapes from your vine
To place on your table, your light sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in this union, us migrates has been
We come with the dust, and we're gone with the wind

Well its always we ramble this river and I
All your green valleys I'll work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life need it be
For my pastures of plenty, must always be free

Yes my pastures of plenty, must always be freePassion, the flame of love, that setsmy soul on fire
Passion, flame's though my heart with only one desire
Passion, with every kiss your scorching flames they burn me
Passion, oh, won't you set me free

Passion, you make me toss and turn till break of dawn
Passion, this burning in my heart goes on and on
Passion, I am your slave why do you bother me
Passion, please won't you set me freeDaddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
    Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
    Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
    Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

When I was a boy my family would travel
Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born
There's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

  

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the avandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like anakes and we'd shoot with our postols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

  

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
They tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal til the land was forsaken
Then they wote it all down as the progress of man

  

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rocjester Dam
I'll be halfway to heaven with paradise Waiting
Just five miles away from wherever I amPanama Red, Panama Red
    He'll steal your woman then he'll rob your head
    Panama Red, Panama Red
    On his wild horse Mescalito He come breezing though town
    I bet your woman's up in bed with ol'Panama Red

The judge don't know when red' in town
He keeps well hidden underground
But everybody's acting lazy
Falling out and hanging round
Well, my woman said, he Pedro
You acting crazy like a clown
nobody feels like working
Panama Red in back in town

  

Everybody's looking out for him
Cause they know Red satisfies
Little girls love to listen to him
Sing and tell sweet lies
If ever things get too confusing, honey
We're better off in bed
And I'll be searching all the joints in town for Panama RedMake me a pallet on your floor
    Make me a pallet on your floor
    When I reach Atlanta and have no place to go
    Make me a pallet on your floor

These blues are everywhere I see
Weary blues are everywhere I see
Blues all around me, everywhere I see
Nobody's had these blues like me

  

Come all you good-time friends of mine
Come all you good-time friends of mine
When I had a dollar you treated me just fine
Where'd you go when I only had a dime

  

I'd be more than satisfied
If I could catch a train and ride
When I reach Atranta and have no place to go
Won't you make me a pallet on your floorI walked into a tavern just lookin' for some fun
With lights so dim room filled with somke her story had just begun
I listened while she told them about her life and fame
We once knew love I broke all vows her lonely heart still aches

No one will know the sleepless nights the bitter tears she sheds
Or know how many prayers for me those painted lips have said
She's dancing with a stranger and smiling all the while
Although her heart is breaking her painted lips still smile

No one will know the truth dear how I have schemed and lied
Or know the loneliness and pain that painted lips can hide
She's dancing with a stranger she'll smile and drink his wine
Hidden behind those painted lips a broken heart you'll find

So when you see a woman with painted lips so bright
Don't be to quick to judge her a lady of the night
Her smiles too often cover the sudden tears that start
Behind her painted lips you'll find a woman's broken heart

A woman's broken heart, a woman's broken heart, a woman's broken heartWhen I first I met you, right from the start
You knew that I loved you, from the pain in my heart
So look in my eyes and see that it's true
And say that you love me, please don't make me blue

    With a pain in my heart and blues on my mind
    I'll always love love you but can you be mine
    Can you be mine with another man's name
    You know that I love you and I'm not to blame

Say that you love me and you will be mine
With a pain in your heart and blues on your mind
Please say that you love me and don't say Goodbye
You know that I love you, for you I would dieI am sailling out on the ocean
Many a mile from this old place
And I wonder little darling
If I'll ever see your face

Do you remember little darling
Just how much I cared for you
When you went away and left me
Now I'm lonesome, sad and blue

I am just an lod true lover
Roming through this world alone
And I have no one to love me
Though this life I'll always roam

Do you remember little darling
On the night we said I do
Now I'm lonesome, sad, forsaken
I am lonesome without youWell I was romantic in my younger days
I courted and I married I'm sorry to say
I married a firl who was my heart's desire
Jumped out of the skillet right into the fire

Well the army was saying that they needed more men
At the recruiting station a man said step in
I signed all the papers to become a great liar
Jumped out of the skillet right into the fire

Well they sent me right quick where the bullets did fly
Made me a rifleman on the front line
I walked for miles under barded wire
To get out of the skillet right into the fire

Well if I had my choice of this army life
Or send me back home to my nagging wife
I guess I'd stay in here until I could retire
I jumped out of the skillet right into the fire

Now when I die and they lay me down I know
I hope it's above but just in case it's below
Just write on my tombstone, this boy he ain't no liar
He's been in the skillet, he's been in the fire

Law'd he's been in the skillet, he's been in the fireOh the nights are lonely here without you
All I see is grief and pain
For another love you treasure
All our hopes won't seem in vain

    For I love you as no other
    Tho' you're going far away
    Will you ever think my darling
    Of our last good bye today

I often dream of you my darling
You looked so sweet and smiled at me
And tho' another's arms may hold you
Those two blue eyes I longed to see

  

Now if you ever need me darling
Don't forget to drop a line
I'll always think of you my darling
Won't you think of me sometimeGod, he sent a loving angel
And he called our darling home
For he needed another flower
To bloom around the shining throne

But we know that he is happy
Since he left this world below
For he saw his home in heaven
Just before he had to go

He has left our home so lonely
Loneliness you could not know
But we ask that he watch o'er us
And give comfort to our soul

He's as rest on a lonely mountain
In a deep and narrow gave
And we thank our loving savior
For the comfort that he gave

Now we're here so sad and lonely
In this wicked world alone
Just a window and poor orphans
In our little mountain homeI've been driftin', I've been stealin'
I've been lonesome ,I've been talkin'
To myself and I ain't got mutch to say
I'm tired of stories and I've heard them anyway

All those people slippin' by me
Got a place that they call home
I've got nothing but my longin
And these hands to call my own

How far am I from where I began yesterday ?
How much father do I have to roam ?
I guess I'm weary of travellin'
And drinking my pay but I'm scared of the only way homeOnece more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Onece more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more

Forget the past
This hurt can't last
Oh I don't want it keep up apart
Your love I'll crave
I'll be your slave
If you'll just give me all of your heartCrying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
Oh, on that day when the bells don't toll
Crying holy unto the Lord

    Crying holy unto the Lord
    Crying holy unto the Lord
    Oh, if I could I surely would
    Stand on the rock where Moses stood

Sinners run unto the Lord
Sinners run unto the Lord
Now please don't let this pareble
Pass and lose your soul at last

  

Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying holy unto the Lord
See four and twenty elders
Bowing all around the altar crying
Holy unto the LordI can't eat and I can't sleep, all I do is sit and cry
And listen for your footsteps at my door
I've been asking myself why we ever said goodbye
And I guess I've shed a million tears of more

    On my mind, on my mind
    You're always in my heart and on my mind
    You must have tought our love had died
    But darling here's what I'm crying
    You're always in my heart and on my mind

Seem I miss you most of all when the twilight shadow fall
What a fool I was to ever let you go
If longing for you now, would only bring you back somehow
You'd be here in these empty arms, I knowHigh on the mountain, tell me what do you see
Beartracks beartracks looking back at me
Better get your rifles before its too late
The bear's got a little pig and headed for the gate

    He's big around the middle and broad across the rump
    Running ninety miles an hour taking thirty feet a jump
    Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treed
    And some folks say he looks a lot like me

Saved up my money and bought me some bees
Started making honey way up in the trees
Cut down the trees but the honey's all gone
Old slew foot has done made himself at home

  

Winter's coming on and its forty below
River's froze over so where can he go
I'll chase him up the gulley and run him in the well
Shoot him the bottom just to listen to him yellRattler was a good old dog, as blind as he could be
But every night at suppertime, I believe that dog could see

    Here, Rattler, here, here, Rattler, here
    Call old Rattler from the barn, here, Rattler, here

Rattler breaked the other night, I thought he treed a coon
When I come to find him, he's barkin' at the moon

  

Rattler was a friendly dog, even though he was blind
He wouldn't hurt a living thing, he was so very kind

  

One night I saw a big fat coon, climb into a tree
I called Ol' Rattler right away, to fetch him down for me

  

But Rattler wouldn't fetch for me, because he liked that coon
I saw them walking paw in paw, later by the light of the moon

  

Grandpa had a muley cow, muley since she was born
It took a jaybird forty years, to fly from horn to horn

  

Now old Rattler's dead and gone, like all the good dogs do
Don't put on the dog youself, or you'll be going there tooToday I burned your old love letters
I burned them gently one by one
And as I'd light the flame I'd read it
For I could see what you had done

    The first you wrote me was the sweetest
    The last one broke my heart in two
    And as I light the flame I read it
    For I can say I still love you

And as I burned your old love letters
It brought back memories from the past
It told about you sad your new love
A love I know could never lastOld Joe Clark's a fine old man
Tell you the reason why
He keeps good likker 'round his house
Good old Rock and Rye

    Fare ye well, Old Joe Clark
    Fare ye well, I say
    Fare ye well, Old Joe Clark
    I'm a going away

Old Joe Clark, the preacher's son
Preached all over the pain
The only text he ever knew
Was High, low, Jack and the game

Old Joe Clark had a mule
His name was Morgan Brown
And every tooth in that mule's head
Was sixteen inches around

Old Joe Clark had ayellow cat
She would neither sing or pray
She stuck her head in the butermilk jar
And washed her sins away

Old Joe Clark had a house
Fifteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was filled with chicken pie

I went down to Old Joe's house
He invited me to supper
I stumped my toe on the table leg
And stuck my nose in the butter

Now I wouldn't marry a widder
Tell you the reason why
She'd have so many children
They'd make those biscuits fly

Sixteen horses in my team
The leaders they are blind
And every time the sun goes down
There's a pretty girl on my mind

Eighteen miles of mountain road
And fifteen miles of sand
If ever travel this road again
I'll be a married manThere's a place in old Kentucky where I'm longing to be
Where the bluegrass is growing so fine
Where the dogwoods are in bloom in the mountains so high
Around that old home place of mine

    Oh the bluegrass is growing in the valley
    And the birds are singing in the trees
    That's where I want to go when I leave this world below
    It's home sweet home to me

Oh the good time I had playin' as a lad
They often enter my mind
Oh how long my heart did grive that day I had to leave
That dear old home place of mine

  

I remember Dad and Mom sitting there all alone
That day I left them behind
Oh how my heart does yearn for the day when I'll return
Back to that old home place of mineMany years ago, when I left my old home place
Seeking what life would behold
I bid them farewell, and left on my fourney
Not thinking of stories, my mother had told

    I'm going back, to see the old home
    I'm going back, today
    I'm going back, to see the old folks
    It's been many years, since I drifted away

I miss the old time singing, by the fireside
As darkness would steal up the lane
Old days gone by, in my memory still lingers
I'm going back to my old home, again

  

Each night I have missed, Mom kneeling by my bedside
Praying I'd always go straight
When I get back, her smile will be missing
She won't be there to welcome, me home at the gateIt's been ten long years since I left my home
In the hollow where I was born
Where the cool fall nights makes the woods glow bright
And the fox hunter blows his horn

I feel in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a job in the town

    What have you done to the old home place
    Why did they tear it down
    And why did I leave the plow in the fields
    And look for the job in the town

Well the girl ran off with somebody else
The tariffs took all my pain
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away

Now the geese fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I've lost my love I've lost my home
And now I wish that I was deadNow old Dan Tucker's fine old man
Washed hid face in a fryin' pan 
Combed his head with a wagon wheel
And died with a toothache in his heel

    Get out the way, old Dan Tucker 
    You're roo lste to ger your srpper
    Get out the way, old Dan Tucker
    You're too late to get your suppe

Now old Dan Tucker is come to town
Riding a billy goat  leading a hound
Hound dog bark and the billy goat jump
Landed Dan Tucker on top of the stump

  

Now old Dan Tucker he got drunk
Fell in the fire and kicked up a chunk
Red hot coal got in his shoe
And oh my lawd how the ashes flew

  

Now old Dan Tucker is come to town
Swinging the ladies round and round
First to the right and then to the left
Then to the girl that he loves bestthere's place dear to me where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With my friends at the old country church

    Precious years precious years, of memory sweet memory
    Oh what joy oh what joy, they bring to me they bring to me
    How I long how I long, once more to be, once more to be 
    With my friends at the old country church

As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
As I knelt at the old country church
There with Jesus above with his wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church

  

How I wish that today all the people would pray
As they did at the old country church
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did at the old country churchHad a dog and his name was Blue
Had a dog and his name was Blue
Had a dog and his name was Blue
Bet-cha five dolars he's a good dog too
Here, blue, you good dog, you

Shouldered my gun and tooted my horn
Gonna find a possum in the new ground corn
Old Blue barked and I went up to see
Cornered a possum up in a tree
Here, blue, you good dog, you

Old Blue died and he died so hard
Shook th ground in my backyard
Dug his grave with a silver spade
Lowered him down with links of chains
Here, Blue, you good dog, youOld and in the way
    That's what I heard him say
    They used to heed the words he said
    But that was yesterday
    Coal will turn to gray
    And youth will fade away
    They'll never care about you
    Cause you're old and in the way

As I hear tell he was happy
He had his share of friends and were kind
Now those freinds have all passed on
He don't have a place called home
Looking back to a better day
When you're old and in the way

  

When just a boy he left his home
Thought he'd have the world on a string
Now the years have come and gone
Through the streets he walks alone
LIke the old dog gone astray
He's just old and in the way

  

They'll never care about you
Cause you're old in the waySome people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine

    I'd give an ocean of diamonds
    A world full of flowers
    To hold you closely for just a few hours
    Hear you whisper softly
    That you love me too
    Would change all my dark skies to bluest of blue

I don't need their champagne, I don't need their wine
But if you refuse me my poor heart will pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
I'll be so lonely you'll still hear me cryThere's an old church so dear, standing lonesome and still
And in memory it's still to me
A place still so sweet for I heard as a boy
The old hymn Near my God to thee

    Oh, the wonderful, beautiful memories untold
    Oh, the m-e-m-o-r-i-e-s, untold
    Of an old fashioned church, yes Oak Grove Church of old
    Oak g-r-o-v-e Church of old
    Will live on till the end of time
    For my wonderful, heavenly Saviour was there
    S-a-v-i-o-r was there
    Each time, yes each time that old church bell would toll
    Each time the bell tolled
    Looking for his lost sheep to find

There I heard Daddy pray and I heard Mother sing
With the tears runing down their face
Many now have passed on, who's souls there were saved
While we all sang Amazing Grace

  

There is still an Oak Grove where I played as a boy
And I'm sure there is still a well
And I know every spring sweetly still the birds sing
Some will nest in the old church bellNo not a word, no not a word
    No not a word from home anyhome

If only I could hear, just one little word
From mother and daddy my heart
Would fill with cheer 
Each day I take a walk
I travel down the trail
Each day the postman tells me
No letter in the mail

  

If only I could hear one little
Word from home
My heart would be so flattered
I never more would roam
The days have turned to weeks
The weeks have turned to years
Without one little word
From ones I love so dear

  

The last time mother wrote
They were all okay
But I'm getting worried
They're getting old and gray
Each night I say a player
And I always say
I'll start home tomorrow
I can't live on this way

  * RerfrainNobody's love is like mine
    No one's so faithful and kind
    Love that is true as the ocean
    But nobody's love is like mine

They tell me that you found another
And now you'll be going far away
Why have you left me little darling
I love you both night and day

  

I guess now I'll just go on dreaming
And wondering why I couldn't be
Some day little darling you'll be sorry
Far the way you treated meOut in this cold world alone
Wandering about on the street
Asking a penny for bread
Begging for something to eat

    I'm nobody's darling on earth
    Heaven have mercy on me
    For I'm nobody's darling
    Nobody cares for me

When I was but a young lad
Mother was taken from home
Now I have no one to love me
No one to call me their own

  

While others are slooping so sound
Or dreaming of silver and gold
I'm out in this cold world alone
Wandering about in the cold

  

If I'm fortunate enough
To get to the Heavenly home
I will have some one to love me
Some one to call me their ownCome sit by my side little darling
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
Promise me that you will never
Be nobody's darling but mine

Nobody's darling but mine love
Be honest, be faithful, be kind
Promise me that you will never
Be nobody's carling but mine

You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime
You're as pure as the dew from the rose
I'd rather be somebody's darling
That a poor boy that nobody knows

My mother is dead and in heaven
My daddy has gone down below
Sister has gone to meet mother
And where I'll go nobody knows

Goodbye, goodbye little darling
I'm leaving this cold world behind
Promise me that you will never
Be nobody's darling but mineI was slowly passing by
An orphan's home one day
And I stopped there for a moment
To watch the children play
Alone a little boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He truned to me, but did not speak
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
I'm like a flower
Just growing wild
No mommy's kisses
And no body's smiles
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

People come for children
And take them for their own
Then they have a mom and dad
And a fine home
I know they like my golden curls
But when they see I'm blind
They always take some other shild
And I am left behindNobody's business, nobody's business, nobody's business what I do
    Nobody's business, nobody's business, nobody's business what I do

My gal drives a Cadillac, I walk the railroad track
It's nobody's business what I do
She drives a limousine, I buy the gasoline
It's nobody's business what I do

  

Earl says, boys let's leave a eight
Flatt say, that's too late
It's nobody's business what I do
And we say, well what the heck
But they're guys who sign the check
So I guess it's their business what we doNobody loves me, nobody cares
If life is empty and full of tears
I longed for true love, searched everywhere
Nobody loves me, nobody cares

Seaching for true love has been in vain
Two years my heart has suffered with pain
Lifes lonesome burden now I must bear
Nobody loves me, nobody cares

Nights on my pillow, I dream of love
though space I gaze at the stars above
They seem to whisper from way up there
Nobody loves you, nobody cares

A lonsome heart and a troubled mind
In this old world now is all find
I look to heaven for I know there
Someone will love, someone will careNo one to kiss me goodnight
    Alone I lay on my bed
    Longing to hear from my darling
    I'm praying tonight he's not dead

Viet Nam called, and he went to serve
As all true Americans do
Now he's in a strange land there fighting
Protecting the red, white and blue

  

I remember the day, that he said
For awhile, I must go far away
To fight for my loved ones and freedom
Just pray that I'll come back someday

  

I want for a letter each day
The postman keeps passing me by
That's why I'm so blue and so lonesome
And praying tonight, he won't dieMother and I were all alone
We had no place to call our own
It'll never be like home no more
Till we get on that other shore

    Oh, mother dear and daddy to
    We wish that we were there with you
    It's not the same since you're away
    We'll see you mother and dad some day

Mother and dad were growing old
It hurt us so to see them go
It's not the same since they're gone
Oh, mother and dad we're so slone

  

Our little house is trmbled down
Since mother and dad are not around
For its a home without a friend
I could never go back home againNo more lonely night
No more sad goodbyes
Now that you're mine
There'll be no more lonely nights
The rain just cleared this morning
You can see almost a hundred miles
Through the warm clean air
It's been years I sweat
And I can wake-up
Feeling easy now
And take it with a smile
Cause I'm the only one
In her eyes
In her eyes

    No more lonely nights
    Bring on that old moonlight
    What I thought I'd lost forever
    Just walked back in sight
    No more lonely nights
    No more sad goodbyes
    Now that you're mine
    There'll be no more lonely nights

All there broken hearted people
Just keep knocking on my door
I know that long sad face
They're all over the place
And as for me
I'm falling deep in love
I'm finally off the floor
And there'll be no more heartaches
Anyomre
NevermoreSister Mary, she wears a golden chain
Sister Mary, she wears a golden chain
Sister Mary, she wears a golden chain
On every link there's Jesus name
There's no hiding place down here

    There's no hiding place down ground
    There's no hiding place down ground
    Well, I run to the rocks and I hide my face
    The rocks cried out, No hiding place
    There's no hiding place down here

I'll pitch tent on the old camp ground
I'll pitch tent on the old camp ground
I'll pitch tent on the old camp ground
I'll give old Satan old more round
There's no hiding place down here

  

Oh, the devil, he wears a hypocrite's shoe
The devil, he wears a hypocrite's shoe
The devil wears hypocrite's shoe
If you don't watch, he'll slip it on you
There's no hiding place down hereI think you're the sweetest thing and I like your talk
I like your curly hair honey and I like your walk
I like the way you hold me I like your eyes of blre
There's no doubt it honey, I'm in love with you

    Ho when you hold me, my poor heart skips a blue
    When you kiss me it knocks me off my feet
    I like your little srories, I like everything you do
    There's no doubt about it, I'm crazy over you

I like the way you smile I like your dimpled chin
I like to see you laugh and I like to see you grin
I like the way you hold me I like everything you do
There's no doubt about it, I'm crazy over youThis nine pound hammeris a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

    Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
    Baby, how can I roll when the wheels won't go

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

  

It's a long way to Hazard a long way to Harian
Just to get a little booze, just get a little booz

 

  

Ain't one hammer in this tonnel
That rings like mine that rings like mine

  

It rings like silver and shines like gold
It rings like silver and shines like gold

  

Somebody stole my nine pound hammer
They've took it and gone, they've took it and gone

  

That nine pound hammer that killed John Henry
Ain't a gonna kill me, ain't a gonna kill meBig city nights
Cold and brught
Husting through the crowd
Jammed-up freeways
You gotta stand in line

So give me sweet warm nights in Oklahoma
I'm so tired of feeling alone
And when the moon climbs over Texoma
We'll be on our way back home
We're on our way back home

Southern wind
Blow on in
Lord, it's been so long
I've said goodbye
To those smoggy skies
Now I'm moving on

To those sweet warm nights in Oklahoma
I'm so tired of feeling alone
And when the moon climbs over Texoma
We'll be on our way back home
We're on our way back homeI'm riding on that new river train
    Riding on that new river train
    Same old train that brought me here
    Gonna take me away again

Darling, you can't love one
Darling, you can't love one
You can't love one and have any fun
Darling, you can't love one

  

Darling, you can't love two
Darling, you can't love two
You can't love two and still be true
Darling, you can't love two

You can't love six, for that kind of love don't mix
Darling, you can't love sixOh ring, or ring new freedom bell
    So we will know that all is well
    Its name is there for all to see
    In the land of the happy and free

Now have you found that freedom soul
The Liberty Bell it may sow
So it may ring throughout the land
And we will know that freedom will stand

  

It hangs so high in the city of Berlin
Not so long ago was a city of sin
But freecom won and all is well
There now hangs the new freedom bellI've got a new black suit in a box on the shelf
It's she first new suit ever bought for myself
If it was gray or blue I would think it a prize
But that new black suit brings tears to my eyes

    Mama's dying, mama's dying
    And I just can't stand the thought
    How can I bear it, must I wear it
    That new black suit I bought

I was just last night the doctor looked at me and said
Son I've done all I can soon your mom will be dead
So I sent for the preacher and called up the kin
Before long, one by one, they'll all start comming in 

  

In that new black suit that I couldn't afford
I watched them carry my mom as she goes to the lord
Then I'll think about Heaven and try not to cry
As I stand by her for that last good-byeI used to take you in my arms and hold you close to me
I used to tell you how I cared how happy we could be
Bue someone else has won your heart and knocking at your door
And I never get to hold you in my arms anymore

I tried a million times or more to forget about the past
But it seems to me your memories are the ones that always last
I lie awake and cry for you and sometimes walk the floor
But I never get to hold you in my arms anymore

I'll step aside and give you up, although it makes me blue
You'll never know how much it hurts to see him holding you
I'll always care and always love you just as before
But I'll never get to hold you in my arms anymoreThe stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love
I thought was true and so divine

    So never again, oh never no more
    Never again will I knock upon your door
    Never again but these words I can say
    I'll try not to love and stay out of your way

We had the greatest start but deep within your heart
You led me on before I knew the score
You cheated and you lied stayed right by your side
Until one day simply closed the doorMy walking shoes don't fit me anymore
    My walking shoes don't fit me anymore
    Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around
    My walking shoes don't fit me anymore

It's long way from here to over yonder
My feet they're getting mighty sore
I ain't coming back you've made your mind to wander
My walking shoes don't fit me anymore

  

I'll be a longtime gone from you baby
You'll never here me knock upon your door
I thought you were worth it once but I was crazy
My walking shoes don't fit me anymoreSittin'on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straight-back chair on two legs  leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playin' with june bugs on the string
And catch the glowin'firelies when evening shadows fall

    In my Tennessee mountain home
    Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
    In my Tennessee mountain home
    Crickets singing in the fields nearby

Honeysuckle vines cling to the fences along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings
And a songbird on a fence post sings a melody

  

Walkin'home from charch on sunday with the one you love
Just laughin,'talkin' makin'future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin' you might steal a kiss or two
Just sittin'in the porchswing holdin' handsYou're my sweet blue eyed darling
    And my love belongs to you
    All I ask of you my darling
    Is love me good and be true

Days come and go and I still love you
And I see your smiling face
Tell me love that you need me
And no one's going to take your place

   

And today I need an answer
And I want to hear you say
That you don't belong to another
And in my heart you're gonna stayOh rockaby my Saro Jane
	Rockaby my Saro Jane
	Nothing to do but sit aroundand sing
	Rockaby my Saro Jane

I met a gal who's sweet to me
She lives down in Tennessee
Oh, Saro Jane
Nothing to do but sit around and sing
Rockaby my Saro Jane

  

I've been around here all my life
All that's left is just one wife
Oh, Saro Jane
Nothing to do but sit around and sing
Rockaby my Saro Jane

  

Now you get a line and I'll get a pole
We'll go down to the fishing hole
Oh, Saro Jane
Nothing to do but sit around and sing
Rockaby my Saro JaneShe bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vow we'd love each other
And I hope we always will

    She's my rose of old Kentucky
    I watched her bloom as the years rolled by
    And to me there will never be another
    I'll love her till the day I die

Oh, in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh, how I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more than real

  

Oh, I know you often wondered
So I'll tell you the reason why
She is my rose of old Kentucky
And I know she will never lieWhen my heart was black with sin
And I had no peace within
I didn't know that Jesus lives today
I was deep in the miry clay
Then Jesus set me free one day
I know, my Redeemer lives today

    I know, I know my Redeemer lives today
    I know, I know, no matter what men may say 
    For Jesus cleansed my soul from sin
    Made me pure and whole within
    I know, I know, my Redeemer lives today

Now there is peace within my heart
From now on I'll do my part
I know that Jesus lives today
I know he left this world of sin
But soon He's coming back again
I know, I know, my Redeemer lives todayHe was a man and a friend always
He stuck with me in the hard old days
He never cared if I had no dough
We rambled around in the rain and snow

    And here's to you, my rambling boy
    May all your rambling bring you joy
    Here's to you, my rambling boy
    May all your rambling bring you joy

In Tulsa town we chanced to stray
We thought we'd try to work one day
The boss said he had room for one
Said my old pal we'd rather bum

  

Late one night in a jungle camp
The weather it was cold and damp
He got the chills and he got 'em bad
They took the only friend I had

  

He let me here to ramble on
My rambling pal is dead and gone
If when we die we go somewhere
I bet you a dollar he's a rambling thereI've got an old log cabin by the side of the road
And you're welcome to rest there if you bear a heavy load
There's a picture of Jesus hanging over my door
And I talk to my Savior from my knees on the floor

Many years I have lived here just struggling along
Once the walls shook with laughter they heard many a song
It seen the joys of my family, shared my grief since they're gone
Kept me dry from the rain, weathered many a storm

I'm just an old feeble man now, not much father to go
Soon my savior's gonna call me for He's often told me so
I'll just stay in my cabin till I've lived my life's span
And in my Savior's name I'll do all taht I can

It heard me sing Rock of Ages and the Old Rugged Cross
Heard me pray for many people who's soul thought was lost
Seen me welcome many strangers who needed help on their way
Will see the angels come for me when I've lived my last dayWell I've been working all week long
But tonight is wine, women and song
Gonna get me a jug get away from it all
Gotta pocket full of money and I'm feeling mean
Gonna give this town something it ain't see
This country boy is really gonna have a ball

    I'm gonna play loud music
    Gonna drink hard liquor
    Gonna chase wild women
    Tonight's my night to howl

Well I'm gonna be where there's lights and smoke
Ain't gonna home til I'm flat broke
Gonna trun this town ever way but loose
Turn the juke box up til I can't think
Mr.bartender bring another drink
Cause I may wind up sleeping in the calabooseI'd like to see my native home
The lofty trees, that golden asnd
The rugged hills all crowded round
My mother's voice how sweet would sound

Sometimes I dream of home and friends
My dreams are false my heart is grim
And when i wake I'm all alone
My dreams are false my freinds are gone

I'd like to see my hearts delight
Her beautiful face and eyes so bright
And how she'd smile as I drew near
I'd kiss her with a fallen tear

It fills my heart with fondest love
To listen to that lonesome dove
He mourns as if his mate was gone
As if like me left all alone

Nine or ten years have passed and gone
And I'm still left here all alone
Oh I'd like to see my native home
Among your hills I'd love to roamLost all my money but a two dollar bill
    Two dollar bll, boys, two dollar bill
    Lost all my money but a two dollar bill
    I'm on my long journey home

Cloudy in the west and it looks like rain
Looks like rain, boy, it looks like rain
Cloudy in the west and it looks like rain
I'm on my long journey home

  

Black some a-risin', and it surely is a train
Surely is a train, boys, surely is a train
Black some a-risin', and it surely is a train
I'm on my long journey home

  

I hear the train a-comin', and I'll soon be gone
Soon be gone, lord, soon be gone
I hear the train a-comin', and I'll soon be gone
I'm on my long journey home

  

Homesick and lonesome and a-feeling kind of blue
Feeling kind of blue, lord, feeling kind of blue
Homesick and lonesome and a-feeling kind of blue
I'm on my long journey home

  

It's dark and a-rainin' and I've got to go home
Got go home, boys, got go home
It's dark and a-rainin' and I've got to go home
I'm on my long journey homeMy little sweetheart of the mountains
With hair as red as anybody's
And her lips as sweet as honey
She shines like the morning stars

    Meet me out in the Blue Ridge Mountains
    Underneath the lonesome pine
    We'll settle down up there forever
    Mary Jane won't you be mine

I'm going back to North Carolina
Where the mountain tops are blue
Mary Jane you know I love you
And I'm coming back to youMy houses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
So fare you well Polly, I'm going away
Your parents don't like me, they say I'm too poor
They say I'm not worthy to enter your door

My parents don't like you, you're poor I am told
But it's your love I'm waiting, not silver or gold
Then come with me Polly, we'll ride till we come
To some little cabin, we'll call it our home

Sparking is pleasure, but parting is grief
And a false headed lover is worse than a thief
A thief will just rob you and take what you have
But a faise hearted lover will lead you to the graveMy home's across the smorky mountain
My home's across the smorky mountain
My home's across the smorky mountain
And I'll never get to see you any more, more, more
I'll never get to see you any more

Goodbye honey, suger darling
Goodbye honey, suger darling
Goodbye honey, suger darling
And I'll never get to see you any more, more, more
I'll never get to see you sny more

Rock my baby, feed her candy
Rock my baby, feed her candy
Rock my baby, feed her candy
And I'll never get to see you any more, more, more
I'll never get to see you any moreI want to go back my home in the mountains
Where shade trees grow all around
Where grass grows so green and flowers are still blooming
I'm leaving and that's where I'm bound

    I'm only a mand I don't care for riches
    I'm tired of living this way
    I'm going back to my home in the mountains
    And this time I'm going to stay

I want to be free where the birds are still singing
And whippoorwill's call out at night
The air is still clear and neighbors say howdy
And stars in Heaven shine brightTheres a gig bright moon tonight
And it's shining just right
Just let me hold you tight
and tell you of your charms
It don't matter to me just now
If you've broken every vow
just let me take you
In my empty arms

You can put the blame on me
If you heart desires
I love you more and more
I'll prove it by the stars
Do you recall the time
You said I'd have to pay
I'm left here all alone
There hard hard world to sayOur love first start started from childhood days
And parting brought me pain
I'd live for you and no other one
Sin would not have been to blame

    I know I'm on my dying bed
    I beg you to kneel down and pray
    With love from you and the help of God
    May save my soul today

If I die this way my sould will be lost
I hear old Satan calling me
It sound so different from Got I know 
Oh, Lord, please set me free

  

My friends were here and prayed for me
The lights are fading low
My heart feels light and my sould is not doomed
Dear God, I'm ready to goMy Deceitful heart keeps changing its mind
    Hurtin everyone but me
    Each time I fall in love it's soon that I find
    My fickle heart longs to be free

Don't fall in love with me
Let me warn you from the start
I'm so in love with you but I know I'll break your neart
Yes, I'll only break your heart

  

Gee but your wonderful
And I like to make you mine
But I don't think my love could ever stand the test of time
Cold stand the test of mineNow darling, you know that I love you
    And hope you will love me sometime
    Now darling you know that I trust you
    And I hope you will soon change your mind

I wish we were both here together
While I'm writing the words to this song
But if you could write me a letter
Then it wouldn't seem so very long

  

Remember when we were together
You said you'd come back some day
I'm saving all my love for you darling
And that's all that I can ever say

  

If you ever change your mind dear
And feel that you want someone new
Just tell me all about your little secret
Then I won't feel so sad and so blueNow I just heard my darlilng's last goodbye
Her precious lips can speak to me no more
The teardrops stain my cheeks although I tried
To remember that we'll meet on heaven's shore

    The vows we said as planned today
    So she would know no one could take her place
    My love so young and fair was called away
    And I'm left an empty life to face

I know someday I'll leave this empty life
To join my precious sweetheart up on high
Till then I'll bear the sorrow and the strife
For I just heard my darling's last goodbyeFar away upon a hill on a sunny mountain side
Many years ago we parted, my own true love and I
From the sunny mountain side
Oh she clung to me and trembled, when I told her we must part
And she said don't go my darling I know twill break my heart
When we two are far apart

    Carry me back to old Virginia back to my clinch mountain home
    Carry me back to lod Virginia back to my old mountain home
    My mother's old and feeble and my father's getting gray
    Carry me back to lod Virginia fot its there I want to stay

Oh I held her in my arms leaned her head upon my breast
And I told her that I'd wed her when I come back from the west
To my old clinch mountain home
In my hand I hold a picture of the old home far away
And the picture of my sweetheart I'm thinking of today
On the sunny mountain sideWell, I went upon a mountain, I looked down in the sea
I seen the crabs and the fishes doing the beebop beep
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it, yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it, I can't buy no beer

    Yeah! My bucket's got a hole in it
    Yeah! My bucket's got a hole in it
    Yeah! My bucket's got a hole in it
    I can't buy no beer

Well, I'm standing on the corner with a bucket in my hand
I'm a-waiting for a woman that ain't got no man
Cause my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it, I can't buy no beer

  

Well, there ain't no use for me a-working so hard
When I got a woman in the boss man's yard
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it, yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it, I can't buy no beer

  

Well, me and my baby, we just bought a Ford
And now we sit together on the running board
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it, yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it, I can't buy no beerI'll never forget the morning you left me
I tried to smile, but instead I cried
I couldn't hold my tears no longer
The moment you told me goodbye

My brown eyed darling, you know I love you
I'll always be faithful and true
Though tonight you're miles away, dear
I want you back, dear, I'll be true

My darling, I hope you will trust me
Cause I'll be waiting just for you
Night after night upon my bed, dear
I tried to sleep, but I can't for you

I know I can depend on you dear
I hope now soon you'll come back home
I'm hoping and praying for you, my darling
And the day I'll call you my ownMy brother and I were out hunting
A stray bullet made him it's mark
I carried him back to the cabin
His life nothing more that a spark

He whispered to me very softly
Dear brother I'm going away
So listen and come to me closely
There's so much that I have to say

My sweetheart her pure name is Sally
Her Mother and Father have died
She's waiting alone in the valley
When I left her oh how she cried

I've promised to bring her my fortune
Return to the valley and wed
But I've had a call from my Maker
So I'll have to go there instead

He gave me the ring he had bought her
And told of the plans they had made
He spoke of how long she had waited
And for his return how she prayed

He gave me a small piece of paper
The will he had made for this day
I promised to do as he wanted
The good Lord would show me the way

He gave me his home in the valley
And all of the money he had
He asked me to marry his Sally
And promise she'd never be sad

But once long ago we were rivals
For I loved her too from the start
I made up my mind to stay single
For Sally had broken my heartHold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still
    Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
    Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun
    My world has ended my baby's gone

The milkman whistles softly as he cames up to my door
The mailman brings the letters by just like he did before
They seem so busy all day long as though there's nothing wrong
Don't they know my world has ended my baby's gone

  

I wake up sometimes in the night and realize you're gone
Then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come
I try to tell my broken heart it must go on alone
When it finds the world has ended my baby's goneIn time my aching heart will mend
Through all the sorrow that I'm in
And then I'll see the light sweetheart
For someone you will take their place

    Oh, I'll stand up and be brave
    I'll grieve each minute of the way
    And oh the day my tears will dry
    I'll forget I've ever lived this lie

I'll pay the price for lovin' you
And live in dreams that could not be
I never thought it'd end this way
But I will smile again somedayGood morning captain
Good morning son
Godd morning captain
Good morning son

Well, I'm leaving here and I

I'm leaving here and I
Ain't gonna take no clothes
There may be good times in this old town
But it's better on down the rordEngineer reach up and pull the whistle
    Let me hear that lonesome sound
    For it blends with the feeling that's in me
    The one I love has turned me down

I'm gonna catch me a freight train
Lord, I'm leaving this lonesome town
The one I loved andgave my heart to
That's the one that turned me down

  

There's sixteen cars behind each engine
I ride the last one to the end of the line
I don't know where I'm going or where I'll wind up
Just anything to ease my worried mindWell, hello Mr.Bottle
We seem to meet again
Today has been a long day
Thought it would never end
I knew that you'd be waiting
You never turn me down
I'm gonna tell you, all my troubles
In you I'll let them drown

    An empty bottle on the table
    And the juke box plays too loud
    I seem to be so all alone
    Even though I'm with a crowd
    If I see my baby's sweet face
    Coming through that door
    I wouldn't have to drown my sorrow
    In Mr.Bottle anymore

Now listen, Mr.Bottle
I think you are my friend
You've helped me over troubles
That never seem to end
I've searched my mind, so many times
To see if I was wrong
Now it doesn't seem to matter
I just want my baby homeI met the girl named Jole Blon and I know her sister too
I met Ann from Old Cheyenne and I know Sue City Sue
There's sweet Marie from Tennessee and Louisiana Lou
I know them all from A to Z and I met Miss Molly too
But of all the pretty girls I met, there's just one girl for me
She lives away back in the hills, my Mountain Rosa Lee
Her fair is dark and curly and her eyes are big and blue
Raised on corn and taters and she loves her mountain dew

    Mountain sweet heart, Mountain Rosa Lee
    Hillbilly baby waiting there for me
    Cheeks are red as reses and lips are meant for me
    Hillbilly baby my Mountain Rosa Lee

There's Texas Red in Texas, they say she's out of sight
Pistol Packing Mama full of dynamite
Sadie from Missouri as fine as she can be
But none can satisfy me like my Mountain Rosa Lee
Now you can have your Texas gals and Louisiana Lou
I'll give you Miss Molly and sweet Sue City Sue
I'll give you Ann from Old Cheyenne and Marie from Tennessee
I'm going back to the mountains and Marry Rosa LeeThere's a little road back in the mountains
That I traveled on, when just a Kid
Many years ago, I was bound to travel
Now I'm sorry for the things I did

I remember how my Mom was weeping
As she held me close whispered son don't go
And Daddy's out stretched hand was trembling
His heart was breaking now I know

I was all they had to love and cherish
I was all they had to bring them
I took away as a wondering boy

After many years I came to see them
My joy to grief turned like a stone
Two graves with words, please hurry home son
We're waiting fot you by your mountain roadLike the Mountain Laurel in the grove dear
My love is, is ever green
Like the Mountain Laurel finds the grove dear
I'll find you again

Where the mountain breezes blow
There's a place I long to go
You'll be waiting there I know
In the pine and we'll climb

Into the hills we knew in days gone by
When your heart was gay and so was I
And we'll find a love we left behind
Long ago, long agoThere's a big hollow tree down the road here from me
Where you lay down a dollar or two
You stoll 'round the bend and you come back again
There's a jug full of good old mountain dew

    They call it that mountain dew
    And them that refuse it are few
    You may go 'round the bend
    But you'll come back again
    For that good old mountain dew

My uncle Nort,he's sawed off and short
He measures about four foot two
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint
Of that good old mountain dew

  

Well, my old aunt June bought some brand new perfume
If had such a sweet smeling pew
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed
It was nothin' but good old mountain dew

  

Well, the preacher rode by with his head histed high
Said his wife had been with the flu
And he thought that I ort just to give him a quart
Of that good old mountain dew

  

Well, my brother Bill's got a still on the hill
Where he runs sff a fallon or two
The buzzards in the sky get so drunk they can't fly
From smeling that good old mountain dewWell, I left my old home back in the mountains
For mother and father had both passed away
We followed our mother up to the graveyard
For mother wews called to Heaven that day

    Mother's not dead, she's only a-sleeping
    Just patiently waiting for Jesus to come
    The birds will be singing while mother is sleeping
    They will sing o're her as the grave sinks a-way

Oh, how we miss her round the old home place
Everything seems so lonesome since she went away
Mother is sleeping way back in the mountains
Yes, Mother is sleeping way back in the hillsThere's a book that Mother left me
That grows sweeter every day
I have often read the pages
Since my Mother passed away
When but just a baby boy
I would sit upon her knee
Mother looked just like an angel
When she read this book to me

    Mother's bible  Oh, how dear
    With the covers, Worn and old
    Mother's bible  Much more sweeter
    Worth much more  To me than gold
    And she told me  Yes she told me
    Just before she went to sleep
    If I read it  and believed it
    Jesus then my soul would keep

Now my Mother's gone to heaven
And some times I feels so sad
Then I go get Mother's bible
That she left for me and Dad
Though the years there may be changes
But one change there'll never be
It's that old and faded bible
That my Mother left for meWhile kneeling by her beside in a cottage on the hill
My mother prayed her blessing for me there
She was talking then with Jesus whlie everything still
And I heard my mother call my name in prayer

    Yes, I heard my mother call my name in prayer
    She was pouring out her heart to Jesus there
    Then I gave my heart to Him and He saved my soul from sin
    For I heard my mother call my name in prayer

She was anxious for her boy to be just what he ought to be
And she asked the lord to take Him in His care
Just the worlds I can't remember but I know she preyer for me
For I heard my mother call my name in played

  

Then I gave my heart to Jesus and I'm living now for him
And someday I'll go and meet him in the air
For he heard my mother praying and he saved my soul from sin
Yes, he heard my mother call my name in prayerThe night Mother died it broke my Daddy's heart
In anguish he bowed his gray head
And the pitiful way he kept calling her name
I can't believe my angel is dead

The sprakle that once shined in my Daddy's eyes
And the spring he once had in his walk
Was replaced with a far away look on his face
As often of my sweet Mother we'd talk

Then the night finally came I was called to his sic
On his face was a heavenly smile
Then he reached for my hand and said Son with a smile
In heaven I'll see our sweet angel tonightMy mama told me last night
She gave me good advice
Better stop your rambling round, pretty boy
And marry you a loveing wife

Look down that lonesome road
Hang down your little head and cry
For thinking of those pretty little girls
And hoping I never will die

Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
I'm leaving you this lonesome song
To sing when I am gone

There's more pretty girls than one
There's more pretty girls than one
For every town I rambled around
There's more pretty girls than oneThere's an old saying that's been all around
I heard before I could walk
How somes got wealth and some's got health
Other's money, marbles and chalk

    I've got money, marbles and chalk sweetheart
    But I still feel like I am poor
    For my money won't spend and my marbles won't roll
    And my chalk won't anymore

While you were here I was happy and gay
Your presence made me for another one day
But you left me for another one day
Now I feel so alone in a crowd

  

Money, marbles and chalk is alright
For a miser who loves only gold
But give me a chance to save our romance
For I love you with all of my soulThe warship had landed and I'd come ashore
The fighting was over for me evermore
For I had been wounded they left me for dead
A stone for me pillow and snow for me bed

    The enemy found me and took me away
    And made me a prisoner of war so they say
    But God in his mercy was with me one day
    The gate was left open and I ran away

I return to the old home my sweet wife to see
The home I had build for my darling and me
The door I then opened and there on the stand
I saw a picture of her and I ran away

  

The clothes she was wearing told me the sad tale
My sarling was wearing a new bridal veil
Then I found a letter and these words I read
Missing in action she thought I was dead

  

So I kissed her picture and whispered good bye
My poor heart was breaking but my eyes were dry
I know she'd be happy if she never learned
I know she must never know I had returned

  

A vagabond dreamer forever I'll roam
Because there was no one to welcome me home

  

The face of my darling no more I shall see
For missing in action forever I'll beMilwaukee's where we before we came here
Working in a brewery, making the finest beer
She came to me on a payday night, said let's go to Tennessee
So we went down to Nashville to Grand Ole Opery

    I'm gonna get on the old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
    I'm gonna leave this town till you decide
    Which one you want the most, them Opery stars or me
    Mulwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee

We turned on the TV, Minnie Pearl was talking loud
I said she's the woman for me, I love her,there's no doubt
I'm leaving here right now to find out where she's at and if I can find her
I'll settle for little pretty Tammy Wynette

  

I'm going now and trade my old ford for an Olds
I might get all drunked up and trade it for a Rolls
One thing I know for sure, I'll always be blue
There ain't no way to get drunk enough to stop my loving youWay down in the State of Georgia
Through the swamp and Everglades
There's a hole in Plager Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave

I had a girl in Waycross, Georgia
But she had unfaithful ways
She let me feel I was unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave

I couldn't stand the way she did me
I couldn't take her low down ways
Before I'll stay with a cheating woman
I'll go live with the bears in Miller's Cave

I caught her out one Sunday morning
With a man they called Big Dave
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave

I said you'll pay both you and David
I'm gonna see you in your hrave
They laughed at me and then I shot um
I took their cheating scheming bones to Miller's Cave

They come and made me feel unwanted
But I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the State of Georgia
They'll never find me cause I'm lost in Miller's CaveWell you wake up in morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go a-marching to the table
See the same damn thing
Well, it's on a one table
Knife, a fork and a pan
And if you say anything about it
You're in trouble with the man

    Let the midnight special
    Shine her light on me
    Let the midnight special
    Shine her ever loving light on me

If you ever go to Houston
You better walk right
You better not stagger
You better not fight
Sheriff Benson will arrest you
He'll carry you down
And if the jury finds you guilty
Penitentiary bound

  

Yonder come little Rosie
How in the world do you know
I can tell her by her apron
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Plece of paper in her hand
She goes a-marching to the captain
Says I want my manWas midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I keep
But to think of her I left behind
And saked if she'd be true and kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And hold me to her loving breast

Oh Willie, don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep, deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will sometimes stray
To thee when thou art far away

I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as thine
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine

Then fare thee well, I'd rather make
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refuse to shine
Than to trust a love so false as thineDo you ever feel lonesome
And you're down in San Antone
Beg, steal or borrow two nickels or a dime
Call me on the phone
I'll meet you at Alamo Mission
We can say our prayers
The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will hear us
As we kneel there

    In the moonlight, in the midnight
    In the moonlight midnight moonlight
    In the moonlight, in the midnight
    In the moonlight midnight moonlight

Did you ever feel sorrow
For the deeds you have done
With no hope for tomorrow
In the setting of the sun
And the ocean is howling
With things that might have been
And that last good morning, sunrise
Would be the brightest you've ever seenOooooooo Midnight flyer
    Engineer won't you let your whistle moan
    Oooooooo Midnight flyer
    I paid my dues and I feel like travelin on

A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man and pull him down your way
Make him into someone to take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted to to be

  

Maybe I'll stop in Santa Fe maybe San Antonio
Any town is where I'm bound anyway to get me gone
Don't think about me never let me cross your mind
Except when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whineYou're a midnight angel at twelve is when you start
Looking for a victim to feed your hungry heart
You say you don't love me still I wait all alone
For my midnight angel to come home

It seems I spened a lifetime between midnight and dawn
Watching from my window for a man to bring you home
Listening to the silence while waiting all alone
For my midnight angel to come homeI can't forget you little darlin
Each night you're always in my dreams
Your face is always here before me
On thru the years with you I'll dream

    How we used to love each other
    It's just memories of the past
    I should have known you were false hearted
    That our love would never last

Each night I go down to the bar room
There I'll drink the warm red wine
And I'll play the lonesome jukebox
For your love is on my mindMother left this world of sorrow
Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home, no mother or dad

    There's a little lonesome graveyard
    And two tombstones there they say
    Oh, mother's Gone but not forgotten
    Oh, dad's We'll meet again some day

I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laid them down to rest
I can almost here them down to rest
Trust in God he'll do the rest

  

Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they rest with God above
And they'll meet with friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious loveOn a dark stormy night the an gles called Mother
The love that we shared for such a short while
She called us around and then told us she's leaving
And then closing her eyes she went with a smile

    Mother's rest in a lonesome old graveyard
    On a hill far away there stands her white tomb
    With the grass covered o'er it seems so neglected
    When spring seasons come sweet flowers will bloom

I'll never forget the love Mother gave us
As children we played around our old home
I know her reward is a mansion in heaven
While children on earth are scattered and goneMemories, memories
    Memories of the one that I let go
    Memories, memories
    Memories of the one I still love so

My arms can't hold a memory
There's nothing there to hold
And thoughts of you can't warm me
When the nights are dark and cold
My lips can't kiss a memory
It has no lips to kiss
And just how long will I go on
With memories like this

  

Memories of the one I still love soThe time has come to say goodbye
I hate to part, this way
Our parting ways, have met again
This is goodbye today

    Maybe you will change your mind
    And if you do, someday you'll find
    That I was right, and you were wrong
    About the tie, that binds

The tie that binds, our love sweetheart
Was torn to shreds by you
But if you'll piece them up again
We'll start our life anew

  

You'll find the road, gets longer dear
When I'm not by your side
And I may shed some better tears
My love I cannot hideWe started out from Bern one sunny Augast morn
There was just the four of us against the Matterhorn
There was Albert the Australian and John the Irishman
Me and Bill from Britain, mad dogs in the sun

    Matterhorn, Matterhorn
    Men have tried and men have died to climb the Matterhorn
    That mighty Matterhorn

Two miles up we lost John and the rations fell bellow
Al and Bill were lying beneath an avalanche of snow
Now here I am all alone and I know I cannot stop

  

Now here I am a-dying upon the Matterhorn
Not a grave for me to lie in, not a thing to keep me warm
The Queen would surely knight me if I could get back down
But it's closer here to heaven that it is back to the ground'Twas on one cold winty night
And the wind blew across the wild moor
As poor Mary came wandering home with her child
She stopped at her own father's door

Oh, father, dear father, she cried
Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor

But the father wasdeaf to her cry
Not a sound of her voice did he hear
Though the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
And the winds blew across the wild moor

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When the came to the door the next morn
And found Mary dead, but the child still alive
Closely clasped in it's dead mother's arms

In anguish he tore his gray hair
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour
When he saw how that night she had perished and died
From the winds that blew across the wild moor

The old man with grief pined away
And the child to it's mother went soon
And no one they say has lived there to this day
And the cottage to ruin has gone

But the villagers point out the spot
Where the willows droop over the door
Saying there mary died once a gay village bride
From the winds that blew across the wild moorGoodbye Mary I must go said a lad now don't be slow
For it's duty calls me far across the sea
Take this autumn leaf of gold said the maid we'll never grow old
Always wear it near your heart and think of me

Meet me yonder down the lane when I come back home again
Neath the tree where this autumn leaf once grew
Kiss me Mary then we'll part said the lad with a broken heart
When the leave begin to fall I'll be with you

    I'll be there Mary dear, I'll be there
    When the fragrance of the roses fills the air
    Neath that oak tree grand and tall when the leaves begin to fall
    I'll be there, yes, I'll be ther, sweet Mary dear

See the lad with empty sleeve and his comrades taking leave
They're now home again, the transport has come back
If she loved you long ago she won't love you less I know
And one arm will do to h old her to you, Jack

It was autumn time again as he wandered down the lane
There beneath that oak he found a grave
There he knelt in silent prayer for the one he loved slept there
And the tears fell on the golden leaves she gaveOh I left her in the mountains in the golden summertime
I told her not to worry little darling pal of mine
I told her that I loved her and always would be true
When the moon comes o'er the mountain, I'll be waitin' there for you

    She's my darling she's my sweetheart, she's the one for me
    With a heart as pure as gold and in dreams her face I see
    Soon I'll be returning and the wedding bells will chime
    And I'll make her mine forever when it's maple sugar time

Jerry Tuckett will play the fiddle, folks will come from miles away
To the maple sugar hoedown, what a happy wedding day
I'll be a country king and I'll paint a pretty scene
I'll kiss her smiling ruby lips, she'll be my maple sugar QueenIn a  quiet country village stood a maple on the hill
Where I sat with my Geneva long ago
As the stars were shining brightly we could hear the whippoorwill
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill

We would sing love song together while the birds had gone to rest
We would listen to the murmur o'er the hill
Will you love me little darling as you did as you did those starry nights
As we sat beneath the maple on the hill

Don't forget me, little darling when they lay me down to die
Just one little wish, darling that I pray
As you linger there in sadness thinking, darlig, of the past
Lay your teardrops kiss the floweres on my grave

I will soon be with the angels on that bright and peaceful shore
Even now I hear them coming o'er the hill
Soon goodbye my little darling, it is time for us to part
I must leave you and that maple on the hillTonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill

Do you recall when we parted
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've walked all through the years, love
To give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you are living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shines bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hillI am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The state where I was borned and raised

For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I find
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now

It's fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train

You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave

It's fare you well to a native country
The places I have loved so well
For I have seen all kinds of trouble
In this cruel world, no tongue can tell

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shoreYou say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'cause you're making plans to leave

    You're making plans to forget me
    I'm making plans to miss you
    I'm getting ready to grieve
    I'm making plans to be lonesome
    'cause you're making plans to leave

The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the teardropps
'cause you're making plans to leaveMaking believe that you still love me
It's leaving me a-long and so blue
But I'll always dream still, I'll never own you
Making believe, it's all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you, making believe

Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours, I find, are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe, what else can I do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe, I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you, making believeCity girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace, go in a style

Late at night, a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hand as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leavin'
She is heased for the cheating side of the town

    You can't hide your lyin' eyes
    And your smile is a thin disguise
    I though by now you'd realize
    There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waitin'
With firery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipatik'
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whisper that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be comming back forever
She goes away and leaves him with a smile

  

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And staresout at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks abot a boy, she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My oh my, You sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how you knew life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

  

There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyesOne evening getting dark we first met out in the park
Sitting by the fountain all alone
Oh I lifted up my hat, and then began to chat
She said she'd love to see me at her home

    Such a star I've never seen she's as pretty as a queen
    She is like and angel from the Golden Halls
    If she'll only be my wife I'll live happy all my life
    With that agravating beauty Lulu Walls

If she were only mine I would build a hose so fine
Round it I'd have many fences tall
It would make me jealous free, that no one else but me
Could gaze upon that beauty Lulu Walls

  

One evening getting late, Oh I met her at the gate
Asked her if she'd wed me in the fall
Then she slowly turned away, and nothing would she say
That agravating beauty Lule WallsMy worried, troubled mind can't sleep
    This story I must tell
    The worst mistake I ever made
    Was loving you too well

I've held you close ten thousand times
And you promised you'd be mine
You broke my heart ten thousand ways
This'll be your last time

  

Another man took you from me
He stole your heart away
I've often prayed to God above
That you'd wander back some dayI'm lonesome tonight while the moon shines so bright
Thinking of you little dear
I'm here all alone in my cabin at home
I'm countin' the stars in the blue

    Love sick and sorrow is what you brought to me
    Oh why tell me why did you go
    You left me to wander in this old world all alone
    I'm countin' the stars in the blue

I dream every night as I lay in my cabin
Prayin to the one up above
To keep you for me and someday will return you
I'm prayin to God up above

  

I'm taking your picture and framing in gold
Reading love letters from you
I'm longing to see you in our little cabin home
I'm counting the stars in the blueAre you read this letter that write to you
Sweetheart, I hope you'll understand
That you're the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can

    Sweetheart, I beg you to come home tonight
    I'm so blue and alone
    I promise that I'll treat you right
    Love, oh love, oh please come home

That old wind is cold and slowly creeping around
And thefire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
Your baby's hungry, sick and coldTwo trees on the hillside of the mountain
Always looking' up toward the sky
Reminds me of my Papa and Mama
Who lived there eighty years before they died

    Now a bright moon is shining in the valley
    An old wagon leans against a stack of hay
    Two graves on a hillside by a cabin
    My Mom and Dad are resting there today

The burning of the greenwood on the fireplace
The fallen snow around the redweed tree
The branches of the laurel by the creek bed
And the ripplin' waters the little stream

  

Papa used to talk about the young days
When he and Mama first settled there
He spoke about the love of the monutains
That he and Mama shared together thereThat night we parted long ago
I vowed my love I'd never show
Sweetheart I find that I can't hide
My love beneath this foolish pride

    If I could hold you one more time
    And kiss thte lips that once were mine
    It would ease this aching hearrt of mine
    If you would say you love me one more time

Oh won't you take me back once more
Give me the love I'm longing for
It would ease this aching heart of mine
If you would say you love me one more timeLove me, darling just tonight
    Take your arms hold me tight
    Tommorrow you may hold another
    Love me, darling just tonight
	

	
Try to find true love in your heart
Tommorrow we may not have to part
But if you feel you must leave me
Love me, darling just tonight

  
 
You say tommorrow you are leavin'
I hope you know this way is wrong
I pray to God you won't leave me
Love me, darling just tonightI love on a street of sorrow
The blues keep knocking at my door
I leave each new born day for tomorrow
For love is a stranger to me for ever more

    I've changed my address, but the blues keep hanging round
    There's a new street number, but sorrow's all I've found
    I awaken from sweet dreams each night to find that you are gone
    And love is a stranger and a memory from now on

Will this ever end I keep on wondering
Will that stranger known as love give me a smile
Must I go through life alone pretending 
Or will love be a stranger until the end of timeThe music played so sweetly
While I held you close you close to me
The memory of your love
I can't erase
It was there, I kissed you gently
And you whispered tenderly
I love you and I'll treasure every phrase
The moon, looked down so lonesome
And a night bird, whistled low
It seemed, the stars enchanted
Then did fall
It seemd, a perfect picture
While the shadows round us fell
I fell in love
While they played, the love call waltzDarling I'm all alone, in our little mountain home
It's empty cold and loveless now inside
For your childesh love and vows, lasted only one short year
Then you went away to be another's bride

    You will never know the pain
    That I left the day you left
    Should you ever love again
    Let me whish you love and wealth

While the same old whippoorwill breaks the silence on the hill
I stand and gaze upon the faded wall
Where your picture used to hang in a little golden frame
And a vision of your smile I still recall

  

Thouth they say we live and learn from our sorrowws we must turn
And be able to forgetr sad memories
Let me wish you love and wealth may you take good care of yourself
But my broken heart will last eternallyLost all my money but a two-dollar bill
    Two-sollar bill, boys, two-dollar bill
    Lost all my money but a two-dollar bill
    I'm on my long journey home

Black smoke's a-rising and it surely is atrain
Surely is a train, boys, surely is a train
Black smoke's a-rising and it surely is a train
I'm on my long journey home

  

Dark and it's raining and I've got to go home
Got to go home, boys, got to go home
Dark and it's raining and I've got to go home
I'm on my long journey homeWe went out one evening my darling and I
She seemed so different and I wondered why
We stopped at a tavern and there I could see
That she loved another one better than me

    While they dancing and I sat alone
    I knew I had lost her the one I loved
    Lost to a stranger I never had seen
    The waltz they were playing had ended my dream

The bande was playing an old fashioned waltz
The dance floor was crowded and I wasn't long
Then up stepped a stranger I never had seen
He asked my darling will you dance with meDown life's highway alone I taught
I always put my trust in God
But you'll find out
That your silver and gold won't pay
The price to protect your soul

    Oh, I want the Lord to protect my soul
    To lead me on to the heaven shore
    My life down here will soon be oer
    If you want the Lord to protect your soul

There's many a church down life's highway
Where people sing, rejoice and praise
Why don't you stop at once and join the folk
And ask the Lord to protect your soul

  

When this old world is soomed with sin
You'll cry oh Lord please let me in
But then it'll be too late to make your goal
And ask the Lord to protect your soulI won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time

I'm on my long journey homeLong gone is how I'm leaving
    Long gone, why do you cry
    This is what you wanted baby
    So I'm gone, long gone

I have tried to make you happy
Still you say I've done you wrong
Oh I'm giving up my darling
So I'm gone, long gone

  

Please don't try to overtake me
What I ride will be too fast
This is it, we're through forever
I'm gone, I'm free at last

  

Please don't shed no tears at parting
For your tears will not atone
After all the pain you cause me
I'm gone, long gone

  

Now if I find this to be true, dear
I want you to please understand
When I return don't say you're sorry
Just keep on loving another manTen years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the Town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

    She walks these hills in a long black veil
    She vesits my grave while the night winds wail
    Nobody knows, nobody sees
    Nobody knows but me

The judge said Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die
I spole not a word thought it meant my life
Tor I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

  

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometime at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bonesWhen we were young we loved each other
more than anyone will know
But today you found a new love
And you said I had to go

    Oh the road is rough and rocky
    Since the day I last saw you
    Another's won your heart forever
    And I'm lonesome without you

On down this lonely road I wandered
With nothing left for me to do
Wondering if I'll ever see you
And share the love that we once knew

  

My hope is now that you'll be happy
With the new love that we once knew
But if you ever cange your mind dear
Remember me I'll be aroundI hear the wind a-blowing through the lonesome pine
    And I know my love is gone too
    I hear the wind a-blowing through the lonesome pine
    That's why I'm blue love, so blue

She's gone so far away thats why I'm griving
She's left me here alone among the trees
And all that I have left is just a memory
And it always haunts me with a breeze

  

I'll leave the day they try to find my darling
I don't know where on earth she can be
I know that I can't ever live without her
For each night in dreams her face I seeThere's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you'll pay
Is a heart full of tears

    Going down to lonesome town
    Where the broken hearts stay
    Going down to lonesome town
    To cry my troubles away

	
    In the town of broken dreams
    The streets are filled with regret
    Maybe down in lonesome town
    I can learn to forget

   
 
Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forgetI'm going down this road feeling bad
    I'm going down this road feeling bad
    I'm going down this road feeling bad, lord, lord
    And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way
Down in the jailhouse on my knees
Down in the jailhouse on my knees
Down in the jailhouse on my knees,Great God
And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way

  

They feed me on corn bread and beens
They feed me on corn bread and beens
They feed me on corn bread and beens, O lord
And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way

  

I ain't got no shoes on my feet
I ain't got no shoes on my feet
I ain't got no shoes on my feet, Lord God
And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way

  

It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot
It takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my foot, Great God
And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way

  

I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes, O lord
And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-way

  

I'm goin' if I never get back
I'm goin' if I never get back
I'm goin' if I never get back, LOrd God
And I ain't a-gonna be treated this a-wayLook down, look down that lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry
The best of friends must part someday
And why not you and I

I wish to God that I had died
Had died fore I was born
Before I seen your smiling face
And heard your lying tongueI sit here alone, oh the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows, the water rolls high
I hear a voice call out there in the darkness
I sit here alone too lonesome to cry

    Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
    I sit on the ahore to weep and cry
    The woman I love she left me this morning
    With no one to love or kiss me good night

We met there one night on the banks of the river
We stood holding hands and making our vows
Swore we'd never part we'd be happy forever
But a new love she's found she'd gone from me nowI'm lonesome pine on the mountain
All alone I find no one by my side
Oh I wish I had me a dogwood tree
That would bloom beside me for company

    I'm lonesome so lonesome I'll never know why
    I must stand all alone till the day that die
    I'll never get over this sorrow of mine
    This evergreen sorrow from the lonesome pine

In the summertime when the wind blows free
There's a mournful song in the heart of me
It's the saddest song that you'll ever hear
For the lonesome pine will you shed a tear

  

In the wintertime when the snow falls down
And my branches drop till they touch the ground
You can hear me groan withthe load I bear
For its mine all alone no one seems to careI set here in shame while the records are playing
The bules hang around me no need to go home
I keep on a drinking and wandering about her
That lonesome old song reminds me she's gone

    That lonesome old song keep on a playing
    And telling a story that makes me so blue
    How the girl that I love has gone on and left me
    That lonesome old song reminds me of you

I know I'm a fool to still care about her
She's been unfaithful, unkind and untrue
But all that she's done right now don't matter
That lonesome old song reminds me we're thru

  

I know some day I'll get over losing
She only girl I could ever call mine
Since she's gone away, my life ain't worth living
For a lonesome old song and a bottle of wineIt's cold outside, the wind is blowing
    And the snow is falling down
    Now I'm so lonesome here without you
    While you're somewhere running around

You done me wrong my little darling
Leaving me here this way
Some day I know I'll find you
When I do, I'll make you pay

  

Some times at night I dream about you
Wondering why you went away
You're out there some where with another
And I'm gonna find you some dayIt's lonesome feeling when you're traveling
    Down a lonesome road, down a lonesome road
    Nobody cares a thing about you
    It's a heavy road, it's heavy road

I wish that I was in Kentucky
With poppa and mama dear
but mama's gone now and is poppa
And Kentucky that's long way from here

  

I found the love since I've married
Her love was true as she told me so
I gave a ring with all my money
But she run off to where I never knowThey carried my girl to the burying ground
They carried my girl to the burying ground
They carried my girl to the burying ground
I watched her as they laid her down

    Today has been a lonesome day
    Today has been a lonesome day
    Today has been a lonesome day
    And tommorrow gonna be the same old way

Go big my grave with a silver spade
Go big my grave with a silver spade
Go big my grave with a silver spade
And mark the plce where I'll be laid

  *Refrain

Dig you ever here a church bell toll
Dig you ever here a church bell toll
Dig you ever here a church bell toll
You'll know by that I'm dead and gone

  *RefrainI got the lonesome blues tonight
Won't you stay here dear friend that's what I need
Someone to hold me tight well it's all right
I got the lonesome blues tonight

I got the homely blues tonight
May be got some time to lend I'll try to be
The one you miss tonight make you feel all right
I got the homely blues tonight

I got the cold, cold blues tonight
Won't you try to understand if I can be
With someone else tonight when you dim the light
I got the cold, cold blues tonightTell me why
I've got no money
Seems I'm always flat broke
Spent my life
Chasing gold mines
Worked my fingers to the bone
I'm so tired of hanging round
Get me out of this old town
Back so far and up so high
I won't ever touch the ground

    It's goodbye lonesome angel
    Gonna fly never coming down
    The creek ran dry lonesome angel
    You can look for me
    Out where the sun goes down

Big ole-moon
I know you're up there
But I just can't see you tonight
Those dark black clouds
Are right behind me
I think they're looking for a fight
I'm a fool to have stayed this long
Point me out and I'll be gone
Back so far and up so high
Just a singing this sweet songOh, I'm getting old and feeble and I can't work on more
The children no more gather around my door
And ol' massa and ol' missus, they are sleeping side by side
Near the little ol' log cabin in the lane

Oh, the chimney's falling down and the roof's all caved in
Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh, the paths have all growed up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed thier course another day

Oh, I ain't got long to stay here, what little time I got
I want to rest content while I remain
Till death shall call this dog and me to find a better home
And that little old log cabin in the laneYou told me that you loved me and always would be mine
But now you've gone and left me with troubles on my mind
Everybody told me that our love wouldn't last
I can't live for the future so I'm living in the past

Tear drops, heartaches, I knew that our love wouldn't last
Lonely, worried darling, I'm living in the past
Someday I know your new love is gonna let you down
But I'll be waiting for you, I'll still be around
Now you're free and happy and living much too fast
While I'm blue and lonely and living in the pastThey tell me you're going away
What makes you want to leave
You gave me your love
You gave me your vow
And you're leaving me here to grieve

    Live and let live, don't break my heart
    Don't leave me here to cry
    I never could live if we should part
    Tell me you don't mean good-bye

Stayed awake last night and I walked the floor
What makes you treat me so
Live and let live, don't break my heart
I don't want to live if you go

  

You're the one who made me love you so
You're the one who's making my cry
You're the one who'd break me heart if you go
Tell me you don't mean good-bye

  *RefrainWhere the Mississippi flowing on the sunny southern shores
And the steamboat come a-puffing round the bend
There's a little old log cabin with a grape vine o're the door
And a little white washed chimney at the end

    Oh, I'm going back, yes, going back to the place I love so well
    To the folks who'll want me all their own again
    In the little old log cabin with the grape vine o're the door
    And a little white washed chimney at the end

Oh, I went away up North where they told me I would find
Money hanging around like apples on a tree
But it was as my sweetheart told me there was nothing of the kind
And the weather was so cold I thought I'd freeze

  

I can see the smoke a-rising from the little chimney top
As it welcomes me and greets me on the breeze
Then I will start a-running and I know I'll never stop
Till I've landed in that cabin on my kneesThere's a little white church in the valley
That stands in my memory each day
And it seems I can hear the bells now ringing
Though I am many miles away
And many times in church on Sunday morning
That whole countryside would gather there
They would all kneel down by the altar
As they lifted up their voice in prayer

    Oh, the church in the valley
    Oh, that little white church
    Is the place I love so well
    Now I'm sad and lonely, yes, I'm sad and lonely
    For that little white church in the dell

They would sing the old song Rock of Ages
Oh Christ, let me hide myself in thee
And I know some of them are now waiting
Just o'er the dark and stormy sea
I know that trouble all are ended
And happy forever they will be
They are waiting and watching up yonder
For the coming home of you and meThere's s little rosewood cakes
Sitting on a marble stand
There's a package of love letters
Written by my true love's hand

Will you go and get them sister
And read them o'er tonight
For I woke and tried, but could not
For the tears would blind my sight

Please go trace the lines so slowly
Then I'll not miss even one
For the precious hand that wrote this
Its last work for me is done

You have got them now, dear sister
Come sit down upon my bed
And press gently to your bosom
This poor throbbing, aching head

Tell him that I never blamed him
Not an unkind word was said (spoke)
Tell, oh tell him, sister, tell him
That my heart in coldness broke

Tell him that I never blamed him
Though to me he proved untrue
Tell him that'll never forget him
Till I bid this world adieu

When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my little bed is ready
In the cold and silent ground

Place his letters and his locket
Close together o'er my heart
Let the little ring he gave me
From my finger never part

You have finished now, dear sister
If you read them o'er again
While I listen to you read them
I will lose all sense of pain

While I listen to you read them
I will gently fall asleep
For it's sweet to wake with Jesus
Oh, dear sister, do not weepI am looking rather seedy now
While hohding down my claim
And the mice play shyly round me as I nestle down to rest
In the little old sod shanty on my claim

    The hinges are of leaher and the windows have no glass
    While the board roof letsthe howling bizzard in
    And I hear the hungry coyote as he slinks up through the grass
    Round the little old sod shanty on my claim

Yet, I rather like the novelty of living in this way
Though my bill of fare is always rather tame
But I'm happy as a clam on the land of Uncle Sam
In the little old sod shanty on my claim

  

But when I left my Easten home, a bachelor so gay
To try and win my way to wealth and fame
I little thought I'd come down to burning twisted hay
In the little old sod shanty on my claim

  

My clothes are plastered o'er with dough I'm looking like a fright
And everything is scattered round the room
But I wouldn't give the freedom that I have out in the West
For the table of the Eastern man's old home

  

Still, I wish that some kind-hearted girl would pity on me take
And relieve me from the mess that I am in
The angel, how I'd bless her if this her home she'd make
In the little old sod shanty on my claim

  

And if fate should bless us with now and then an heir
To cheer our hearts with honest pride of fame
Oh, then we'd be contented for the toil that we had spent
In the little old sod shanty on our claim

  

When time enough had lapsed and all those little brats
To noble man and womanhood had grown
It wouldn't seem half so lonely as round us we should look
And we'd see the old sod shanty on our claimYonder standsLIttle Maggie
With her dream glass in her hand
She's drinkin' away her troubles, oh lord
And foolin' another man

Marching down to the station
Cash in my hand
Going away for to leave you
Going to some far-off land

Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty girls were made for lovin'
Little Maggie were made to be mine

How can I ever stand it
Just to see two blue eyes
Shining like the diamonds
The diamonds in the skyThere's a house in Baltimore
Sixteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was full of chicken pie

    Oh Liza, poor girl
    Oh Liza Jane
    Oh Liza, poor girl
    She died on the train

I went up on the mountain
To give my horn a blow
And every girl in the countryside
Said yonder comes my beau

  

When I was a little boy
I liked to go in swimming
Now I am a bigger boy
I like to go with women

  

I wish I had a candy box
To put my sweetheart in
I'd take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again

  

One day I set a-courting
A girl as dear as life
When a woman ahe said to me
Mr.Jones, how is your wifeWhat will the birds do, Mother, in the spring
Will they gather crumbs around my door
Will they fly from the trees, tap upon my window
And ask why Joe wanders out no more

And what will the kitten do, Mother, all alone
Will he stop from his prowling for a day
Will he lay on the rug by the side of my bed
As he did before I went away

And what will Thomas the old gardner say
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
First fairest bloom from the tree

I could see the teadrops forming in his honest old eyes
He said it was the wind that brought them there
As he gazed on my cheeks arowing paler each day
His hands trembling o'er my hair

Keep tige, Mother, my poor little dog
I know he will mourn for me too
Keep him though old and useless he grows
Sleeping the whole summer through

Show him my coat, Mother, so he won't forget
His master who then will be dead
Speak to him often and kindly of Joe
And pat him on his brown shaggy head

And you dearest, Mother, may miss me for a while
But in heaven no larger I'll grow
And any kind angel well know at the gate
When you ask for your darling little JoeI am always dreaming of my little home
Back among the hills of Tennessee
I am always yearning, longing to return
To the place that means the world to me
Just a little shack roof all turning black
Still it's a place there to me
Song birds always shinging round the kitchen door
Of my little home in Tennessee

I can see my mother standing by the gate
As I drove the old horse up the lane
She would never scold me when I came home late
How I wish that I had never cause her pain
Just a tender smile beaming all the while
No one could be half so kind to me
Now she's gone to Heaven and she'll never teturn
To my little home in Tennessee

I can still remember many years ago
When my sweetheart wandered by my side
Down among the mountains where wild flowers grow
There she promised she would be my bride
Then another man won her heart and hand
She always meant the world to me
I was broken hearted and I went away
From my little home in TennesseeCome little girl let's go get married
My love is so great, how can you slight me
I'll work for you both late and early
And at our wedding my little wife you'll be

Oh Willie dear, let's both consider
We're both too young to be married now
When we're married, we're bound together
Let's stay single just one more year

He went to the where she was dancing
A jealous thought came to his mind
I'll kill that girl, my own true lover
Fore I let another man beat my time

He went to the bar and he to him
Said Willie dear, what you want with me
Come and drink wine with the one that loves you
More than anyone else you know, said he

While they were at the bar a-drinking
That same old thopught came to his mind
He killed that girl, his own true lover
He gave her poison in a glass of wine

She laid her head over on his shoulder
Said Willie dear, please take me home
That glass of wine that I've been drinking
Has gone to my head and done me wrong

He laid his head over on the pillow
Let me read you the Lord, let me tell you one line
Molly dear, I'm sorry to tell you
We both drank poison in a glass of wine

They fold their arms around each other
They cast their eyes unto the sky
Oh God, oh God, ain't this a pity 
That the both true lovers are bound to dieOh, a long long time ago
When I left my home you know
Down in the hills of Tennessee
Lived the sweetheart little girl
That in the hills of Tennessee

    Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
    I know she's waiting there for me
    Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
    With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, she begged me not to go
You'll sorry dear I know
For the way that you are treatin' me
So I'll ramble all around
But there's nothing sold be found
That'd take the place of her in Tennessee

  

Oh, someday I'll wander back
To that little mountain shack
Little girl is waiting there for me
I'll see her smilin' face
Waitin' for me atthe gate
Little girl of mine in TennesseeIn the night, while you lay sleeping
Dreaming of your amber skies
Was a poor boy broken hearted
Listning to the winds that sigh

    My little darling, oh how, I love you
    How I love you, none can tell
    In your heart you love another
    Little darling, pal of mine

Many a day, with you I've rambled
Happiest hours, with you I've spent
For I had your heart forever
But I find it's only lent

  

There is just three things I wish for
That's my casket, shroud and grave
When I'm dead, don't weep for me
Just like those lips that you betrayed'Twas on a little covered bridge
We met and laughed together dear
Holding hands as lovers do
On a day so bright and clear
You said that you'd be true to me
We kissed upon the ridge
But you have found another love darling
On that little covered bridge

Found another love darling
On that little covered bridge

You broke my heart and went away
Never more to have you near
And when I die and leave this world
Would you laugh or shed a tear
And when you tell him you'll be true
And kiss him on the ridge
Will you try to think of me darling
On that little covered bridge

Try to think of me darling
On that little covered bridgeLittle country preacher with his head bowed down in prayer
I know that he's in conference with our Load, away up there
He's not hightoned with his speech just plain like you and me
He reminds me fo the prophets and the man of Calilee

He started out when just a lad to preach the gospel way
And when the path got hard to trod with mothe he would stay
The momey did not bother him for Christ he took his stand
His payday will be paid to him  at the gates of Glory Land

The little church he preaches at each Sunday for our aske
If you pass it by and don't go in you've made a big mistake
His good old fashioned voice pleads stranger enter in
God's pleading through good men to save us from our sinsI'm long way from old Dixie
Near my old Kentucky home
And my father and mother are both dead
Got no place to call my home
OH, I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you another man's woman
When you promised to be mine

    Little birdie, little birdie
    Come and sing me your song
    Got a short time to stay here
    And a long time to be gone

Little birdie, little birdie
What makes you act so queer
You've got no cause to worry
And don't need no clothes to wear
Married woman married woman
Come and see what you have done
You have caused me to love you
Now your husband is dead and gone

  

Oh I'd rather be a sailor
Way out there upon the sea
Than to be a married man
With a baby on my knee
For a married man sees trouble
While a single man sees none
And I'd rather be a single man
And have all my funHug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
For I'm cold and tired dear mother
And I feel so stranger tonight

All at once a window opened
Upon one so bright and fair
And I knew it must be Jesus
When he said come near my child

Come up here little Bessie
Come up here and live with me
Where little children never suffer
In the long eternity

Then I thought of all you told me
Of that bright and happy land
I was going when you called me
When you came and kissed my hand

I felt so sorry when you called me
And from this world I soon must go
Go to sleep and never suffer
Then dear mother don't be crying so

Hug me closer closer mother
Put your arms around me tight
Oh, how much I love you, mother
And I feel so strange tonight

And the mother pressed her darling
Closer to her own dear burning breast
To the heart so near broken
Lay the child so near at rest

At the solemn hour of midnight
In the dark and lonesome deep
Lying on her mother's bosom
Little Bessie fell asleep

Far up yonder at the portais
That are shining very fair
Little Bessie now is tended
By her Savior's loving careOne night as the stars were all shining
Little Benny knelt down by his bed
He asked the dear Lord to forgive him
For all the bad words he had said

    Please papa don't whip little Benny
    Please papa don't whip little Ben
    He's little and wants you to love him
    Please papa don't whip little Ben

You remember how moma loved Benny
How she kissed him the morning ahe died
She told him to love and obey you
And I know little Benny has tried

  

Oh what if dear moma in Heaven
Should be looking way down from the sky
And see you whip little Benny
I know it would make moma cry

  

Those very bad words that he said
He learned from some old wicked men
He's little and didn't know better
Please papa don't whip little BenI'm looking out the window at the rain
The night is driving me crazy
It's just as cold inside
All the warms is gone without my baby
And in my mind something stirs
And my lips start crying out your name
While I'm a-sitting here and wondering where you are
And listening to the rain

The beating on the window can't compare with the beating
That I'm taking
The window's gone hold, but look at me
I'm already breaking
Memories tugging at my heart
And it's gonna crack beneath the strain
While I'm sitting here wondering where you are
And listening the rain

My mind has got you pictured
In the arms and in the heart of some new love
I've tried to black it out
But all my mind can see is him and you, love
Knowing that it might be true
That's the thing that's causing all the pain
While I'm sitting here wondering where you are
And listening to the rainI'm dreaming now of Hallie, sweet Hallie, sweet Hallie
I'm dreaming now of Hallie, for the thought of her is one that never dies
She's sleeping in the valley, the valley, the valley
She's sleeping in the valley, and the mockingbird shinging where she lies

    Listen to the mockingbird, listen to the mockingbird
    The mockingbird is singing o'er her grave
    Listen to the mockingbird, listen to the mockingbird
    Still singing where the weeping willows wave

Ah well I yet can remember, I remember, I remember
Ah well I yet can remember, when we gathered in the cotton side by side
'Twas in the mild mid-September, in September, in September
'Twas in the mild mid-September, and the mockingbird was singing far and wide

  

When charms of spring are awaken, are awaken, are awaken
When charms of spring are awaken and the mockingbird is singing on the bough
I feel like one so forsaken, so forsaken, so forsaken
I feel like one so forsaken, since my Hallie is no longer with me nowIt's not that love is dead and gone
Or that you didn't try
That weight so heavy on my mind
It's the shought that you might mean it
When you call me on the phone
Just to tell me that you want me one more time

    I won't be standing at your door
    I stood there once before
    I've known your hello and your good-bye
    So why am I shaking like a child in the rain
    When you tell me that you want me one more time
    When you tell me that you want me one more time

Don't talk about the midnights
That come down like a stone
Can't you see that I already know
And after all the morning sun
Will burn away the dark
But even if you're there I'll be around

  

There's part of me that laughs
There's part of me that cries
There's part of me that can't make up it's mind
But living would be easier
If you never call at all
To tell me that you want me one more timeLife is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer so brave
We must make this run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the fills the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

    Oh, blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us
    Til we reach that blissful shore
    Where the angels wait to join us
    In God's grace forever more

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train will glide
There you'll meet the superintendent
God the Father, God the Son
With a hearty, joyous greeting
Weary pilgrim, welcome homeI was stnding by my window yesterday morning
Without a thought of worry or of care
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway
With such a jolly self and happy air

We rang the bell and whistled while he waited
Then he said good morning to you Jack
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me
As he handed me a letter edged in black

With trembling hands I took the letter from him
Opened it and this is what it said
Come home my boy your poor old father wants you
Come home my boy your dear old mother's dead

The last words that your mother ever uttered
Was tell my boy I want him to come back
My eyes are blurred my poor old heart is breaking
While I'm writing you this letter edged in blackLet's say goodbye like we said in a friendly kind of way
There's something wrong, your love is gone, I've no reason now to stay
We live and love, we meet and part, then broken hearts must pay
Let's say goodbye like we said hello, in a friendly kind of way

Your love sweetheart I won't forget you're always on my mind
You're all the happiness I knew, so thoughtful sweet and kind
For old times sake I'm asking you to think of me someday
Let's say goodbye like we said hello, in a friendly kind of way

I wish you happiness sweetheart in everything you do
May good luck always come your way and every dream come true
I'll remember you and the love we knew, the love of yesterday
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way

If I should meet some other dear and learn to love them too
I hope and pray somehow sweetheart they'll make me think of you
A tender smile an old love song a heart so light and gay
Let's say goodbye like we said hello, in a friendly kind of wayEach night I dream of you sweet heart
I can't see why we had to part
But there's no reason now to stay
For I was only in your way

    Oh how I long to see your face
    Tho' there's someone in my place
    Or just to hear your voice again
    Darling why not part the best of friends

I played the game of love and lost
My broken heart has paid the cost
And now that I am free to go
Somehow  sweet heart I miss you so

  

You say that you are happy now
I'll try to forget the past some how
But if your new love turns you down
Remember me, I'm still aroundLet's live for tonight dear and try to be gal
Tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love have it's way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts

Let's cast all our worries and heartaches saide
Forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone

Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend
That we will never be alone
No matter what happens this night will be ours
What tomorrow holds, nobody ever knows

Let's live for tonight dear and try to be gay
Tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear, let love have it's way
For tomorrow we could have two broken heartsCome on boys let's go to the fair
See the funny sights and the cool night air
Grasshopper kissing the old black crow
Road hog red do the dose do

    More funny things than you ever did see
    Ringtail cooms, monkeys in the trees
    Pussy cat combing the tomcat's hair
    Come on boys let's go to the fair

Had a banjo picking rooster the cockiest of 'em all
Strutted on the stage in his bib overalls
Close behind was old fiddling bear
Bluegrass music by a rooster and a bear

  

Old mother goose wore fancy clothes
High heeled slippers and fancy clothes
An old bare possum in his underwear
Killed himself a laughing at the county fairJack and May, sweethearts were they
They were engaged to be wed
Many a promise he made her
Many a love word he said
As most lovers do, they quarreled one night
She bid him not come any more
She gave him his hat, Jack started away
But he lingered to say at the door

    'Tis up these broken cords, and let us lovers again
    Darling you know I love you, to part would give me pain
    Let us forget the past and make up my pet
    Make up and be lovers again

Years rolled by, neither was wed
All of Jack's pleading was vain
One quiet evening poor Jack was found dead
All through life in dismay
Two lives have been wrecked, for she loved oh, too later
She goes to his grave every day 
She can't tell youy why, but it seems to her cry
The wind seems to whisper and sayToday I feel so sad and wearly
I want a love that can not be
All I need to make me happy
Let those brown eyes smile at me

    Let those brown eyes smile at me dear
    That's what I wish with all my soul
    Let those brown eyes smile at me dear
    Turn my blue moon back to gold

Now we've been sweethearts so long darling
And now you've growing tired of me
The last time that we were together
Those brown eyes didn't smile at meLay your head on my shoulder
    Rub your little hand in mine
    We'll walk down lover's lane together
    Let me love you one more time

Tomorrow you'll be with another
Things just didn't turn out right
But to my grave I'll carry your memory
A memory of your love tonight

  

Tomorrow you'll be with another
Things just didn't turn out right
But to my grave I'll carry your memory
A memory of your love tonightLet me fall, let me fall, let me fall
    Little girl let me fall
    Oh me, oh my let me fall
    Little girl let me fall

Little girl locked in jail
Won't you please get someone to go my bail
Oh me, oh my let me fall
Little girl let me fall

  

Guess I knew five years ago
When you called me
A drunken so and so
Oh me, oh my let me fall
Little girl let me fall

  

I don't care what you say
I'm going to drink
My corn liquor anyway
Oh me, oh my let me fall
Little girl let me fallMany times I've thought about you
Many times I've wondered why
That you'd ever go and leave me
And this heart you taught to cry

    Darling wait until I see you
    Since you say it is the end
    Though I know that you don't love me
    Won't you let me be your friend

As I lay upon my pillow
Thinking of you in my dreams
Are you happy with another
I'm so lonesome here it seems

  

Do you ever think about me
Will you love again someday
Will you ever think my darling
Of this heart you stole awayLet me be a little kinder, let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me, let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and little less of me

Let me be a little braver when temptations let me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with a brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbors and a little less of me

Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little better those that I am striving for
Let me be a little meeker to a brother that is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of meLeona, Leona it's over and thru
    You tell him Leona about me and you
    You tell him you're married, with a baby or two
    You tell him Leona, you tell him you're thru

You left as I pleaded and walked out the door
To meet him to greet him to shame me once more
I knew where to find you just follow the signs
Dancing and dining, cockails and wine

   

The sidewalk was crowded in front of the bar
I heard the sirens the black police car
Two bodies lay crumbled, a woman, a man
His wife stood there by you a gun in her hand


Leona, Leona it's over and thru
The baby is crying and calling for you
For me there's no difference I've known for so long
That some day you'd leave me and now you are goneWhat a fellowship, what a joy divine
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine
Leaning on the everlasting arms

    Leaning, leaning
    Safe and secure from all alarms
    Leaning, leaning
    Leaning on the everlasting arms

O how sweet to walk in the pilgrim way
Leaning on the everlasting arms
O how bright the path grows from day to day
Leaning on the everlasting arms

  

What have I to dread, what have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near
Leaning on the everlasting armsThe leaf of love is slowly falling
    LIke winter storms with rain and snow
    You broke a heart in one short moment
    The leaf of love is falling low

How could you go and leave me lonely
I have no one to call my own
The tree that bore my love for you dear
Has shed its leaves my love is gone

  

Stormy roads I'm traveling on now
Where I'll end, God only knows
A beaten rock along the river
It's quiet and peaceful where it flowsI was late last night when Willie came home
Heard him a-rapping on the door
Slipping and a-sliding with his new shoes on
Willie don't you rap no more

    Oh me, oh my
    What's gonna become of me
    I's down town just fooling around
    No one to stand by me

One old shirt is about all I've got
And a dollar is all I crave
Brought nothing with me into this world
Gonna take nothing to my grave

  

Whish I was down in old Baltimoe
Sitting in an easy chair
One arm around my old guitar
And the other around my dear

  

Whish I had a needle and thread 
As fine as I could sew 
Sew all the good looking girls to my back
And down the road I'd goIt's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In a wink of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand

    Are you going away with no words of farewell
    Can there be not a trace left behind
    I could have loved you better
    I didn't mean to be unkind
    You know that was the last thing on my mind

You got reason aplenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

  

As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Each song in my breast dies of abornin'
Without you, without you

  
Darling, that was the last thing on my mindOh the wind blows cold
    On the trail of the buffalo
    Oh the wind blows cold
    In the land of the Navajo
    In the land of the Navajo

A hundred miles from nowhere out on the desert sand
One Eyed Jack the trader hold some turquoise in his hand
By his side sat Running Elk his longtime Indian freind
He vowed that he would stay by Jack until the bitter end
Jack had gambled everything he owned to leave this wondering life
He might have had a happy home and a tender loving wife
But his hunger was for trading trapper's furs for turquoise stones
Anythihg that the Indians had Jack wanted for his own

  

Said Jack to Running Elk I'll gamble all my precious stones
Before I leave my body here among these bleaching bones
Though now my time is drawing near and I'm filled with dark regrets
My spirit longs to journey as the sun begins to set
We raped and killed we stole your land
We rule with guns and knives add whiskey to your waters
While we stole away your wives said Running Elk, what's done is done
You white men rule this land so lay the cards face up
And play your dice, broken hearted man

 

When your dealing cards with death the joker's wild, the ace is high
Jack bet the Mississippi River running Elk raised him the sky
Jack saw him with the sun and room and upped him with the stars
Running Elk bet the Rocky Mountains Jupiter and Mars
The sun was sinking in the west when Jack draw the ace of spades
Running Elk just rolled his eyes he smiled and passed away
Jack picked up his truquoise stones and cast them to the sky
He stared into the setting sun aAnd made the mourful cryI met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every Sunday evening
Out in her home I'd dwell

We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
Oh, Willile, Dear, don't kill me here
I'm unprepared to die

She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curis
And dragged her round and round
Throwing her into the river
That flows through Knoxville TownI'm knockin' on your door again my darlin'
I'm knockin' on your door please answer me
Cause I've tried to make you realize my darlin'
That no one slse was ever meant for me
Well, I remember dear you said you'd always love me
And you promised me your happyness so true
But now you gone away, dear, with another
And I wonder if you feel the way I do

    I'm knockin' on your door again my darlin'
    I'm knockin' on your door please answer me
    Cause I've tried to make you realize my darlin'
    That no one else was ever meant for me

I'm knockin' on your door again my darlin'
I'm knockin' on your door please answer me
I never read the letter that you wrote my little darlin'
I'm sailing far across the deep blue sea
I'm knockin' on your door again my darlin'
To return the letters that you wrote to me
I'm knockin' on your door again my darlin'
This time honey, I'm sure things gonna be

  

So good-bye dear, I know you'll soon forget me
And I hope that you find happoness so true
But whenever you make love, sweetheart, remember
There will never always be the same for youKiss me once again then if I complain
    Tell me that you love me and kiss me once again

A kiss is something we have shared, that never will grow old
A kiss from you can thrill my heart and make my blood cold
For when I'm with the one I love, my heart beats wild within
When I feel your warm lips close to mine, just kiss me once again

  

Your kiss melted my heart of stone and made me think I'd win
Wiped all suspicion from my mind and made me love again
From now until eternity your heart I know I'll win
When stars strat shining in your eyes, just kiss me onece againAs I went down to the huckleberry picnic
Dinner all over the ground
Skeppers in the meat was nine foot deep
And the green flies walking all around
The biscuits in the oven was a-baking
Beefsteak frying in the pan
Petty gal sitting in the parlour
Lord God A'mighty, what a hand I stand

    Whoa there, mule, I tell you
    Miss Liza, you keep cool
    I ain't got time to kiss you now
    I'm busy with this mule

My uncle had an old mule
His name was Simon Slick
Bove anything I ever did see
Was how that mule could kick
Went to feed that mule one morning
And he met me at the door with a smile
He backed one ear and he winked one eye
And he kicked me half a mileWe were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon

As I sit alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In the beautiful Kentucky waltzThere's a dark and a trouble side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though you meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side may also find you

    Keep on the sunny side
    Always on the sunny side
    Keep on the sunny side of life
    It will help us every day
    It will brighten all the way
    If we keep on the sunny side of life

Oh, the storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
Clouds and storms will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

  

Let us green with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior away
Who keepeth every one in his careIf you should wander back this way when you are lonely too
Don't look for me for I will be long gone
I told you once before you left that I was through with you
You can't expect a man to linger on

    You are old enough to know that a man's love will not go
    When you take up with some one who you think's a little more fun
    If you don't find a welcome mat a-lying in your way
    Just keep on going is all that I can say

I got your letter yesterday you wanted to come home
But I've been happy since you've been away
I told you once before you left that I was through with you
So keep on going is all that I can sayI like country music I see lost of people use it
Just to help to soothe a hurtin deep inside their soul
It don't hard to understand it I know people who clemand it
That blew ribbon  brand can please  'em young and old

But that funky country sound puts a different massage down
But it don't  have to say a thing at all
I just know that when I hear it nothing else come ever near it
It's in my blood it's never gonna fall

Keep on funkin' up that country music children
Grow it in the streets and hollers by the pound
Red-neck nark or junky all like it funky
Can't nobody put this music downI'm going downtown, gonna get a sack of flour
Gonna cook it every hour, keep my skillet good and greasy
All the time, time, time
Keep my skillet good and greasy all the time

Well if you say so, I'll never work no more
I'll lay around your shanty
All the time, time, time
Lay around your shanty all the time

Well I'm goin' downtown gonna get me a jug of brandy
Gonna give it all to Nancy, keep her good and drunk and goozy
All the time, time, time
Good and drunk and goozy all the timeOh Katy dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we'll run away

Oh willie dear I cannot ask her
She's in her room up taking a rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the man that I love best

Oh Katy dear go sak your brother
If you can be a bride of mine
If he says yes come back and tell me
If he says no we'll run away

Oh Willie dear I cannot ask him
For he's there to up taking a rest
And by his side that silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Then he picked up that silver dagger
And stove it through his weary heart
Saying goodbye Katy, goodbye darling
At last the time has come to part

Then she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lilly white breast
Saying goodbye Willie, goodbye mother
I'll die with the one that I love bestWell now, who does not know Katy Cline
She lives at the foot of the hill
By the shady nook of some old babbling brook
That runs by her dear old father's mill
 
    Tell me that you love me Katy Cline
    Tell me that your love's as true as mine
    Tell me that you love your own turtle dove
    Tell me that you love me Katy Cline

It's way from my little cabin door
Oh it's way from my little cabin home
There's no one to weep and there's no one to mourn
And there's no one to see Katy Cline

  

If I was a little bird
I'd never build my nest on the ground
I'd build my nest in some high yonder tree
Where them wild boys couldn't tear it downCome on down the mountain, Katy Daley
    Come on down the mountain, Katy Daley
    Can't you hear us calling, Katy Daley
    We want to drink your good old mountain dew

With her old man she came from Tampararay
In the pioneer days of '42
Her old man was shot in Tombstone City
For the making of his good old mountain dew

  

Wake up and pay attention Katy Daley
I am the judge that's gonna sentence you
All the boys at court has drunk the whiskey
And tell the truth, drink a little too

  

So to the jail they took poor Katy Daley
And very soon the gates were opened wide
Angels came to court Katy Daley
Too her far across the Great DivideJust when I needed you
You left and went away
You made my life so blue
Both night and day
You left me here behind
With a troubled worried mind
So broaken hearted too
Just when I needed you

    I've cried, I've cried
    I've played, I've tried
    To forget you and never call your name
    What a shame, what a shame
    You're the one that was to blame
    You're the one that proved untrue
    Just when I needed you

You said it's best we part
And never loved again
And though it broke my heart
I won't complain
You know I love you still
And dear, always will
Although you proved untrue
Just when I needed youI've a home prepared where the saints abide
Just over in the glory land
And I long to be by my Saviour's side
Just over in the glory land

    Just over ( over ) in the glory land
    I'll join ( yes join ) the happy angel band
    Just over in the glory land
    Just over ( over ) in the glory land
    There with  ( yes with ) the mighty host I'll stand
    Just over in the glory land

I am on my way to those mansions fair
Just over in the glory land
There to sing God's praises and his glory share
Just over in the glory land

  

What a joyful thought that my Lord I'll see
Just over in the glory land
And with kindred saved, there forever be
Just over in the glory land

  

With the blood washed throng I will shout and sing
Just over in the glory land
Glad hosannas to Christ, the Lord and King
Just over in the glory landJust one year since you told me you loved me
And said, love, we never would part
But a link in the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad and aching heart

Will you take back everything that I gave you
Your ring, that little lock of hair
It's a card with your picture, sweetheart, on it
There'll never be another girl so fair

Hand in hand we walked along together
Hand in hand we walked along in pride
Hand in hand we walked along together
Honey, down by that big river side

I will take back everything that I gave you
that ring, that little lock of hair
But keep the card with your picture, sweetheart, on it
There'll never be another girl so fairWe'll I've traveledaround this world
I've seen lost of pretty girls
No one like you, no one like you
For your love is warm and kind
And it eases a worried mind
Loving you, just loving you

The sweetest love I ever knew
Is the love I get from you
Always keep on loving you
You hold the key to my heart
And I know we'll never part
Foever I'll be loving you

Oh I know there is no doubt
You're the one I can't live without
Loving you, only you
For every dream that I dream
And I know that I always will
Be loving you, just loving you

After travelin' around this world
There is no other girl
To take the place of loving you
We've known each other for so long
And our love is going strong
I'll always keep on, loving youJust because you think you're so pretty
Now just because you think you're so hot
Just because you think you've got something
That no other girl has got
You caused me to spend all my money
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
But I'm telling you honey I'm through with you because, just because

Just because you think you're so pretty
Now just because you think you're so hot
Just because you think you've got something
That nobody else has got
You caused me to spend all my money
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Well I'm telling you honey I'm through with you because, just becauseJust another day, how can I stand it
Without my baby by my side
This empty feeling now inside me
Is bound to show, but I can't cry

    Just make mine straight without a chaser
    And let me drown my blues this way
    The seat eside me now is empty
    Nothing to live for just another day

A thief could rob and take my money
If death was pending I could pray
I'm helpless now, what can my fate be
Everything is gone, just another day

  * RefainI ain't a-gonna worry who's kissing you
When I'm far away
Because I know when the tom can't gone
All the mice will play

Walking down the street
I ain't a-gonna care who's the other guy
That you go to meet

  

I ain't a-gonna care if you don't come back
I'll get alone all right

    When I don't hear from you, I get nervous inside
    And it seems I go to pieces, my feelings I can't hide
    When I hear my number ringing, my frey skies turn to blue
    When you're many miles away dear, just a phone call will do

When I go to bed at night dear, a little prayer I always say
I'm thankful for the moment, God sent you my way
If I had the power to change things, I'd be right there with you
Many miles now separate us, just a phone call will doI once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole

    Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
    Let us tell Him all about our troubles
    He will hear our famished cry
    He will answer by and by
    Now when you feel a little prayer turning
    And you know the little talk with Jesus makes it right

Sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
And then the cloud about me hides the light of day
The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way

  

I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears
But jesus is a freind who watches day and and night
I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

  
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Makes everything rightWhen John Henry was a little baby boy, sitting on the his papa's knee
Well he picked up a hammer and little piece of steel
Said Hammer's gonna be the death of me, lord, lord
Hammer's gonna be the death of mine

The captain said to John Henry
I'm gonna bring that steam drill around
I'm gonna bring that sterm drill out on the job
I'm gonna whup that steel on down

John Henry told his captain
Lord a man ain't nothing but a man
But before I'd let your steam drill beat me down
I'd die with a hammer in my hand

John Henry asid to his shaker
Shaker why don't you sing
Because I'm swinging thirty pounds from my hips on down
Just listen to that cold steel ring

Now the captain said to John Henry
I believe that mountain's caving in
John Henry said right back to the captain
Ain't nothing but my hammer sucking wind

Now the man that invented the steam drill
He thought he was mighty fine
But John Henry srove fifteen feet
The steam drill only made nine

John Henry hammered in the mountains
His hammer was striking fire
But he worked so hard, it broke his poor heart
And he laid down his hammerand he died

NOw John Henry had a little woman
Her name was polly Anne
John Henry took sick and had to go to bed
Polly Anne drove steel like a man

John Henry had a little baby
You could hold him in the palm of your hand
And the last words I heard that poor boy say 
My daddy was a steel driving man

So every Monday morning
When the blue dirds begin to sing
You can hear John Henry a mile or more
You can hear John Henry's hammer ringJohn Hardy was a desperate little man
He carried two guns every day
He shot down a man on that West Virginia line
You oughta seen John Hardy getting away
You oughta seen John Hardy getting away

John Hardy stood in that old barroom
So drunk that he could not see
And a man walked up and took him by the arm
He said Johnny, come and go along with me
Poor boy, Johnny, come and walk along with me

John Hardy stood in his old jail cell
The tears running down from his eyes
He said I've been the death of many a poor boy
But my six-shooters never told a lie
No, my six-shooters never told a lie

The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue
She came down to that old jail cell
She said Johnny, I've been true to you
God knows, Johnny, I've been true to you

The next one to Visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in red
She come down to that old jail cell
She said, Johnny, I had rather see you dead
Well, Johnny, I had rather see you dead

I've been to the East and I've been to the West
I've traveled this wide world around
I've been to that river and I've been baptized
So take me to my burying ground
So take me to my burying ground

John Hardy was a desperate little man
He carried two guns every day
He shot down a man on the West Virginia line
You oughta seen old John Hardy getting away
You oughta seen old John Hardy getting awayYou will hear me yelling, Morning Star
As I run along the street
I have no hat upon my head
No shoes upon my feet
I'm awful cold and hungry sir
My clothes are torn and thin
I wonder about from place to place
My daily bread to win

    I sell the morning papers sir
    My name is Jimmie Brown
    Most everybody knows I am
    The newsboy of the town

Never mind, sir, how I look
Don't look at me and frown
I sell the morning papers sir
My name is Jimmie Brown
My father was a drunkard sir
I've heard my mother say
And I am helping mother sir
As I journey on my way

  

My mother always tells me sir
I've nothing in the world to lose
I'll get a place in heaven sir
To sell the Gospel News
So never mind sir how I look
Don't look at me and frown
I sell the morning papers sir
My name is Jimmie BrownAs I go along I'm singing this song
My soul is so glad and free
If I sing this song, I'll never go wrong
For Jesus will care for me

    Yes, Jesus will save your soul
    He'll make you as pure as gold
    Then some beautiful day
    With him you as shall stay
    Where sorrows are never told

He pleads day by day don't turn him away
Hark to that sweet voice you hear
Place him close to your side, in his love abide
Let Jesus always stand near

  

If you would live right for Jesus tonight
Turn from your pathway of sin
Some day by his throne he'll make it your home
Where happiness never endsWhen my life is in despair
Jesus answers my prayers
When I call on him he's there
Jesus answers my prayers

When trouble and strife cloud my life
When no one else seems to care
I fall on my knees
And pray to Him there
And Jesus answers my prayers

He lifts my burdens, stills my fears
Jesus answers my prayers
He gives me confort, sries my tears
Jesus answers my prayersWent down to the station, not many days ago
Did something I'll never do again
I got down on my knees and selivered up the keys
To Frank and his brother, Jesse James

    O, Jesse leaves a wife, she's a mourner all her life
    And the children, they were brave
    But the dirty little coward, he shot Mister Howard
    And he laid poor Jesse in his grave

O, Jesse was a man and friend to the poor
He would never see a man suffer pain
But with he brother Frank, he robbed the Chicago bank
And he stopped the Glendale train

  

O, the people in the West, when they heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he came to die
It was Ford's pistol ball brought him tumbling from the wall
And it laid poor Jesse down to die

  

Now Jesse goes to rest with his hands upon his breast
And the devil will be upon his knees
He was born one day in the county of Clay
And he came from a solitary race

  

This song it was made by Billy Gashade
As soon as the news did arrive
He said there was no man with the law in his hand
Who could take Jesse James when aliveOh Sally, oh Sally, 'tis for your sake alone
That I leave my old parents, my house and my home
That I leave my old parents, you cause me to roam
I'm an old rambling cowpoke and the range is my home

    Jack O' diamonds, Jack O' diamonds, I know you of old
    You've robbed by poor pockets of silver and gold
    Oh, whiskey, you villain, you've been my downfall
    You've punched me and kicked me, but I love you for all

My foot's in my stirrup, my bridle's in my hand
I'm going to leave Sally, the fairest in the land
Her Daddy don't like me, he says I'm too poor
He says I'm unworthy to enter her door

  

They say I drink whisky, my money is my own
And them that don't like me can leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry, I'll drink when I'm dry
I'll do what I please and I'll live 'till I die

  

I'll get you up in my saddle, my quirt in my hand
I'll think of you, Sally when in some distant land
I'll think of you, Sally you caused me to roam
I'm an old rambling cowpoke and the range is my homeI wouldn't change a single thing about you if I could
The way are just suits me to a tee
A princess in a story book, a king upon a throne
That's what you are and you belong to me

    I wouldn't change you if I wishe for, if I wished upon a star
    You're all that I would wish for, if I wished upon a star
    An angel sent from heaven, you're everything that's good
    You're perfect just the way you are, I wouldn't cange you if I could

Your eyes, your lips, your tender smile, I'd leave them as they are
And come what may, I'd never change a thing
Ane if I were a potter and you aiece of clay
The only thing I'd change would be your nameTonight I'm sad my heart is weary
Wonder if I'm wrong or righyt
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight

    The rain is cold and slowly falling
    Upon my window pane tonight
    And though your love grows even colder
    I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared

  

Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
The lingers in my heart tonightWell I wonder how the old folks are at home
I wonder if they miss me while I roam
I wonder if they pray for the boy who went away
And left his dear old parents all alone

    You could hear the cattle lowing in the lane
    You could see the fields of blue grass where I've grown
    You could almost hear them cry as they kissed their boy goodbye
    Well I wonder how the old folks are at home

Just a village and a homestead on the farm
And a mother's love to shield you from all harm
A mother's love so true, a sweetheart that loves you
A village and a homestead on the farmI wish you knew
    How hard I try to tell you
    How hard I try to get you off my mind
    I wish you knew
    How hard I try to sleep at night
    Since I know that you're no longer mine
    That you left another beat my time

If only half the thing were true
You say about my heart
Then I could have forgotton you
Since we've been apart
You said I forced my lips to kiss you
When we said good-bye
You ever said I forced the tears 
That come into my eyes

  

There's not a thought
That could be worse then knowing that you're gone
But in the picture in your mind
I'm never all alone
You see me in another's arms
Just like I've been with you
But the way I cry for you at night
I only wish you knewYou take your flower dress from the chair beside the bed
That's morning in the window looking cloudy
It's the coldest thing I've ever seen the way you dress today
Now that it's good-bye for you and me
I wish I said I love me one more time
But if I ask don't tell me, what did it matter
If I said I love you one more time

The rhythm of your hair fills your dresser mirror
You've combing out the night time we put there
It's the coldest things I've ever seen your hair upon the mirror
Now that it's the last time that I'll be here
I wish I said I love you one more time
But if I ask don't tell me, what did it matter
If I said I love you one more time

Our words have all been said there's nothing else to do
We can take them back if we went to
And that's how people freeze to death alone in tented rooms
Starting with a cold like me and you
I wish I said I love you one more time
But if I ask don't tell me, what did it matter
If I said I love you one more timeIt's been many weeks my dear since you told me
That you loved me so dearly and true
But today it seems to me you have changed dear
For you're telling me that our love is through

    When you're far, far away from me darling
    If you're sad and you don't know what to do
    And you feel that no one cares about you
    I will always be waiting for you

Oh, I can't forget the day that you told me
That you'd love me and be my sweetheart
But it looks like my dear you've forgotten
For you say now that we have to part

  

All the days seem so lonesome and dreary
And the nights are so lonely and blue
Since you left me alone here without you
Oh, please come back I'm waiting for youI want someone to help me in my sorrow
And someone whose heart is alwats true
And someone who will stay with me forever
I want to be loved but only by you

    I want to be kissed but only by your lips, dear
    For you're the only one who'll ever do
    I want someone to hug and call me Honey
    I want to be loved but only by you

If ever you decide to love me, darling
And tell me that your heart to me is true
Then we'll be happy in a home together
I want to be loved but only by youWell I wanta be a Christian soldier
In the army of our Lord
I'm gonna tell the love of Jesus
Till my life down here is o'er
I'm gonna tell the world he died for me
Tell em how he died in shame
Yes I wanta be a Christian soldier
And fight in my Savior's name

    I love my Savior
    He loves me too
    I'll be His soldier
    Till my life's work is through

Well I wanta March through the valleys
Then I wanta March up the hill
And I wanta sing about the love of God
And do his blessed will
Oh, I wanta drink from the fountain
Be baptised in his love
And I wanta be there when the roll is called
On the home coming day aboveI've waited fot you and I've always been true
But this waiting no longer I can stand
I know you've had time dear to make up your mind
I've waited as long as I can

    I've waited to hear you say you love me
    And long fot the day you take my hand
    I ask again last night fot your love so divine
    I've waited as long sa I can

Done all I can do said all I can say
Oh why can't I make you understand
No one will ever know the pain that I've been thru
I've waited as long as I can

  

Now I'll just say goodbye and a tear fall from my eye
For you have made it plain that I can win
I know you've had time dearto make up your mind
I've waited as long as I canAs I sat down to a gambhling game I could hardly play my hand
For thinking about that woman I love, run away with another man
Run away with another man, poor boy, run away with another man
I'm thinking about that woman I love, run away with another man

I bought her everything she needs I dressed her up so fine
She caused me to work for forty years, I've still got ninety nine
I've still got ninety nine, poor boy, I've still got ninety nine
She coused me to work for forty years, I've still got ninety nine

I stroll down to the old depot just to watch the train roll by
I looked in the window saw the woman I loved, hung sown my head and cried
Hung down my head and cried poor boy, hung down my head and cried
I looked in the window saw the woman I loved, hung down my head and cried

They took me down to the old jailhouse, the door they slammed on me
Said if you'll report that moonshine still, I'll see that you got free
I'll see that you go free poor boy, I'll see that you go free
If you'll report that moonshine still, I'll see that you go free

I told my age was twenty one, the truth I told that time
Before I'll report that moonshine still, I'll go and serve my time
I'll go and serve my time poor boy, I'll go and serve my time
Before I'll report that moonshine still, I'll go and serve my timeFriends tell me that told you wed another
They say you look so happy all the time
I just can't realize that I have lost you
Somehow I thought you always would be mine

    I've love you since the day that I first met you
    I thought no one could ever come between
    Those promises you made have all been broken
    And all have to live for now is grief

Somehow I can't believe that you'll be happy
With memories to haunt you night and day
But only time can make you learn your lesson
I'm sure you think you've reached your goal today

  

I never thought someday that I would lose you
You're just the kind that never could be true
You only wanted me just for a while dear
Just long enough to break my heart in twoI've got bluegrass on my mind, heading back to old Kentucky
Where the mountains look so pretty in the spring
When the dew is on the bluegrass sparkling with the sun's good morning
I've got good old bluegrass on my mind again

    Let me hear the fox hounds running
    High at night among the nountains
    And then later when the fox horn blows them in
    Let me hear the roosters crowing
    Smell the ham and bacon frying
    I've got good old bluegrass on my mind again

In a little cabin home where your neighbor was your neibor
And the bluegrass started growing every spring
There we danced on Saturday night to fiddle and a banjo
I've got old bluegrass on my mind againBorn in the mountains fifty years ago
I've trod the hills and valleys through the rain and snow
I've seen the lightning flashing I've heard the thunder roll
I've Endured, I've Endured how long can one endure

Barefoot in the summer on into the fail
Too many mouths to feed they couldn't clothe us all
Sent to church on Sunday to learn the golden rule
I've Endured, I've Endured how long can one endured

I've worked for the rich, I've lived with the poor
I've see many a heartache, there'll be many a more
Lived, loved and sorrowed been to success's door
I've Endured, I've Endured how long can one enduredOh its raining raining raining here this morning
As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name

Mary a little raindropps are fallin close to me
Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be
Its raining raining raining here this morning
As the Mississippi flows on to the sea

How I wish that I could see my little darling
And hole her in my arms just as before
I used to tell her every day I loved her
But now she doesn't love me anymore

She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime
And said that she'd be waiting there for me
But she has found somebody else to wander
Where the Mississippi folws on to the sea

Its raining raining raining here this morning
And I am just as weary as can be
I wish that I could follow all the raindropps
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea

But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty
So I will have to suffer all the shame
Go and tell her for me little raindrops
That they've given me a number for my nameShe would sit by her window and gaze out
Down the road where her children had gone
One by one they left seeking their fortune
And left their old mother alone

Sometime late at night she would call me
Sir did I here a knock at the door
I would say it was only the wind man
Just as I had told her before

    It's only the wind
    Your children are not at the door
    It's only the wind
    The wind restless wind, nothing more

Sometime she would talk of her children
Of her son and her doughter so fair
She said they were much like the wild wind
They sometime neglected to care

One night I heard somebady knocking
But I saw as I went to the door
She was there in her chair by the window
Her eyes closesd in rest forever moreNow darling I've loved, I've never done wrong
I've been fair to you you know all along
Why treat me this way you're breaking my heart
I'm lonesome for you we're so far apart

    Its never too late to start over new
    I've loved you so long you know I've been true
    Please come back to me my heart is so blue
    It's never to late to start over new

Now when you are tried your new love gone down
I hope you'll return I'll still be around
I love you so well you know I will wait
But remember these words, it's never too lateIt's been quite a while since I've seen you my dear
I've been gone a long, long time
All these nights on the road I've been talking to myself
I can't believe I left you behind

    It's in my mind to ramble, I hope you understand
    Sometime I find I just have to go
    I know it's hard, my darling, forgive me if you can
    For you know that I love you so

Now back in the days when we were together
You were always so good and kind
But one night I stole away and I took to the road
I guess I just don't know my mind

  

And now I'm coming back to our home, honey babe
Please accept me though I've been wrong
I think my wandering ways are going to vanish in a haze
And I'll realize that's where I belongIt's a grand to have someone to love you
Someone who knows your every care
Someone to cheer you when you're lonely
Just call for her and she'll be there

    The kind of love that you can treasure
    The kind of love that stands the test
    It's grand to have someone to love you
    Someone to hold you to their brest

It's grand to have someone to love you
Who thinks you're king upon her throne
Then she's the queen of all your treasures
Your castle is a happy homeYou can hang around and love you
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall but I won't fall
Kiss me when your dreamin note that will do
Its good bye and so long to you

You can send me pretty flowers
You can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won't pay
Dream of my desire nothing else will do
Its good bye and so long to you

You can give me your affection
You can give me all your love
Give me all the things I crave but I'll be brave
All the things you offer make me sad and blue
Its good bye and so long to you

You can call me your own darling
You can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone, I won't be home
Keep your old love letter, I'm all though with you
Its good bye and so long to you
Its good bye and so long to youIts a long way to the top of the world
But its only a short fall back down

A young fool filled with green, I let ambition rule me
Like a hunger that gnawed at my soul
I worked hard made my fortune but lost the heart of my darling
She got lonely and her love soon grew cold

    Its a long long way to the top of the world
    On a rough road that winds round and round
    Its a long long way to the top of the world
    But its only a short fall back down

Now I'm a big man with money but at love I'm a pauper
Though what I once had now another man claims
I've reached the top of the world but my heart hit rock bottom
I can't make love to fortune and fameLittle girl you stand out in the crowd
You're laughing and talking much to loud
But I see a little tear peaking through
It takes one to know one and I know you

    It takes one to know one and I know you
    The little tear through your smiles I see through
    You've been hurt and your frightened you're so blue
    It takes one to know one and I know you

LIttle girl please take hold of my hand
Just go right on and cry I'll understand
Pay nomind if start crying too
It takes one to know one and I know you

  

  It take one to know one and I know youI'm walking the floor with tears in my eyes
I can't understand dear why you ever lie
The stars in the skies have tumbled below
Now my heart is breaking it's beating so low

    The moment you walking dear into my heart
    What a wonderful meeting for two lonely hearts
    You gave me your love to have and to hold
    But something has happened you took the wrong road

You said you would you love and you would obey
But the Golden Rule's broken so go on your way
I've lost all the faith that I've had in you
So go on away dear you could never be trueAt my door the leaves are falling
A cold night wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

No I mever got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
When all the love was thereIs it too late now to tell you that I love you
    Or is there still a chance for me somehow
    Oh, they tell me now that you have found another
    Darling, please don't say it's too late now

I know this heart of mine could never stand it
If I should have to give you up somehow
Oh, won't you say you'll give me one more shance, dea
Darling, please don't say it too late now

  

Well I'll confuse I know I've done you wrong, dear
Oh, can't you see my side of it somehow
All ask of you is one more chance, dear
Darling, please don't say it's too late nowI saw your face in the moon, honey
You threw a smile at me
You pretended that you were happy
But in those lovin eyes I could see
You were having blue thoughts of bygones
Days you and I once knew
Blue I could see your smile
And it faded with the gloom
When I saw your face in the moon honey
When I saw your face in the moonSilver coins that jingle jingle
Fancy shose that dance in time
Oh the secrets of her dark eyes
They did sing a gypsy thyme

Yellow clover in tangled blossoms
In a melted silky green
Where she held me to her bosom
Just a boy of seventeen

    I recall the gypsy woman
    Silver spangles in her eyes
    Ivory skin against the moonlight
    And the taste of lifes sweetwine

Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
Stir the darkness in my mind
Oh gentle woman you sleep beside me
A little gnome who haunts my mind

Oh gypsy lady I hear your laughter
And the dance is in my head
While my tender wife and baby
Slumber softly in their bedIn my dear old home
I was happy as I could be
Where the mocking birds sang every night while I rest
In that little old log cabin by the sea

There is Mother and dear old Dad
Where I left I know it made them sad
So I'm going back to that dear old shack
Where I spent my happy days as a lad

Goodbye friends I'm leaving today
Goodbye friends I'm going far away
I'll be happy as can be on my dear old Mother's knee
In that little old log cabin by the seaWe wandered beneath the shadows of the pine my love and I
While the winds were blowing gently o'er the sea
Then a sad and fateful darkness strolled across the stormy sky
And a shadow came between my love and I

You ask me for those letters taht you wrote so long ago
But for them I could not give to you my dear
Let me keep them to remember of those days of long ago
Let my keep them to remember you my dear

    Come back to me sweetheart and love me as before
    Beg, beg to me sweetheart and leave me never more
    For life's dark pathway the sun no longer shines
    Come love and meet me in the shadows of the pain

You took the ring I gave you not one glance you cast at me
As you held the jewel twinkling in your hand
And then you turned and cast it in the waters of the sea
While the waves were splashing idly on the sandThe longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed six o'clock
And cab passed by at nine

    In the pines, in the pine
    Where the sun never shine
    And we shiver when the cold wind blows

I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel ram and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home

  

Little girl, little girl
What have I do that makes you treat me so ?
You caused me to weep you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home

  
�@One morning as I rambled all down the seashore
The wind it did whistle, and the waters did roar
I heard a fair damsel make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around

    I never will marry, or be no man's wife
    I expect to live shingle all the days of my life
    The shells in the ocean shall be my death bed
    The fish in deep water swim over my head

She plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her blue eyes in the waters to sleep
My love's gone and left me, the one I abore
She's gone where I never will see her anymoreI needed you when I met you
You were just playing around
While I painted dreams of our everlasting love
You were just painting the town
Then when you said it was over
I found the heart good and true
Now that it's too late you've descovered
You needed me like I needed youYou must me love you, you made me want you
And now I need you all the time
My heart is sad and I'm so lonely
Each night and day you're on my mind

    You broke me heart my little darling
    When I called for you, you had another there
    But a broken heart will keep on crying
    I know you know, I'm in despair

You made me forget of all the other
You made me forger of all the pain
And I thought sweetheart you really loved me
My friends told me it would never lastOh, today, I'm so sad and so lonely
The skies are dark and gray
And I'm wondering how much longer I can stand it
To go on suffering this way

Remember, at our last meeting
It seemed so hard to part
Now you know dear how much I love you
And I'm willing to give you my heartI'm walking, yes indeed
    And I'm talking about you and me
    And I hoping that you'll come back to me
    I'm lonely as can be
    And I'm walking your company
    And I'm hoping that you'll return to me

What're you gonna do when a woman'drunk
You're gonna sit right and cry
And I'll be right here by your side
And for you pretty baby I even die

  

  

What're you gonna do when a woman's drunk
You're gonna sit right and cry
And I'll be right here by your side
And for you pretty baby I even dieTwo years ago when I first met you
You smiled at me and looked so sweet
You made me think you cared about me
But you never said that you loved me

    I'm waiting to hear you call me darling
    I'm waiting to hear you call me dear
    You know that I have always loved you
    Don't make me lonely all there years

Oh maybe I've took too much for granted
To think you could ever love me
please oh, please don't try to fool me
All you cause is miseryI'm using my Bible for a road map
Then Commandments they tell me what to do
The twelve disciples are my road signs
And Jesus will take me safely through

    There'll be no detours in heaven
    No rough roads along the way
    I'm using my Bible for a road map
    My last stop is heaven some sweet day

I'm using my Bible for a road map
The children of Israel used it too
They crossed the Red Sea of Destuction
For God was there to see them throughI'm traveling road this lonesome road oh how I hate to go
    The wind and storm a'raging high and it's awful cold
    My mind drifts back to you sweetheart and I love you so
    Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road

I remember dear not long ago you said you'd be my own
I never thought that you'd go away leave me all alone
The kind of love you had for me I find sweetheart grows old
But now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road

  

All I do is roam around and look for you may dear
I know I've seached ten thousand miles oh how I need you dear
You broke my heart you left me here now I'm growing old
Why did you go and leave me dead to travel this lonesome roadOH, I was lost in the darkness and I wandered astray
With no one to help me see along on my way
Until I heard Jesus calling, saving
Come unto me and I'm traveling on and on

    Oh, Lord I'm traveling on by my Savior
    And I can never stray for Jesus leads the way
    And I'll get off the wagon at the ened of my journey
    Oh, Lord, I'm traveling on and on

Oh, I can hear Jesus calling and His voice sounds so sweet
And I know that the time had come to kneel at His feet
But my troubles are over for He did me come home
And I'm traveling on and on

  

Oh, the on Lord is my Savior and my hope it will stay
He will help me and protect me to the end of the way
My journey will soon be over and I'll join the happy band
And I'm traveling on and onI'm thinking about you and hoping you're true
There long weary nights I'm going thru
I'm never glad I'm talways sad
Darling you know I'm thinking about you

    Darling you know what we've been thru
    Darling you know we can't be untrue
    I'm doing my part I'm trusting your heart
    Sweetheart you know I'm thinking about you

When you were a littlw girl and I a little boy
We promised our love to share and enjoy
But the time has come when I'm far away
Thinking about you both night and day

  

I'll say my love you must do the same
To make all our dreams we promise come true
I'm doing my part, I'm trusting your heart
Darling you know I'm thinking about youHear that lonesome whip-poor-will
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the cloud
To hide it's face and cry

Did you every hear a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up the purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cryI'm on my way (I'm on my way) to Canaan's land (to Canaan's land)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way) to Canaan's land (to Canaan's land)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way) to Canaan's land

I'm on my way (Praise the Lord) I'm on my wayWhen Louisville was eight more miles away my old heart sung a song
Well I thought I'd hug kiss my gal before so very long
But when I got to Louisville I found she wasn't true
So I'll tell you all about it now that's why I feel so blue

    When I got to Louisville my gal she wasnt there
    They sais she'd gone with someone else it was more than I could dear
    So I'm heading out of this old town, where to I don't much care
    Louisville is eight miles back and I'm on my way somewhere

I always dreamed of some sweet day when she could be my wife
And we would settle down somewhere and lead a happy life
But now I know just how things are and how they'd always be
So I know now Louisville just ain't the place for me

Right now I'm traveling down this road to get her off my mind
The thind I want to do is leave old Louisville behind
Who knows I may find fappiness and one who fills the bill
A girl htat's true and not like her that lives in LouisvilleBack inthe day of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to listen to the foxes
And my dad in them old Kentucky hills

    I'm on my way back to the old home
    That road winds on up the hill
    But there's no light in the window
    That shines long ago where I lived

Soon my childhood days are over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mom was called to heavebn
We'll I'm left in this world all alone

  

High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands a fond spot in my memory
I'm on my way back to the old home
That light in the window I want to seeWhen we were young and loved each other
More than any one will know
But that day you found a new love
And you said I had to go

    Oh the road is rough and rocky
    Since the day I last saw you
    Another won your heart forever
    And I'm lonesome without you

On down this lonely road I wander
With nothing left for me to do
Wondering if I'll ever see you
And share the love that we once knew

  

My hope is now that you'll be happy
With the new love you have found
But if you should ever change your mind dear
Remember me, I'll be aroundAlone and lonesome, I'm sad and I'm blue
Just thinking of you and the love that we knew
How well I remember when I told you that day
I wanted my freedom, I was going away

    Now that I'm free I'm lonesome and blue
    I just can't forget all the love that we knew
    I let someone's kisses lead my heart astray
    I said I'd forget you that was easy to say

I'll always love you though we're far apart
I just can't hide these tears in my heart
So clearly in dream I can vision your face
In hurts me to know someone's taken my placeI'm not in your town to stay said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
I'm not in your town to stay and I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

I've tried to raiser my baby right, I have prayed both day and night
that he'd never follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide, I had feared that he had died
And at last I find my baby here in jail
Yes, warden, but it's good to find my baby here in jail

I will pawn you my watch, I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will wash all your clothes, I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes, warden, you know I want my baby out of jail

Then I heard the wanden say to the lady old and gray
I will send your baby boy to your side
Those wide gates swung wide apart, she held her darling to her heart
She kissed her darling boy and then she died
But smiling in the arms of her boy there she diedGo now, don't wait please don't hesitate
    Lovin' you was my great sin
    And I might take you back again

For a long time the world stood still
I loved you then and I always will
But to me you've been untrue
And there is nothing I can do

  

Well, here you're, you're back again
I know that I just can't win
You broke my heart most everyday
And now you'd best bo on your wayI think I'll go across the ocean
If I don't change my notion
I've just got to forget you if I can

    Oh I'm feeling so blue
    That I don't know what to do
    For I'm head over heels in love with you

Everyday is sad and lonely
While I'm thinking of you only
Oh I just can't sleep when I lay down

  

All the night are long and dreary
All I do is sit and worry
I just can't bear the thought of losing you

  

Oh I'd like to be forgiven
But this life ain't worth livin'
If I have to sit and worry over you

  

Oh I'm head over heels in love with youI just found out today the little game you play
I've been sleeping all my life away
You've been strepping so they say between midnight and day
So I'm honna sleep with one eye open from now on

    From now on from now on all night long all night long
    You won't have a chance to treat your daddy wrong
    You've been stepping so they say between midnight and day
    So I'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on

There's honky tonk down the road just a mile or so
I understand that's where you spend your time
Baby I got news for you your little game is through
From now on baby you're gonna tow the line

  

You thought you were being wise running around with other guys
And leaving me to spend my time alone
But you'll find out today it don't work out that way
You started a little game that two can playTonight I'm all alone, no place to call my own
Don't have no one to love me anymore
I'm gonna pack up my grip
And take a long, long trip
Back to the one that I love so

    Oh I long to go back to my darling
    Back to the one I love so well
    I know she'll be my wife
    When we settle down for life
    'Cause she's the one that means the world to me

I can't forget the day I left and went away
You told me I'd be sorry some old day
I found it to be true
So I'm heading back to you
Sweetheart, I'm tired and want to settle down

  

When I get back to her my rambling days are o'er
We'll build a little cottage on the hill
We'll think of day's gone by
Sweetheart, just you and I
And there we'll live so happy ever moreWell, I've been walked on and I've been stepped on
I've been kicked when I was down
Honey I've been too tied treated unkind
I've been hard and pushed around
And I thought I'd never find love
Till one day you came along
Now I'm a new man and I've got a feeling
I'm gonna make it after all

    I've strolled I guess down the road of happiness
    Where all my things or times I recall
    Now I'm a new man and I've got a feeling
    I'm gonna make it after all

I've been fooled and led behind
Honey I've been shaking it was shaking
Just when I found love was mine
And I'm long so used to thinking
Love would never come along
You found me girl and I believe girl
I'm gonna make it after allI'm going down this road feeling bad
I'm going down this road feeling bad
I'm going down this road feeling bad, lord, lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

I'm down in that jail on my knees
I'm down in that jail on my knees
I'm down in that jail on my knees, lord, lord
I ain't gonna be treated this a-way 

They fed me on cornberad and beans, etc
Takes a ten dollar shoe to fit my feet, etc
'cause you two dollar shoes hurt my feet, etc
I'm going where the weather suits my clothes, etc
That's why I'm going down this road feeling bad, etcWhen I left old Kentucky
Linda kissed me and she cried
I told her that I would not wander
I'd be back by and by

    I'm going back to old Kentucky
    There tro see my Linda Lou
    I'm going back to old Kentucky
    Wher the skies are always blue

Linda Lou she is a beauty
those pretty brown eyes I loved so well
I'm going back to old Kentucky
Never more to say farewell

  

Linda Lou you know I love you
I long for you each night and day
When the roses bloom in old Kentucky
I'll be coming back to stayI'm going down this lonesome road
    To find my fate or victory
    Our God must help us there to win
    I'm coming back but I don't know when

I hate to leave my mother dear
My father who is old and gray
But my true love I know will wait
Till come back to you some day

  

When I come back will you be here
Or will your love fade like a rose
I can never come back and find you gone
My love for you nobody knowsI once had a sweetheart to love me
But now she has proven untrue
She's found a new love to treasure
That's why I'm walking round blue

    The lies you told me are over
    The heart you broke is gone
    And friends they tell me I'm lucky
    I'm better off now that you're gone

You broke my heart when you loved me
I've always counted on you
But now you've strayed with another
LIttle girl what more could I do

  

Some day I know you'll be sorry
You led my poor heart astray
You seemed to think it was funny
But some say darling you'll pay

  
I'm better off now that you're goneOh, I'm afraid my darlin's gone
    She won't be there when I get home
    My heart beats true for you mu dear
    And losing you has been my fear

The road is dark and cold tonight
I see your face in each head light
And as I travel all alone
I pray you're there when I get home

  

The love I have for you is real
It's not the kind someone can steal
I know someday when I get home
My heart will break to find you goneI'm travellin' down life's sorrowful pathway
Searching for a place to stay
Nobody seems to care about me
Since Mom and Dad have passed away

    I'm a stranger here in this world of sorrow
    Travelin' through this world alone
    I have no promise of tommorrow
    No place on earth to call my home

Nobody knows the life I'm livin'
All the troubles I've gone though
I'm just a poor and helpless atranger
In this old world my friends are few

  

My journey here will soon be ended
No more in sadness will stray
I'll meet my dear old Dad and Mother
In that lovely land so far awayI'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this worrisome land
I've got a home in that yonder city
And it's not (God Load it's not)
Not made by hand

I've got a mother a sister and a brother
Who have gone on before
And I'm determined to go and meet them, good load
Over on that other shore

I'm going down to the river of Jordan
Just to cleanse my weary soul
If I could touch but the hem of His garment, good load
I do believe it would make me wholeI'm a drifter like a rolling stone
    Like the Mississippi river gotta keep rolling on
    No one can ever tame me or ever hold me down
    When the sun comes up in the morning I'll be in another town

You think that you know me and that you love me true
There's no way that I can stay and spend my life with you
No one can ever tame me or hold me down
When the sun comes up in the morning I'll be in another town

  

Like any other lover she wanted me to settle down
There's too many waiting, waiting to be found
When you're lonely drifter the blues will come around
When the sun comes up in the morning I'll be in another townNow tonight as I write this note to you
There's sorrow in my heart
I hate to say good bye my dear
But it's better that we part

    Don't think that I've grown tried of you
    Of found somebody new
    For you were all I've ever had
    And I've loved no one but you

Now when you read this note my dear
I hope you'll understand 
And think of the one that loves you best
This broken hearted man

  

Now that I have loved and lost
I hope you're satisfied
It will be so hard to go through this word
With a broken heart insideWell I saw a man walking
His hands were in his pockets
Head was dragging looking at his feet
Well he looked up and saw me
And he asked me for a quarter
Or if I know a good cheap place to eat
Well I just shrugged my shoulders
Said if I could help you brother
I wouldn't be out walking on this beat
With nothing more to say
Just turned and went his way
Hopping for a richer man than me

    I long for the old home
    I long for the lills
    Swinging on the front porch
    Lord knows i ain't had my fill

Well I left home at fifteen
With a guitar and a dream
And a heart that needs a-learning more life
I never kept a job long
I never was the kind to settle down
Forever with a wife
Well I may have met some man
That you read about in books
And there were times when I was living right
But I ain't got much to show
Here living on Skid Row
No one to help this old man through the nightI've slippen around dear two timen you
Having fun dear like some guys do
But now I'm sorry and now I'm thru
Forgive me darling its up to you

    But I can't blame you if you two time to
    Because I'm guilty for thing I do
    I've danced around love, played every game
    And if you leave me I'll take the blame

I've got no money I'm just a pauper
Tryin' to love on love dear without your love I'll die
So please don't leave whatever you do
Just squeeze me darling while I'm loving youIt's been many years since we were childhood sweethearts
Blisaful days that I never shall forget
And you know I stil I love you, little darling
Though the years bring me only regret

    Oh, I love you, my darling, how I love you
    If I talk will you try to understand
    It's no matter how you treat me I love you
    And I'll still write your name in the sand

Though the long lonely years I have loved you
And I've waited, but only in vain
Now I know that I've lost you, my darling
But I'll still sing the same old refrain

  

Now I know that your heart was for another
And it grieves me more than I can stand
Though I've lost the only one that I care for
I will still write your name in the sandNow you just told me that you're leavin' 
On the next train comin' down
My love so dear you think I'll follow
I just think I'll stay around

    For I know someday you'll want me
    When the true love can't be found
    But if you go dear I won't follow
    I just think I'll stay around

Now you know dear I'll always love you
And would never let you down
But if you go dear I won't follow
I just think I'll stay around

  

Someday I'll hear that whistle blowin'
On the special coming down
You'll be looking for me baby
But I may not be aroundWhen the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars
And the beautiful moon sweeps the sky
When the dew drops of heaven are kissing the rose
It is then that my memory flies

Upon the wings of some beautiful dove
To hasten the message of cheer
I'll send you a kiss of affection and say
I'll remember you, Love, in my prayers

When the angels of heaven are guarding the good
As God has ordained them to do
In answer to prayers that I offered to Him
I know there's one waiting for you

Go where you will on land or on sea
I'll share all your sorrows and cares
And at night when I kneel by my bedside to pray
I'll remember you, Love, in my prayers

May the angels be with you and guard you through life
And guide you up Heaven's bright stairs
And know that I love you wherever you roam
I'll remember you, Love, in my prayersI used to sit up all night and worry little darling
For I thought you meant the world to me
But now things have changed and those days are gone forever
Oh,I'll never she'd  another tear

    I'll never she'd another tear now I don't care what happens
    You have proved your love untrue to me
    There's nothing you can do that will ever change  my feeling
    So I'llnever she'd another tear

With a broken heart I'll never forget the vows you made together
The many times you told me not to fear
But now youy've forgotten and you've left me here forever
Oh, I'll never she'd another tear

  

Now you should have told me that you were nly fooling
Then I'd never have learned to love you so
Then I wouldn't have all these heartches my darling
Darling the day I see you goSince You went awy, the skies have turned togrey
I never knew I loved you this way
I can't live without you, and if you'll come back soon
Darling I'll never make you blue

I'll never make you blue, darling, I promise you
To be forever honest honest and true
The things I use to do, I'll quit them all for you
Darling, I'll never make you blue

Darling, I'm to blame, but I won't be the same
All I ask is one more chance
To prove what I can do darling, for you
I'll prove that I can make you happy, too

Please come back to me, don't leave me here to grieve
My life away tis a memory
Just let me alone and say you'll come back home
Darling, I can't live aloneI'll never love anybody but you, baby, baby
I'll never love anybody but you if you'll be my girl
Oh yes believe me it's true
Oh yes, I'll love nobody but you

I'll always be true to you, baby, baby
I'll always be true to you if you'll be my girl
Oh yes believe me it's true
Oh yes, I'll love nobody but you

I'll take you out every night, baby, baby
I'll take you out if you'll be my girl
Oh yes believe me it's true
Oh yes, I'll love nobody but youYou spurned the love I gave you darling
The love you once was proud to own
You've found someone whom you love better
And in my grief I'll walk alone

    I'll just pretend that I don't love you
    I'll just pretend that I don't care
    And when I meet you to face dear
    I'll turn my head, I'll just pretend

Those happy hours we spent together
Forever in my heart will live
That's all I have for each tomorrow
Though we will never meet again

  

I'll try my best to forget you
To love you now is such a sin
And as I'm facing all my freinds dear
They'll understand, I won't pertendDon't think I'll be hanging around
While you're having fun
I won't sit here crying over you
From now on when you step out
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
An' I'll go stepping too

    Yes, I'll go stepping too, my honey
    I'll go stepping too
    I'll lock the door, put out the cat
    An' I'll go stepping too

Now every time you come in late
We begin to fight
You tell me there are more fish in the sea
But the bait ain't what it used to be
And I've got news for you
Now after this when you step out
Then I'll go stepping too

  

From now on when you come in
An' you won't tell where you been
With your hair mussed up
An' your clothers don't fit you right
Don't start to yell if you find
I look the same way too
Then you will know that I have been
Stepping just like youSome glas morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

    I'll fly away ( O glory )
    I'll fly away ( in the morning )
    When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
    I'll fly away ( fly away )

When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away

  

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys shall never end
I'll fly awayI'll find another woman go find you another man
    One that you can show that you're the leader of the band
    Perhaps you'll love the only life you'll ever understand
    I'll find another woman go find you another man

You said that you're not happy with a baby on your knee
So you leave it all alone and go stepping out on me
Well every night you're on your way to that wild side of life
You can't stand the thought to be a mother or a wife

It seems you don't care about the kind of life you choose
You know that if yoiu bamble some day you're gonna lose
This big world around you will tumble in your hand
I'll have me another woman, you'll need another man

  

Down this highway of sorrow I'll leave to you alone
For I know you'll always feel that same old tumbling stone
Another man will see you and than he'll stumble on
He'll be a victum of a woman that's gone away

  *RefrainSlowly the long day turns to night
Soon they'll switch off the prison lights
And in my cell I'm making plans
To be at home with you again

    There walls and bars can't hold a dreaming man
    So I'll be home to tuck the babies in
    They can chain my body but not my mind
    So I'll break out again tonight

The warden thinks I'm in for life
All he's ever seen me wear is stripes
He don't know about my blue suit and my tie
That I wear when I'm with you at nightWhen my soul is singing in that promised land above
I'll be satisfied
Praising Christ the Saviour for redeeming grace and love
I'll be satisfied

    I'll be satisfied ( satisfied )
    I'll be satisfied ( satisfied )
    When my soul is resting in the presence of the Lord
    I'll be satisfied

Living in a city where the soul shall never die
I'll be satisfied
There to meet with loved ones nevermore to say goodbye
I'll be satisfied

  

When I meet the ransomed over on the golden shore
I'll be satisfied
There I'll join the angels singing praises evermore
I'll be satisfiedWhen the Saviour calls I will answer
When he calls for me I will hear
When the Saviour calls I will answer
I'll be somewhere listening for my name

    I'll be somewhere ( I'll be listening )
    I'll be somewhere ( I'll be listening )
    I'll be somewhere listening for my name ( yes for my name )
    I'll be somewhere ( I'll be listening )
    I'll be somewhere ( I'll be listening )
    I'll be somewhere listening for my name

If my heart is right when he calls me
If my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when he calls me
I'll be somewhere listening for my neme

  

If my robe is white when he calls me
If my robe is white I will here
If my robe is white when he calls me
I'll be somewhere listening for my nameI may be a little bit tight tonight
    But I'll be alright tomorrow
    Be alright tomorrow, be alright tomorrow
    I may be a alright tomorrow
    But I'll be alright tomorrow
    Cause my baby's coming home

Ever since she left me
Things ain't been right
I've been out drinking every night
I may be a alright tomorrow
But I'll be alright tomorrow
Cause my baby's coming home

  

I got a letter just today
She's coming home to stay
Said she'd never leave my arms again
I may be a little bit tight tonight
But I'll be alright tomorrow
Cause my baby's coming homeI'll deck my brow with roses the loved ones may be there
And gems that others gave me will shine within my hair
And even those who know me will think my heart in light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I'll be all smiles tonight

    I'll be all smiles tonight, Love, I'll be all smiles tonight
    Though my heart may break tomorrow, I'll be all smiles tonight

Oh when the dance commences, Oh how I wil rejoice
I'll sing the songs he taught me without a faulting voice
When the flattering ones come around me they'll think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I'll be all smile tonight

  

And when the room he entered with a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him as though he was a charm
And once he smiled upon her as once he'd smiled
They knew not what I suffered, they found no change in me

  

And when the dance is over and all have gone to rest
I'll think of him, dear Mother, the one that I love best
He once did love me dearly and ne'er from me would part
He sought not to deceive me, false friends have changed his heartThe day's are so lonely, the night are so long
Our home is a prison since you are gone
And I'll always wonder why our love didn't last
With no hope for tommorrow I'll live in the past

A door that won't knock, a phone that don't ring
The postman goes by and he don't leave a thing
A pain in my heart and tears in my eyes
My sweetheart has gone I'm left here to cry

I'm the biggest pretender you ever could see
I pretend you still love me false love couldn't be
And then I remember and I know that its true
For your with another and I know I've lost you

I'll just go on dreaming sweet dreams of the past
Of when you still love me and I thought it would last
But life is so short and time moves so fast
I'll never forget you as I live in the pastMy buddies tell me that I should be waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the christian life

    I won't lose a friends by heeding God's call
    For what iws a friend who'd want me to fall
    Otheres find pleasure in things I despise
    I like the christian life

My breddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I am happy though it burdens my soul
And I'll try to lead them to walk in the night
I like the christian lifeI left my gal in the mountains, left her standing in the rain
Went down to the railroad caught myself a midnight train
I beat my way into Georgia, landed in a gambling town
Got myself into trouble, shot a county sheriff down

The jury read the verdict, murder in the first degree
The judge said take this prisoner to the penitentiary
They put the handcuffs on me, put me on a pullman tain
Took me to Atlanta boys and tied me to a ball and chain

I left my gal in the mountains, left her standing all alone
Last night I dreamed I got a letter saying honey won't you come back home
She said she was sad and lonely, told me that her love was true
Then I dreamed I wrote her a letter saying honey I'm coming back to you

When I woke up this morning lying in Atlanta jail
No one here to love me no one to go my bail
Then prison bars all around me a guard walking by my door
My heart is sad and lonely boys cause I'll never see my gal no moreThe day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you throught eternity
Not knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'd always be close by your side

    You know I love you and I always will
    I know you're married but I love you still

You broke a heart, dear, that would die for you
I'd give the world, dear, to belong to you
The game is over now, I know I've lost
My broken heart will have to pay the costI know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss you little momma from a-rolling in your arms

I'm going down thr road where I can get more decent care
I'm going down thr road where I can get more decent care
Going back to my used to be rider cause I don't feel welcome here

I know my baby sure is bound to love me aome
I know my baby sure is bound to love me aome
Cause he throws his arms around me like a circle around the sun

I laid down last night trying to take a rest
I laid down last night trying to take a rest
But my mind kept rambling like the wild geese in the West

I'm going down to the river set in my rockin' chair
I'm going down to the river set in my rockin' chair
And if the blues don't find me, gonna rock away from here

Loving you baby just as easy as rolling off a log
Loving you baby just as easy as rolling off a log
But if I can't be your woman, I sure ain't gonna be your dog

I will cut your wood baby I will make your fire
I will cut your wood baby I will make your fire
And I will tote your water, baby, from that Fresno Bar

Sun gonna shine in my back yard some day
Sun gonna shine in my back yard some day
And the wild gonna rise up, baby, blow my blues awayWell, I know what it means to be lonesome
    And I know what it means to be blue
    Well, I know what it means to be lonesome in dreams
    When there is someone there with you

Well my baby left me this morning
As the clock was striking four
The sweet smiling face of my darling
I may never see any more

  

Well I've cried and I've cried since we parted
No one knows what I've been though
You know I'd give all I own just to have you back home
I'm lonesome, lonesome for youIt makes no difference where I wander
No matter what I say or do
I can't out live this memory of you
And I cry dear when I think of you

    Somehow you wouldn't let me love you
    The plans we made have gone astray
    Instead of being blue and lonely
    I just Think I'll go away

It seems we both could have been happy
If things had only truned out right
From now on each day I'll think about you
And I'll dream of you dear every nightWhen you left me you said you'd return dear
You said you would be back some day
Oh please let me hear from you darling
I just can't go on this old way

    I know you never did love me
    But I thought that you would dear someday
    Oh please let me hear from you darling
    I just can't go on this old way

Remember the good times together
When you said that you loved me so true
As I sit here the stars hover o'er me
there's a love in my heart dear for youI've been away for just a year
Have you fortotten me my dear
The judge said I must pay the cost
I never knew how much I lost

    Until they sent me far away
    Where each minute seems a day
    But maybe someday I'll be free
    Will you be waiting there for me

I'm in this cell because of you
The crime I did you drove me to
My jealous heart just could not stand
To see you with another man

  

I hope someday that you will learn
And broken heart you'll return
But listen darling please don't wait
For maybe then will be too lateI hear a choo choo coming
    It's coming down the trak
    It's coming taking mu darling
    Never to bring her back

My darling left me this morning
She left me feeling so blue
I'm going to rock, roll, and ramble
Try to forget all about you

  

Well I know I can't forget her
So I won't ever try
I'll go through life a wondering
Until the day I dieWhile walking one day in the country
I saw a gathering crowd
And as my footsteps drew me closer
I smelled the sweet fragrance of flowers
It looking like a family reunion
Had my eyes not counted the tears
And an old man sat by a graveyard
I haven't seen Mary in years

    Hold to my hand and lead me
    Lead me away from here
    I just brought these flowers for Mary
    I haven't seen Mary in years

When Mary and I were first married
We had such plans for out child
But for no reason I started rambling
And like the four winds I just went wild
If I could live my life over
I would bring Mary such cheer
Now she's gone where she'll never meet me
I haven't seen Mary in years

  

Then the old man left the graveyard
And I walked right by his side
I called his name but through all his shame
His son he did not recognize
Hold to my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
How could I know it was Mama
I haven't seen Mary in yearsOh my dear, I hven't got the right to love you
Deep regrets of yesterday still torture me
I wish I didn't have to face this guilty conscience
Like I do each time I see you secretly

I feel that I am stealing part of heaven
Every time I hold you in my arms this way
Cause I know I haven't got the right to love you
While my heart is bound by vows of yesterday

It will be so hard for us to stay apart dear
And condemn this love thats growing day by day
Though I know I haven't got the right to love you
Can I ever tell my heart that its too late

I'd give the world if only I could hold you
Without feeling guilty of an awful crime
Though I know I haven't got the right to love you
In my heart I can held feeling that your maineYou'll own a part of me my dear forever
Some things you give can never be returned
The flame of love that once burned oh so brightly
Is growing dim and how my poor heart yearns

Maybe it will break into tomorrow
But I'll remember only yesterday
And if my life is filled with pain and sorrow
I guess it's only right that I should payThere you go now, baby, and here am I
Well you left me here so I could sit and cry
Hooey baby how you drove me crazy
Guess it soesn't matter anynmore

Do you remember baby last September
How you help me tight each and every night
Golly gee what have you done to me
Guess it doesn't matter anymore

    There's no use in me a-crying
    And I've done everything
    Now I'm sick of trying
    And I've thrown away my nights
    Wasted all my days over you
	
	You go your way, baby, and I'll go mine
	Now and forever til the end of time
	We'll find somebody new
	Baby we'll say we're through
	You won't matter anymoreIf you're ever gonna love me well, I wanna know it
    There's just one way that you can show it
    If you don't start treatin' me better, you see
    I'm a-gonna do away with me

I'm gonna go down where the water is a little deep
I'm takin' no chance now you see
If you don't start treatin' me a little bit better
I'm a-gonna do away with me

  

Now, won't you tell me how you feel about it
You're runnin' me crazy can't you see
If you don't start treatin' me a little bit better
I'm a-gonna do away with meSoon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Till we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

    If we never meet again this side of heaven
    As we struggle through this world and its strife
    There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
    By the river of life
    Where the charming roses bloom, forever
    And where separation come no more
    If we never meet again this side of heaven
    I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet againI don't blame you for I know you want him
That your love for me was never real
I could hold you but you'd be unhappy
But it's alright if that's the way you feel

    I know that I will always go on caring
    And my feeling now I must conceal
    I still need you and I want you with me
    But it's alright if that's the way you feel

I always knew someday tyhat I would lose you
When those lies about me were revealed
It's plain to see sweetheart you believe them
But it's alright if that's the way you feelIt's true that live you, it's true you're not free
I'm trusting in tomorrow that someday you may be
So I'll go on hoping and trusting in fate
If it takes me a lifetime then I'll just wait

    I'll cherish the say you and I met
    Sweet memories of you, I'll never forget
    You lifted me up when I was down
    And gave me a smile in place of a frown
    I'll always be waiting, it's never too late
    If it takes me a lifetime then I'll just wait

This waiting is awful, but still you are tied
I'm trying my best my feeling to hide
Though people are talking but still must state
If it takes me a lifetime then I'll just waitFor many years I've been a rolling stone, my darling
Like a gypsy I have roamed from place to place
Fortune never came to me
But how happy I would be
Just to look again upon your smilling face

    Now if I should wander back tonight
    Would you be waiting
    Would your eyes be filled with love's own tender light
    Would your arms be empty, dear
    Would you thrill to find me near
    Would you love me if I'd wander back tonight

When buddy flowers lend their fragrance in the springtime
I recall the reses trining round your door
Fancy then I homeward stay
I seem to hear you say
That you love me as you did in days of yore

  

Last night I dreamed that you and I were back togather
I held your hand so gently in my own
Heard you say we'd never part
As I pressed you to my heart
Then I woke in tears to find myself aloneI never thought I'd need you
But now I found I'm wrong
Come on back swee mama
Back where you belong
I've gambled over town
Find that I can't win
Come on back and pick me up again

    Now if I lose (If I lose)
    Let me lose (let me lose)
    I don't care (I don't care)
    How mach I lose
    If I lose a hundred dollars
    While I'm trying to win a dime
    My baby she's got money all the time

Of all the other gals I know
Now can take your place
Cause when I get into a Jam
They just ain't in their place
So now that you're back dear
Let's make another round
With you never by my side
The deal just can't go downThere a little log hut down in old Caroline
All the doors are shut and its covered with vine
Thats where I lived when just a lad
I was happy there with Mother and Dad

    Now I'm alone and oh so lonely
    I know my heart would be so sad
    But if I had my to live over
    I'd dtay at home with Mother and Dad

I left my home down in old Caroline
I rambled round from time to time
I waited too long to start back home
For the ones I loved had done passed on

  

Now I've got no parents no place to call home
I'm out in this world and I'm on my own
My heart is broke, my heart is sad
For I've got no home, no Mother or DadHow sweet and happy seem, those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what repture sweet, my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again

    If I could hear my mother pray again
    If I cluld hear her tender voice as then
    So happy I would be, twould mean so much to me
    If I could hear my mother pray again

She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love, I seek that home above
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day

  

Within the old home place, her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear

  

Her work on earth is done, the life crown has been won
And she will be at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she, I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and loveI'd rather be lonely than be unhappy
    I can't take the life that you lead
    Your wild kind of life is not my way of livin'
    And I'd rather have it this way

You promised to love me and that's all that matters
But now you've broken those vows
Your night life and bright lights were your kind of choosin'
So I'll say goodbye to you nowI'd rather be alone and have you dream of me always
    Than to have you say you're sorry that we are apart
    I'd rather be alone and have you dream of me always
    Than to be in your arms but never in your heart 

I just received your letter and you asked me to come home
You say you're sorry that you went away
This is an old old story I've heard it all before
So darling this is all that I can say

  

I tried so hard my darling to make you love me then
But you would always leave me here alone
Although I could forgive you but things would be the same
And love could never change your heart of stoneI don't want your rambling letters
    Don't want your picture in a frame
    All I want is you in person
    Won't you let me change your name

Mama said you'd come home soon
Papa warned me not to wait
Sister thinks that you still love me
Hurry home right away

  

I'm so tired of long distance kisses
Love by mail is all so cold
I just want you in my arms dear
Then our love just can't grow coldWell I don't nobody, nobody loves me
All they wan't my money, they don't care for me
I want to live single, happy and carefree
I don't love nobody, nobody loves me

One day I went out walking, walking down Johnson street
I met a little old lady, she smiled at me so sweet
Said hello my honey , how are you today
Just as I started to kiss her, these words I heard her say

Lord, I don't love nobody, nobody loves me
All they wants my money , they don't care for me
I want to live single, happy and carefree
I don't love nobody, nobody loves me

Next day I went out walking, walking down Johnson street
I met the same little lady, she was dressed up so near
She smiled at me and said hello, how are you today
Tipped my hat and said hello and journeyed on my way

Cause I don't love nobody, nobody loves me
All they wants my money , they don't care for me
I want to live single, happy and carefree
I don't love nobody, nobody loves meI don't know I love you so
Until the day I left you go
And then the tears began yo flow
I'm sorry dear I didn't know

    And darling if you forgive me
    And listen to my plea
    No matter where you are my dear
    I'll come begging on my knees
    I know we share a broken heart
    Because you loved me from the start
    Oh darling free my toroubred soul
    I'm sorry dear, I didn't know

I didn't care until the day
But now you've gone so far away
I realize I loved you so 
I'm sorry dear, I didn't knowI don't care, I don't care, I don't care
    I don't care what you do anymore
    You played with my heart
    Right from the start
    And I don't care anymore

Now all of my love you denied
You laughed in my face when I cried
You played with my heart
Right from the start
And I don't care anymore

  

I'm easing the load on my mind
I'm leaving the past all behind
I'm starting a new life without you
And I don't care anymoreLast night my dear the day was falling
I went t bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you

I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you

Then we met out in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too

I don't believe you met my baby
You looked at him, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to

I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
I was still wondering to

Your arm was resting on his shoulder
You smiled at him, he smiled at you
His eyes were filled with victory

He said my sister wants to marry
Then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry meOh the worst mistake I could ever make was to take taht pledge and vow
Cause now I'm tied to a nagging wife and always in a row
To scared to talk I'll walk the chalk, my head I'll meekly bow
And I'd like to be sixteen again and know what I know now

    Yea, I'd like to be sixteen again and know what I know now
    The girl please with every squeeze make em holler wow
    But its too late to change my fate such thing is not allowed
    I'd like to be sixteen again and know what I know now

I've spent my youth arunning round well I tought I knew it all
But what I learned it hard mow my head is bald
I reminisce of things I missed of fields I'd liked to plough
But I'd like to be sixteen again and know what I know now

  

My teeth are gone I'm not too strong don't have to much to build
And ever a jug of Geritol won't change the way I feel
I'm like the dog to old to bite all I can do is growl
But I'd like to be sixteen again and know what I know now

  * refrainIda Red, Ida Green
Purtiest gal I ever seen

Ida Red lives in town
Weighs three hundred and forty pounds

Ida Red, Ida Red
I'm just crazy about Ida Red

Ida Red, Ida Blue
Ida bit a hoecake half in two

Ida Red, Ida Red
Everybody's crazy about Ida Red

If I'd a-listend to what Ida said
I'd a-been sleeping in Ida's bedTeardrops fell the night you said
I love you dear and you were wed
I watched you while you held her hand
I turned away and cried again

    I cried again when I reached home
    There set your picture all alone
    I thought of things that might have been
    I bowed my head and cried again

I took your letters from the shelf
And read aloud just to myself
And just before I reached the end
I bowed my head and cried again

  

I thought of love I'd been denied
And how to hold it I hed tried
And of dreams that we had shared
And days gone by when you had cared

  

And heres the reason why I say
I must throw your things away
For they would always bring me pain
And then I'd only cry againI couldn't win because she did not love me
She just pretended as she kissed me then
And then about the time I really loved her
She left me and I knew I couldn't win

I'm thankful for the happiness she gave me
I wish that I could fall in love again
I don't blaime her I guess I'm just unlucky
But from the start I knew I couldn't win

Tonight I sit here drinking in this tavern
And as I order up the drinks again
I see her smiling sweetly at another
If only he just knew that he can't win

A broken heart she must have had in childhood
Now she's afraid it might happen again
She's really not to blame for all my heartaches
But from the start I knew I couldn't winLast night I came home and I knocked at my door
And I called for my love as I oft had before
I called once again but no answer there came
No sweet lips to greet me no voice called my name

    I couldn't believe it was true, oh, Lord
    I couldn't believe it was true
    My eyes filled with tears and I must have aged 10 years
    I couldn't believe it was true

I left myself in and I walked to our bed
I found a note there and a message I read
The truth like a bolt from the blue then the dawn
My sweetheart had left me my darling was gone

  

The shock was so great I am quivering yet
I'll try to forgive her but I cannot forget
My heart breaking loss is another man's gain
Her happiness I hope will always remainCear when I think about you I could cry
Knowing I have let love go by
I'll just stay at home, and always wonder why
Every time I see your picture I could cry

    I could cry an ocean of tears
    But what good would it do
    I'll just keep your memory as years go gy
    But when your name's mentioned darling I could cry

I don't know what this cruel world holds for me
But it really doesn't matter now you see
For when day is done and twilight hovers night
Then I miss your arms around me, I could cryWell I've been a bachelor all my life
I thought the time had come to take a wife
So I moved to the city to find myself a mate
But I get all confused when I start looking for a date

    Oh, I can't tell the boys from the girls
    And friends it's really messing up my world
    They all wear long hair and bouncy curls
    And I can't tell the boys from the girls

I walked in a picture show and found a seat
This pretty little thing sat down in front of me
I leaned over and asked her if she'd like some company
But I rearly died when she truned out to be a he

  

I'm going to leave this city and go home
I guess I'll stay single from now on
But I won't make the same mistake by coming here again
Cause I can't tell difference between the hers and himsI can hear the angels singing
As I walk this rocky road
For my thoughts are all of heaven
And my Savior's blest abode

    Oh, I can hear the angels singing
    I can hear my Savior's voice
    And I'll soon be singing with them
    Though endless ages we'll rejoice

I can hear the angels singing
Of my Savior's blessed love
How he died to build a mansion
For his children up aboveOh you said that you loved me that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me, I'm so blue
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me, I'm so blue

    Our vows have been broken, you have proven untrue
    Another has my sweetherart and a love that I once knew
    I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
    But now you've gone and left me, I'm so blue

Oh the nights are so lonely, dreams of you hold me so
What's happened little darling, I don't know
I believed in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me, I'm so blueI am a mwn of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I did farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised

For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here here on earth I find
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now

It's fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that Northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon, this train

You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave

It's fare you well to a native country 
The places I have loved so well
For I have seen all kinds of trouble
In this cruel world no together can tell

Maybe your friends think I'm a stranger
My face your'll never see no more
But there is one promise trhat is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shoreI'm a going back to the country
I can't pay that rent
No I'm not completely broke
But brother I'm badly bent
I can't understand where my money went
But I ain't broke but I'm badly bent

When I get back to the country
I'll be living in a tent
Ma and Pa will surely be mad
Bout all the money I spent
I can't understand just where itwent
But I ain't broke just badly bent

Well I had a lot of money
But to the city I went
I met too many good locking firls
And that's where my money went
And now I know just where it went
I ain't broke but I'm badly bent

I can't understand where my money went
But I ain't broke but brother I'm badly bentI don't want you crying when I'm leaving
Don't want you cuying when I'm blue
Only my thoughts make me lonesome
Wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too

    How would you like being lonesome
    Someone thats through with you
    My heart is sad and lonesome
    Wonder if you lonesome too
    wonder if you lonesome too

Why should two lovers quarrel
Why should they be so untrue
I know what it mean to be lonesome
Wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too

  

Now give me your arm here honey
I'll say this farewell to you
I'll be so lonesome without you
But you'll be lonesome too
But you'll be lonesome tooYou let me, my darling, to travel alone
My heart is so lonely and blue
When friends ask about you why you're not around
How will explain about you

How will explain about you
They know I've been faithful and true
So when they start asking why you're not around
How will explain about you

They saw us together for such a long time
They knew that I love you so true
But now that you've gone and I'm left all alone
How will explain about you

How will I explain about you
I can't let them know that we're through
They wouldn't believe it could ever be true
How will explain about you

How will explain about you
I'm leaving it all up to you
And if you insist that our pathway must part
How wii explain about youGet down boy, go back home
    Back to the girl you love
    Teat her right, never wrong
    How mountain girls can love

Riding the night in the high cold winds
On the train of the old lonesome pine
Thinking of you, feeling so blue
Wondering why you left me behind

  

Remember the night me strolled down the lane
Our hearts were gay and happy then
You whispered to me as I hold your hand
You hoped the night would never endHave you ever been so lonely so blue you could die
When the one you love no longer cares for you
When you trouble mind keeps bothering you won't leave you alone
When you know its all over love's grown cold

    How lonely, oh, how lonely how lonely can you get
    I'd give this wide world over If we had never met
    I woudn't have these lonely night days of sad regret
    Don't mind being lonely but how lonely can you get

I've tried to tell me my trouble mind to live and just forget
But I don't find that so easy and never will, I guess
I'm locked up in a dream world with dreams and loneliness
And every day I ask myself how lonely can you getIn my memory there's a little mountain homestead
And the flowers are still growing on the lawn
Now each time I go back home, the tears start falling
How I miss my darling since she's gone

    She's gone to join a happy band of angels
    To sing for endless ages at God's throne
    The best friend I ever had, is now with Jesus
    How I miss my darling mother since she's gone

There'll never be another friend like mother
No one can do the things for me she done
No can fill the vacant place she left here
How I miss my darling mother since she's goneI dreamed you were lying close beside me
And I dreamed no one else had your heart
In this dream you said you loved me
And told me that we'd never part

    Oh how could I dream such a dream
    How peaceful there while I sleep
    But I awoke, how strange it did seem
    I was lost in a world so deep

You'll never know just how much I love you
And that you're in my prayers every night
But tonight you're in the arms of another
And I know what I'm felling ain't rightHow come you do me like do do do
    How come you do me like do
    How come you do me like do do do
    When I ain't done nothing to you

Ashese to ashes and it's sand to sand
I'm giving you my warning that
I ain't no monkey man
How come you do me like do do do
How come you do me like do

�@ 

Ashes to ashes and it's dust to dust
Show me a woman that a man can trust
How come you do me like do do do
How come you do me like do

�@We read of a place that's called heaven
It's made for the pure and the free
These truths in God's Word He hath given
How beautiful heaven must be

You'll be sweetest little baby in townThere is a in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
Its been the ruin of many poor girls
And me, oh lord, I'm one

My mother she's a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
My husband he's a gambling man
Drinks down in New Orleans

My husband he's a gambler
He goes from town to town
The only time he's satisfied is when
He drinks his liquor down

Go tell my baby sister
Never do like I have done
Shun that house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun

One foot on the platform
The other's on the train
I'm going down to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm going to spend the rest of my life
Beneath that rising sunEvery minute of the day I'm thinking about you
And without you life is just a crazy dream
Every breath I take I'm hoping that you're hoping
That I'm hoping you'll return to me

Can you remember dear when you said
If I ever stopped loving you, you'd rather be dead
Well dear, I don't know what on earth changed you mind
No matter whose holding you, your heart is still mine

Every time I think about the way you cuddled up and spuddled up
And thrilled me with your charm
I get dizzy in the head and when it's seeming that I'm dreaming
I'm locked in your loving armsHot corn, cold corn, bring along a demijohn
    Hot corn, cold corn, bring along a demijohn
    Hot corn, cold corn, bring along a demijohn
    Fare thee well, Uncle Bill, see you in the morning, Yes sir

Upstairs, downstairs, down in the Kitchen
Upstairs, downstairs, down in the Kitchen
Upstairs, downstairs, down in the Kitchen
See Uncle Bill, see you fill 'em up again, Yes sir

  

Old Aunt Peggy won't you fill 'em up again
Old Aunt Peggy won't you fill 'em up again
Old Aunt Peggy won't you fill 'em up again
Ain't had a drink since I don't know when, Yes sir

  

Yonder comes the preacher and the children are a-crying
Yonder comes the preacher and the children are a-crying
Yonder comes the preacher and the children are a-crying
Chickens are a-hollering, toenails a-flying, Yes sirWhen I look back, boy I must have been green
Boppin' in the country fishin' in the stream
Lookin' for an answer tryin' to find a sign
Tell us all you city litghts honey I was blind
They said

 *  Get back Honky cat better get back to the woods
    Well I quit those days and my red neck away and
    Oh, this is gonna do me good

Well I read some books and I read some magazines
I know high class babies down in New Orleans
All the folks back home said I was a fool
They said believen' the Lord is the golden rule
You better

 ** Get back honky cat livin' in the city ain't where it's at
	It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver linin'
	It's like drivin' whisky home for a bottle of wine
They said
Stay at home boy you gotta chance the fun
Livin' in the city boy is gonna break your heart
How can you stay when your heart says no how can you stop
When your feet say go

	
   *When I was young I couldn't see
How much the old town had meant to me
But it's too late to mourn and cry
As long as I live this old town will never die

    It ain't fair in our home town
    When people tear our buildings down
    This old town won't be the same
    Seems as tho it's an awful shame

The family church house is torn down too
And we've all been wondering what will we do
To find another would be kinda hard
But we will all cherish pleasant memories serving GodThe ol' home town is sure in trouble
It's looks like it must have doubled
It's city-size since I been gone
The Neighbors all are full of killing
Two million people willing
To die for something they've never known
The city streets of drunks junk and stone
A heaven made in hell they call their home

    Now it's gone like the life of a child
    When it turn its back on your mind
    Tommorrow has no home sweet home
    Look what they've done to mind
    It's just faded into time

Grandfather's watch he gave me
Is just another memory
I have kept the way it always was
And ever since he died, it just wont run
I always knew I was his favorite one

  

And that old house we used to live in
The root is falling in
Like every other one along the Hook
It took 20 years to pay and 10 to rot
That's says it's all just a better off forgotAll the neon lights were flashin' and the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes and the drizzel turned to snow
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead and the wine was runnin' low
Then the old man came home from the forest

His tears fell on the sidewalk as he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare but no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway and a bottle his only friend
And the old man stumbled in from the forest

Up a dark and dingy staircase the old man made his way
His ragged coat around him as upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened that he ended up this way
Gettin' lost like a fool in the forest

And as he lay there sleepin' a vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining the face of one so dear
Who'd loved him in the springtime of a long forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom in the forest

She touched his grizzled fingers and she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside in some forgotten town
Where the river runs down from the forest

With a mighty roar the big jets soar above the canyon streets
And the commen con but life goes on for the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotton soldier the dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home from the forestHold whatcha got, I'm a-coming home baby
    Hold whatcha got, and I don't mean maybe
    Been a-thinking about you
    And I'm on my way
    Don't sell the house, don't wreck the car
    Stay there, honey, right where you are
    If you hold whatcha got, I'm coming home to stay

Well in my mind I can see you
That's a mighty good sigh that I need you
That's why I can't wait to get back home
So squeeze yourself real good and tight
And I'll be home before daylight
If you hold whatcha got, I'm coming home to stay

  

Well when I get back, honey, I ain't leaving
I been too lonel, little too much grieveng
When I get back,honey, this time I'm gonna stay
Well we won't fuss and we won't fight
And this time things is gonna be all right
If you hold whatcha got, I'm a-coming home to stayTime is filled with swift transition
Naught of earth unmoved can stand
Build you hopes on things eternal
Hold to God's unchanging hand

    Hold to God's unchanging hand
    Hold to God's unchanging hand
    Build you hopes on things eternal
    Hold to God's unchanging hand

Trust in Him who will not leave you
What so ever years may bring
If by earthly friends forsaken
Still, more closely to Him cling

  

Covet not this world's vain riches
That so rapidly decay
Seek to gain the heavenly treasures
They will never pass away

  

When your journey is completed
When the valley you pass thru
Fair and bright the home in glory
Your enraptured soul will viewKneel down by the side of your mother, my boy
You have only a moment I know
But stay till I give you this parting addvice
It is all that I have to be stow

    Hold fast to the right, hold fast to the right
    Wherever your footsteps may roam
    Oh forsake not the way of a salvation my boy
    That you learn'd from your mother at home

You leave us to seek your meployment, my boy
By the world you have yet to be tried
But in the temptations and trials you meet
May your heart to the Savior confide

 

I gave you to God in your cradle, my boy
And I've taught you the best that I knew
And as long as His mercies permit me to live
And I shall never cease praying  for you

 

You will find in your satchel, a Bible, my boy
It's the book of all others the best
It will help you to leve and prepare you to die
And will lead to the gates of the blestGot a hole in my pocket done packed my ole nap-sack
Got a train to catch a mile on down the track
Been hanging 'round this ole town way to many days
Got to ramble on I must be on my way

    Bot the hobo blues
    Got to go, got to go, Bod I've got the hobo blues
    When I hear that whistle blow
    Got to move, got to move
    God, I've got the hobe blues

Some women try to hold me but I keep moving on
My hat don't hang no where for to long
Cause I'm caught up in the feeling of a singing breakman's song
Got the hobo blues deep down in my bones

 

When I die say you'll bury me in an old box-car
With a coffee can and my ole guitar
And make sure I'm close enough to hear the passing trains
Got that freight-tarin fever chugging in my veinsRiding on an east bound freight train, speeding thru the night
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold

No warm lights flicker 'round him, no blankets there to fold
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing, in a dreary kind of way
The hobo seemed contented, for he smiled there where he lay

Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcare door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped thru the darkness, and the raging storm outside
No-one knew that Hobe Bill was taking his last ride

It was early in the morning when they raised the Hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother's longing, to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum, who died out in the coldApples in the summer time
Peaches in the fall
If I don't get the girl I love
Won't hae none at all

    Going to Rocky Island
    Going when I'm gone
    See my Candy darling
    Ho honey ho

    Then I'll know I'm number one on the lover's hit parade

Well I let you for a half of beer 'cos it's so nice and fine
Another one to take your place would sure be hard to find
So put your arms around me dear and be my turtle dove
And then I'll know I'm number one on your hit parade of loveHigh on a mountain wind blowing free
    Thinking about the days that used to be
    Yes, high up on that mountain standing all alone
    Wondering where the years of my life had flown

As I looked at the valleys down below
Just as far as I could see my memories returned
Oh how my heart did yearn for you
And the days that used to be

 

Oh I wonder if you ever think of me
Or if time has blotted out your memory
As I listen to the breeze whisper gently through the trees
I shall always cherish what you meant to meHigh on a hilltop overlooking a city
I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you're dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gfay life takes the place of our dream

    High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
    Forgive her she know not the way
    And give me the power to believe and some day
    High on a hilltop together we'll pray

I can vision a rounder with a life so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you're silly with booze
And high on a hilltop I see a devil win youIn the beautiful hills, way back in Roan Country
There's where I roamed for many long years
There's where my heart's been tending most ever
That's where the first step of misfortune I made

I was thirty years old when I courted and married
When Armanda Gilbreath was then called my wife
Her brother stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three months later I'd taken Tom's life

For twenty five years this whole world I rambled
I went to old England to France and to Spain
And I thought of my home way back in Roan Country
I boarded a steamer and came back again

I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in the country would speak a kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next morning
A lifetime in prison was the word that I heard

When the train pulled out, poor mother stood weepin
And sister she sat, alone with a sing
And the last words I heard was, Willie God bless you
Was Will God bless you, God bless you, good bye

Sweet Martha was buried but corey was better
There's better and worse, although you can see
Boys when you write home form the prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for mewell moma said " Son before you go
There's something I want you to do
Promise me that you won't go wrong
As you travel down Highway 52 "

I am sittling on the banks of the Ohio river
Sun rise kisses the dew
Fox hounds run and the steam boat roll
I'm sitting there on highway 52

    High in the hills old West Virginia
    Kentucky painted so blue
    My road maps out, my shoes are made for walking
    I'll be walking down old highway 52

From the old Queen City to New Boston town
Ironton and old Hanging rock
I've made ever stop, I've played every station
While travelin' there on Highway 52

So tell me my love, oh tell me my darlin'
What are you going to do
If you don't love me or care about me
I'll be headin' on down highway 52

 

You when it comes time for me to go
I'll hang up my old walkin' shoes
For the last old ride in that big white car
As they haul me down old highway 52I once had a darlin' wife and true and sweet
Life was so bright and gay everything complete
Then I fell for another who led my life astray
Now I'll live in sorrow till my dying day

    Down the highway of sorrow I'm travelin' alone
    I've lost all my true friends I've lost a happy home
    I'm headed for destruction I'm on the wrong track
    Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back

Then I went back to my darling and I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear dimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
Now I'll live in sorrow as I live

  

  
    Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning backAin't talking, just walking
    Down that highway of regret
    Heart's buring, still yearning
    For the best girl this poor boy's ever met

I never thought this thing could happen
I never thought you'd be untrue
Or go away with another
And break a heart that worshipped you

  

It makes no difference where I wonder
You never seem to leave my mind
Your face is always there before me
I think about you all the timeHey lonesome who broke your heart into
Hey lonesome who left you with the blues

I never will forget the day
That you threw my dreams away
When I told you there'd come a day
For all your wrongs to end you'd pay

Hey lonesome who does it feel to lose
Hey lonesome who left you with the blues

You didn't care what I went through
you left me here to cry
you knew my love for you was true
But still you said good bye

Hey lonesome you're gonna wear out your shoes
Hey lonesome who left you with the blues

I tried to tell you when you left
That you'd be back someday
But I've done found me some one else
And here is all I've got to say

Hey lonesome who broke your heart into
Hey lonesome who left you with the bluesI saw you last night in my dream love
I woke as the clock was striking four
But I didn't think that I'd meet you
And now as you walk thruogh the door

    Come set here with me little darling
    And allow me to say
    I love you sweet heart, I love you
    Hey hey hey hey

As you stood there before me I wondered
If I'd every get you off my mind
And the tears filled my eyes when you vanished
With your golden curls that hung down behind

 

Won't you come back to me in my dream love
Some dark night when I'm here all alone
Would you tell me sweet heart that you love me
Some dark night when I'm here all alone'Twas on an autumn evening, an old man bent with age
He landed in a city from off of the dusty sage
Is this the express office sir ? I've come to meet my son
They told me that the train was due at this place at half past one

You've made a slight mistake, sir, I'd like for you to know
This is the express office, and not the town deport
You do not understand me, sir, with trembling lips his said
He's not coming to me as a passenger, but he's coming to me dead

Just then a whistle pierced the air, "the express", some one cried
And with a feeble tremblijhng step, the old man passed outside
Just then a casket in a box was lowered to the ground
It was an eager, anxious crowd that quickly gathered 'round

Don't handle it so roughly boys, for that's our darling Jack
He left us just as you are now, Look how he's coming back
It's broken his poor mother's heart as partings always do
Think God he died a hero's death while with the boys in blueHere today and gone tomorrow
Our love would always be a hidden love affair
I know you love me but you're just a wandering
Today I love you but tomorrow I may not care

    For absence never makes the heart grow fonder
    I get lonesome for some one's company
    Here today and gone tomorrow
    And my loving you is just fantasy

When you're gone I wished we'd never met
For your memory remains within my heart
Here today and gone tomorrow
We can't be happy so I think it's best we partI said I'd never do it again
I swore my ways I would mend
But you cheated, dear, and thats a sin
Here I am I'm drunk again

    I'm drunk because you are gone
    At the bar I'm standing all alone
    Drowning my sorrow deep within
    Here I am I'm drunk again

I don't like this life of mine
Drunking whisky, beer and wine
Dear I know this is the end
Here I am I'm drunk againThirty days now I've been gone out here in this world alone
But I can hear her sweet love's calling me
We're a thousand miles apart but she's here in my heart
Cause I can hear her sweet love's calling me

    Oh, her sweet love's calling me
    And her lonely arms keep reaching for someone that she needs
    Oh, the teardcrops are falling on my cheeks
    Cause I can hear her sweet love's calling me

I remember how she cried the day I said good-bye
Now I can hear her sweet love's callling me
I don't know why I ever roamed leaving love like her's at home
But I can hear her sweet love's calling meThinking of you while out for a ramble
Down by a cold frosty stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
Gentry I fell into a dream

I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty I'd never saw before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So gree was the mantel she wore

He hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was as ivory so white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Of stars than shine on a cold frosty night

I drew her near then I awakened
With two empty arms and you on my mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to know you left me behindLet not your heart be troubled for he will take you in
His invitation stand forevermore
He's right there where you let him to take you by the hand
And lead you to that everlasting shore

    He'll take you in
    He'll take you in and give you shelter from the storm
    He'll take you in
    He'll take you in and there your mortal life transform
    How can you be so down and out, you should jump right up and shout
    He'll take you in
    He'll take you in
    He'll take you in

Let not your soul be weary for he will strengthen you
Even in the weakest times you'll find
Him reaching out his arms to lift you up again
You know he'll take you in every time

 

You'll be walking on the water with your feet on hallowed ground
If you have the faith to follow in his will
You'll be one with the spirit the father and the son
He'll deliver you sanctified and sealedNow hello stranger put your lovin' hand in mine
Hello stranger put your lovin' hand in mine
You are a stranger
But you're a pal of mine

Now get up rounder let a workin' may lay down
Get up rounder let a workin' man lay down
You are a rounder
But you're all out and down

Every time I ride that six and four street car
Every time I ride that six and four street car
I can see my baby
Peepin' through the bars

She bowed her head she waved both hands at me
She bowed her head she waved both hands at me
I'm prison bound
I'm longing to be free

Oh I see you when your troubles are like mine
Oh I see you when your ttoubles are like mine
Oh I see you
When you haven't got a dime

Weepin' like a willow and moanin' like a dove
Weepin' like a willow and moanin' like a dove
there's a girl of the country
That I really loveHello, Mary Lou, good-bye night
    Sweet, Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
    I know, Mary Lou, we never part
    So hello, mary lou, good-bye heart

Passed me by one sunny day
Frashed those gib broun eyes my way
I know I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

  

I saw your lips,I heard your voice
Bleave me, I just had no choice
Wild horsed couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlight night
Arms around you good and tite
That's all I had to see for me to sayHello, city limits, I see your sign
    Left all my worries way behind
    Left all my troubles and heartaches there too
    Hello, city limits, I'm starting out brand new

I need a change of scenety, I need it real bad
To help me forget all the fard times I've had
I've got a feeling I'll find a love that's true
Well, hello city limits, I'm starting out brand new

  

I haven't told a soul just where I'm gonna be
Cause I don't want the blue to catch up with me
I may decide to cange my name too
Hello city limits, I'm starting out brand newHelen the night I met you
It seemed that my heart went your way
Love was the word that told the story
I wish you were here with me today

    You told me that I need not worry
    That you would always be mine
    Helen my darling please tell me
    A place in your heart I'll always find

Helen my darling I love you
I love you with all of my heart
Darling don't ever forsake me
Say that we never will part

  

The time we are wastin' my darling
Is making my heart ache with pain
But our lives are so far apart dear
I guess I'm just hoping in vainOn Saturday night when our work is done
We load our music up on the run

    Heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
    We got to ramble and ramble there's heavy traffic ahead

We pull out of Nashville right on time
The Bluebird special headed down the line

  

We travelled around from state to state
The Bluegrass boys are never late

  

Late in the evening about sundown
You know we've come from some other town

  

We do our work with a good will
On Friday night we head for NashvilleSome have mothers who are gone are gone
Some have mothers who are gone are gone
Way up yonder in that new bright world
That heaven light is shining on me

    Oh, that heaven light shining yes its shining on me
    Oh, that heaven light shining yes its shining on me
    Way up yonder in that new bright world
    That heaven light is shining on me

Some have fathers who are gone are gone
Some have fathers who are gone are gone
Way up yonder in that new bright world
That heaven light is shining on me

  

Some have children who are gone are gone
Some have children who are gone are gone
Way up yonder in that new bright world
That heaven light is shining on meIn childhood I heard of a heaven
I wondered if it could be true
That there were sweet mansions eternal
Somewhere up there beyond the blue
I wondered if people really go there
Then one day sweet Jesus came in
And I had a vision of heaven
My soul through all heaven I'll spend

    Heaven (happy home above)
    Heaven (land of peace and love)
    Oh, it makes me feel like traveling on
    Heaven (supernal), Heaven (eternal)
    I'm so glad it's real

Then I got a vision of heaven
My soul overflowing with love
My heart like the Savior's is broken
For friends that will miss that home above
Then a voice from the hills of Judea
Still ringing words of sweet belief
Worlds of attraction don't thrill me
My soul has a change of reliefLord, you ought to been uptown
And seen that train come down
You could hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You could hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Oh, I'm walking these ties
With tears in my eyes
I'm trying to read a letter from home
From my home, from my home
From my home, from my home
I'm trying to read a letter from my home

If this train runs right
I'll be home Saturday night
I'm five fundred miles away from my home
Away from home, away from home
Away from home, away from home
I'm five fundred miles away from home
You could hear the whistle blow a hundred milesHave you ever been to the head or the holler
That's where the big dogs romp and waller
The women there are long and lean 
And some I fear are apt to be mean

    Roll on, head out
    You'll like it there's no doubt
    There ain't no better place to be
    Than the head of the holler in Kentucky

The first time I went to the head of the holler
I wore a bow tie and a snow white collar
When daylight came, come crawlin' in
And the best thing I wore was a silly grin

  

The next time I went to the head of the holler
I saw more moon that I culd swaller
I flew like a bird and a tryin to sing
Till I fell from a tree ane broke one wing

  

Now my gal lives in the head of the holler
Her love shines like a silver dollar
She feeds me butter staight from the churn
And her maw and paw don't give a durn

  

I'm a going back to the head of the holler
You can go too if you want to follow
But don't you fool with that gal of mine
I'll cut you down like a lonesome pineI walked into a church one day
While traveling on my way
I gave my heart to Jesus then
He's coming back to earth again

    He's coming back to earth again
    To claim his children here
    And if we will abide in him
    He'll take us home where there's no fear

My path seems brighter as I go
And I want the world to know
His precious blood your soul will cleanse
He's coming back to earth again

  

Dear friend's I'm singing every day
Take this straight and narrow way
Let Jesus in turn from your sin
He's coming back to earth again

  *RefrainThere's a call that rings from the throne
It springs to those have gone astray, saying
Come ye men and your load of sin
There at the altar lay
You don't seem to heed for the chain of greet
Still crushes your desire
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire

    If you don't from sin retire
    He will set your fields on fire
    You have heard Jesus call
    And in death your soul must fall
    But my friend if you desire
    You may join the Heavenly choir
    And rejoice with Him free from every sin
    When He sets this world on fire

You have heard His voice, seen the sould rejoice
That trusted in His grace
You have blushed with sin as He knocked within
But still you hide your face
From the blessed lord and His own true word
But still you say retire
Leave the downward path, kindle not his wrath
Or He'll set your fields on fire

  

Take a friend's advice, make the sacrifice
Completely turn from sin
Taking up the cross, counting earth as sross
Let Jesus live wihtin
When temptations come keep on facing home
To Satan never hire
But rejoice and pray on the last great day
When He sets this world on fireUpon a rugged cross of Calvary
Was there my blessed Saviour cried
Forgive them for they know not what they do
Oh, sinner friend, for thee he died

His hands are gently knocking on your door
Outside he's pleading to come in
His heart is breaking as he waits for you
To wash you free from every sin

Someday he's coming back to claim his own
We'll fly to Heaven's golden shore
A crown of life he gives on that glad day
With him we'll live forever more

Those cruel thorns they pierced my Saviour's head
The blood was flowing down his face
In shame, forsaken there he hung and died
Oh, sinner freind, he took you place

Oh, sinner freind, he took you placeHave you someone in heaven a'waiting
    Expecting you on that beautiful shore
    Be ready to join that great band of angels
    Where they welcome you into that heavenly door

Come sinners take heed while Jesus is bleeding
Please never be caught in the pathway of sin
For jesus may call you name in the morning
When heaven's gates open will you enter in

  

The vision will hear the prayer of the sinner
No matter how dark no matter how late
He'll welcome you home to the heavenly mansion
Take a straight narrow way to that beautiful gateOh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
They say a strange girl has betrayed me
And that he cares no more for me

Don't you remember the day last summer
The sun so warm the skies so blue
The little birds did sing so sweetly
The day I feel in love with you

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And so he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark falls on the mountain
When all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down by the fair bright waters
And there I'll set me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish that I were some swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
There join those little birds in their crying
Remembering you and your dear face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to meHave I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you onece again aomehow
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I abore you
Well, Darling, I'm telling you now

This heart would break in two if you refuse me
I'm no good without you anyhow
This world would end today if I should lose you
Oh, Darling, I'm telling you now

Have I told you lately that I love you
When the stars are shining in the sky
Have I told you how the nights are long when I'm not with you
Oh, Darling, I'm telling you nowThere's a rabbit in the log and I ain't got my dog
How will I get him I know
I'll get me a briar and twist it in his hair
That way I'll get him, I know
I know ( yes, I know )
I know ( I surely know )
That's how I'll get him I know
I'll get me a briar and twist in his hair
That way I'll get him, I know

I'll build me a fire and I'll cook that old here
Roll him in the flames and make him brown
Have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
And find me a place to lie down
To lie down ( to lie down )
To lay down ( to lay down )
Find me a place to lie down
Have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
And find me a place to lie down

I'm going down the track and my coat ripped up my back
Soles on my shoes are nearly gone
A little ways ahead there's an old farmer's shed
That's where I'll rest my weary bones
Weary bones ( weary bones )
Lazy bones ( lazy bones )
That's where I'll rest my weary bones
A little way's ahead there's an old farmer's ahed
That's where I'll rest my weary bonesFirst time I seen my true love
He was walkin' by my door
The last time I saw
His false hearted smile
Dead on his coolin' board

    It's hard and it's hard ain't it hard
    To love one that never did love you
    Hard and it's hard ain't it hard, great God
    To love one that never will be true

There is a house in this old town
That's where my true love lays around 
Takes other women right down on his knee
Tells them a tale that he won't tell me

  

Don't go to drinkin' and to gambling
Don't go there your sorrows to down
This hard-liquor place is a low-down disgrace
The meanest damn place in this townI've been doing some hard travering, I thought you knowed
I've been doing some hard travering, way down the road
I've been doing some hard travering, hard drinking , hard gambling
I've been doing some hard travering, lord

I've been doing some hard rock mining, I thought you knowed
I've been leaning on a pressure drill, way down the road
Well, the hammer flying and the air hose sucking
And six feet of mud and I sure been a uncking
And I've been doing some hard travering lord

I've been riding them fast passengers, I thought you knowed
I've been hitting them flat wheelers, way down the road
I've been ridin' them blind passengers, dead enders, kickin' up cinders
I've been doing some hard travering, lord

I've been layin' in a hard rock jail, I thought you knowed
I've been layin' out ninety days, way down the road
Darned old judge he said to me, it's ninety days, for vagrancy
And I've been doing some hard travering, lord

I've been doing some hard harvesting, I thought you knowed
From North Dakota to Kansas City, way down the road
Cutting that wheat and stacking that hay trying to make a dollar a day
And I've been doing some hard travering, load

I've been walking that lincoln highway, I thought you knowed
I've been hitchin' on sixty six, way down the road
Got a heavy load, got a worried mind looking for a woman that's hear n fined
And I've been doing some hard travering, lordOh darling I can't stay here
Oh darling I can't stay here
For there's nothing here but a hard rocking chair
Oh darling I can't stay here

I wish I had her tied to my side
I wish I had her tied to my side
If I had her by my side, we'd run away and hide
I wish I had her tied to my side

I wish I was a birdie in the spring
I wish I was a birdie in the spring
Like a birdie in the spring, I could hear my darling sing
I wish I was a birdie in the spring

So darling you know you done me wrong
So darling you know you done me wrong
You done me wrong, I'm leaving you this song
So darling you know you done me wrong

I wish I was a little turtle dove
I wish I was a little turtle dove
Like a little turtle dove, I'd fly to the one I love
I wish I was a little turtle doveIt's a shame I fell in love with a knocked out beauty queen
She's hard to hold for a simple man like me
When it comes her cocktail hour it's my Miller time
I can't come up to her lifestyle and she can't come down to mine

    She's hard on my heart but easy on my eyes
    She cast a spell I'm in heaven's hell lord, I'm hypotized
    I'm just like a sparrow flying where the eagles fly
    She's hard on my heart but easy on my eyes

Her long blonde hair keeps flowing like a river wide
Sometime it's hard to stay afloat and ride
But when I put my arms around her, she makes it all worth while
She tames my restless spirit at the same time, she drives me wildHard hearted, heart broaken
    Dream stealer, love faker
    Hard hearted, heart broaken
    How many hearts have you broken today

How many hearts have you broken today
How many tears have been shed over you
How many hearts have you caused to go wrong
All because your heart has proven untrue

  

How many lies have you told other guess
Just like the ones you told to me
Someday you'll learn that the times will have to turn
Just keep on breaking headstand you will seeOh does your conscience ever bother you
Everytime you hear my name
Oh try to think of all that I've gtone through
And hang your head in shame

    Some one came along and took my place
    Then you gave me all the blame
    Oh you should go somewhere and hide your face
    Then hang your head in shame

Now when you said I was the only one
Was it just your little game
Try to think of all the harm you've done
And hang your head in shame

 

I should hate you but I love you still
In my heart I've kept the flame
Now you'll be sorry darlin' yes you will
Then hang your head in shamePercy Wilson Gay left his wife one day
Then she'd always says'be home on time'
Don't have me a-waitin' here when dinner time comes near
Be here when we set down to dine

He promised her he would, then he swore he'd be good
Percy never could quite settle down
For when his work was thru he'd find a friend or two
They would just play around the town

He called her on the telephone
This is what he'd sing to her alone
Hang out the front door key love
Hang out the front door key

Don't wait up for me love I may be out 'til three
I'm with a very sick friend love who'd do the same for me
So leave a light in hte fall tonight
And hang out the front door key

One nigtht when he got home he found himself alone
Where she had gone he knew not where
Although it served him right he had an awful fright
To think he could not find her there

She called him up and three said'yes dear this is me'
How does it seem to be at home all alone
I'm with some freinds of mine, having so good a time
I don't know just when I'll be home

On the table he found a little note
He poened it and this is what it wrote
Hang out the front door key love
Hang out the front door key

Set upb awhile for me love just as I have for thee
I'm with a very sick friend love who thinks a lot of me
Your little wife's gonna like night life
So hang out the front door keyWell I wish was in London
Or some other seaport town
Set my foot in a steamboat
Sall the Ocean Round

    Saling round the ocean
    Sailin' round the sea
    I think of Handsome Molly
    Wherever she may be

Well I saw her at church last Sunday
She passed me on by
I knew her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye

  

Now do you remember Molly
When you give me your right hand
Said if you ever married
That I would be the manHunt up the matting, whistle up the dog
Hunt up the matting, whistle up the dog
Going to the new ground to get a groundhog
Groundhog, groundhog, groundhog, groundhog

I dug down and it wasn't very deep
I dug down and it wasn't very deep
There laid a whistle-pig sound asleep
Groundhog, groundhog, groundhog, groundhog

I took me a pole and I twist him out
I took me a pole and I twist him out
Good gracious alive, ain't a groundhog stout !
Groundhog, groundhog, groundhog, groundhog

I took him home and I tanned his hide
I took him home and I tanned his hide
He made the best shoe-strings ever was tied
Groudhog, groundhog, groundhog, groundhog

I cut him up and put him on to bile
I cut him up and put him on to bile
Good gracious alive, you could smell him for a mile
Groundhog, groundhog, groundhog, groundhogCome and listen to my story if you will I'm gonna tell
About a gang of feears from down at Nashville
First I'll start with old Red Foley doing his Chatanooga shoe
We can't forget Hank Williams with his good lod Lovesick blues

It's time for Roy Acuff go to Memphis on his train
Minnie Pearl and Rob Brassfield with Lazy Jim Day
Turn on your radio I know that you will wait
Hear Little Jimmy Dickens sing 'Take an old cold rater and wait'

    There'll be guitars and fiddles and banjo picken' too
    Bill Monroe singing out them old Kentucky blues
    Ernest Tubb's number two wrongs won't make a right
    At the Ground ole opry every saturday night

there is Uncle Dave Macon, his gold tooth and plug hat
Cowboy Copas singing tragtic romance
Signed, Sealed and Delivered with Sam and curt mcGee
And the master of ceremony is the Mr.George D. Hay

There is Lonzo and Oscar a-poppin' bubble gum
George Morgan singing candy kisses yum yum
Got a hole in my bucket bringing in that Georgia mail
We'll play the bluegrass breakdown and  dance to the chicken Reel

 

You can talk about your singers in all kinds of way
But none could sing the old songs like Bradley Kincaid
With his old hound dog Buitar and the famous 'Blue tail fly'
Stringbean and Hank Snow and fiddlin' Chubby WiseTrouble and trials often betray
Those all in the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still water
With the good shepherd leading the way

    Going up home to live in green pastures
    Where we shall live and die never more
    Even the lord will be in the number
    When we have reached that heavenly shore

Those who have strayed were sought by the master
He who once gave his lift for the seep
Out on the mountain still he is seaching
Bringing them in forever to keep

  

We will not heed the voice of a stranger
For he will lead us all to despair
Following on with Jesuse our savior
We shall all reach that country so farIn once had a sweetheart but now I have none
The way he has done me I care not for one
The way he has done me contented I'll be
For he loves another much better than me

    Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
    I'm lonesome for my darling since parting from you
    The next time I meet him I hope to prove true
    And change the green lilacs to red, white and blue

I passed by his window both early and late
The look that he gave me it made my heart ache
The look that he gave me was harmful to see
For he loves another much better than me

 

Wrote him a letter with rosey red lines
He sent me an answer all twisted entrines
Keep your love letters and I'll keep mine
Write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mineGreat grand-dad when the land was young
Barred the door with a wagon tongue
For the times was rough, and the redskins mocked
He said his prayers with a shot-gun cocked

He was a citizen tough and grim
Danger was duck soup to him
He ate corn pone and bacon fat
Great grandson would starve on that

Great grand-dad was a busy man
Cooked his grub in a fryin' pan
He picked his teeth with a hunting knife
And he wore the same suit all his life

Twenty-one children came to bless
The old man's home in the wilderness
Doubt this statement if you can
Great grand dad was a busy man

Twenty-one boys and how they grew
Tall and strang on the bacon too
Slept on the floor with the dogs and cats
And hunted in the woods in their coon-skin caps

Twenty-one boys and not one bad
They never got fresh with their great grand-dad
For if they had, he'd have been right glad
To tan their hides with a hickory gad

He raised them rough but he raised them well
When their feet took hold on the road to hell
He straightened them out with an iron ramrod
And filled them full of the fear of God

They grew strong in heart and hand
Firm foundation of our land
Twenty-one boys and a great grand-son
He's a terrible time with that oneI came down from Kentucky, a place called Greasy Creek
That cornbread and buttermilk was all I had to eat
I have served my country, work for Uncle Sam
But cornbread and buttermilk made me what I am

    Oh give me that cornbread and buttermilk, a country boy's delight
    I eat it every morning and I eat it every night
    Some people like friend chicken, others like their ham
    But cornbread and buttermilk made me what I am

My daddy raised some 'taters beans and cabbage too
He always raised plenty of corn to make his mountain dew
Daddy had some horses and cattle on the farm
But cornbread and buttermilk never did no harmThere's grave in the bend of the valley
    Here the shadows sweep over so still
    Here my darling is sleeping so peaceful
    In a gave at the foot of the hill

On the night when I'm lonely and thinking
Of my sweet heart who is now gone away
I go back to the place where she's sleeping
I'm just waiting to see her some day

 

God gave us the joy that we wished for
Just a few days together we'll be
Then he carried her to Heaven's bright portal
There where she will be waiting for me

 

For I often go back to the valley
Where the willows weep over her head
There to be just once more with my darling
By her side tho' I know she is deadlooking through old memories in my cedar closet stashed away
I found the old mendolin grandpa used to play
I picked it up and held it close thinking bout those years ago
And all the great music grandpa made

Weathered worn but never frail with calloused hands he gently played
To bring an easy feeling to a hard working day
When times were tough as they could be he never once complained to me
He'd just let the music sothe the pain

    When grandpa played the mandolin the family gathered 'round
    To sing the olod time songs generations handed down
    I remember every single phrase from every song he played
    Wish I could sing a song with grandpa today

I recall 1961 the year grandpa passed away
The family gathered 'round once more to sing Amazing Grace
Now this mandolin's reminding me of what my grandpa tought to me
That music makes the world a better placeI've laid around and played around this old town too long
    Summers almost gone, winters coming on
    I've laid around and played around this old town too long
    And I feel like I've gotta travel on

Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home, no, Johnny can't come home
Poppa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Cause he's been on this chain gang too long

  

High sherill and police riding after me
Riding after me, yes, coming after me
High sherill and police riding after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on 

  

What to see my honey, want to see her bad
Want to see her bad, oh, want to see her bad
What to see my honey, want to see her bad
She's the best ga  this poor boy ever hadWhen whippoorwill are calling
Night is gently falling
That when I miss you most
When I'm feeling lonely
Thinking of you only
That's when I miss you most

    I'm deep in meditation
    Searchin all creation
    For the one that's so divine
    I'll miss you when its day light
    I'll miss you when its midnight
    Gosh I miss you all the time

When church bells are ringing
Nightingales are singing
Thats when I'll miss you most
When I'm feeling lonely
Thinking of you only
Thats when I'll miss you most

  

When old friends get together
In any kind of weather
I feel like I'm left behind
I miss your arms a stealing
Around me so appearling
Gosh, I miss you all the timeI was a rover on lande and on sea
Till a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning it was so imcomplate
Till a good woman's love put me back n my feet

Still I hope when I go home in the evening
And she'd waiting there
And I know that no matter what happen
She'll always care
Snd when the night come and the moonshine above
I'm a man with the dream and a good woman's loveI peddled my papers for five long years
The news of the day was my worry and care
With worry and tears till I felt I was through
When a sweet voice whispered, Good morning to you

She smiled at me sweetly and bid me good day
Then she left me happy my heart in a daze
I wondered if angels could be so true
As the one who had said, Good morning to you

I went back to my papers next morning st five
My heart in a flutter no sleep in my eye
But my hopes took a tumble, me heart lost its pride
When she came into view, a gent by her side

The nearer she came the madder I got
I swore I would kill him right there on the spot
But I lost all my anger and felt like a cad
When she presented her charming old dad

Then I went over to her fell on my knees
But stars, dots, and dashes were all I could see
I tried to propose like other men do
But all could say was, Good morning to you

She smailed at me sweetly and gave me her hand
Said, Come on my darling for I understand
Instead of me answering the parson I do
I popped up and said, Good morning to youIt was long about a round up time in Texas away out west
I lost a friend, a pal, boys, I laid him down to rest
I weeped and mourned over his grave, to me boys it was sad
Cause I knew down down beneath that mound lay the best pal ever had

My best pal was my old pinto horse and now he's gone to rest
I laid him down beneath that mound in Texas away out west
Well the cactus blooms before his grave and the city
I know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the Texas sky

Dear old pal, it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
Now I'll go and ride the range on the Texas road
But my love for you old pal, it shall linger on
I will a always thik of you although You're dead and goneLately you treat me so cold
And turning your back when you speak
You always give me the cold shoulder
And the only kiss you give me is on the cheek

    So goodby little darlin' I'm leavin'
    I'll never again walk thru your door
    I can tell by the way that you treat me
    That you don't love me anymore

You never put your arms around me
And hold me the way you used to do
I can't stay any more, I'm not wanted
It's all over darlin' me and youWell tonight I'm all alone no place to call me own
I don't have no one to love me any more
Gonna pack up my grape and take a long long trip
Back to the one that I love so

    Oh I what to go back to my darling
    Back to the one I love so well
    I know she'll be my wife and we'll settle down for life
    For she's the one that means the world to me

I can't forget the day I left and went away
You told me I'd be sorry some old day
Well I found it to be true so I'm heading back to you
Sweetheart I'm tired and want to settle down

  

When I get back to her my rambling days are oer
We'll build a little cottage on the hill
We'll think of days gone by sweetheart just you and I
And there we'll live so happy ever moreShe's from the hills of Kentucky
With waving long black hair
And lips as sweet as warm red wine
No others can compare

    I'm going honky tonking
    Everything's turned upside down
    But when I find that gal of mine
    We're really Gonna paint the town

They say we can't get married
They said my worth is you
They don't know what they're talking about
They don't know what we've gone through

  

Now when you see me coming
Better raise your window high
And when you see me leaving law, law
Hang down your head and cryOh John, john, john
    You better not fool around
    Go get a pick and a shovel
    Gonna dig a hole in the ground

Set me down in my easy chair
To rest my weary bones
My body's full of aches and pain
My better days are gone

Carry me down in the Cedar Gove
Where the honey suckle blooms
Lay me down in the yellar clay
Beside my lover's romb

  

Fifty-one years of married life
Twenty-one single at home
Lord ninety-nine years upon this earth
Twenty-seven of them all alone

John, you can have my one-eyed mule
He'll work and till the ground
You'll need him to haul me to my grave
Before the sun goes downSince first we met somehow I knew
It wouldn't last our whole life through
Now sure enough years later on
I look for you and gone

    Gone but not forgotten
    You're still in my memory
    Gone but not forgotten
    I'll stay right here till you come home to me

One rainy night a no good fight
When I awoke you were out of sight
Now after all that we been through
I thought I'd here just once from you

  

I search for you most every day
More sorry now than words can say
Maybe you don't live in this world
But you'll still be my only girlMy weary heart for you is crying
Getting old and playing for its dues
For you have left me oh so lonely
I've got those gone and left me blues

You know that we should be together
Though I'm the one that's been untrue
Please take me back and say you love me
I got those gone and left me blues

I might have known that you'd be leaving
I knew you'd bourne your walking shoes
Why did you break those vows of promise
And bring about those awful blues

Don't say that you have gone forever
The nights are much to lonely now
Alone I hope that you'll return dear
I've got to get you back some howOh, my golden slippers are laid away
Cause I don't spect to were'em till my wedding day
And my long tall coat that I love so well
I will wear up in the chariot in the morn
And my long white robe that I bought last June
I'm gonna get changed cause it fits too soon
And the old grey horse that I used to drive
I will hitch him to the chariot in the morn

    Oh, them golden slippers
    Oh, them golden slippers
    Golden slippers I'm gonna wear
    Because they look so near
    Oh, them golden slippers
    Oh, them golden slippers
    Golden slippers I'm a gonna wear
    To walk the golden street

Oh, my ol' banjo hangs on the wall
Cause it ain't been turned since way last fall
But the folks all say we'll have a good time
When we ride up in the chariot in the morn
There's old Brother Ben and his sister Luce
They will telegraph the news to Uncle Bacco Juice
What a great camp meeting there will be that day
When we ride up in the chariot in the morn

  

So, its goodbye, children, I will have to go,
Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow
And your ulster coast, why, you will not need
When you ride up in the chariot in the morn
But your golden slippers must be nice and clean
And your age must be just sweet sixteen
And your white kid gloves you will have to wear
When you ride up in the chariot in the mornFrom old Montana down to Alabam
I've been before, and I'll rtavel again
Your triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards, but you missed a play
Now hgit the road, and be on your way
I'm gonna board the golden rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a-running on time
But, baby, I'm switchin' to another line
So, honey, never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of running on the same old track
Bought a one-way ticket and I won't be back
This golden rocket's gonna roll my blues away

Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue, and by now you know
That I got another true love a-waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special's a-burnin' the rail
So, woman, don't try to follow my trail
This bolden rocket's a-rollin' my blues away

That old conductor, he seemed to know
That you done me wrong, I was feelin' low
For he yelled alound, "We're over that Dixon line"
The brekeman started singin' a song
Said "You're worried now, but it won't be long"
This gold rocket is leavin' your blues behind

Then the porter yelled, with his southern drawl
"Let's rise and shine, good mornin' ya all"
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
As I kissed my baby in the station door
That whistle blew like it never did before
Of the golden rocket that rolled my blues awayI hate to see night shadows fall, I hate to see a moon above
For it brings me dreamds of happy days gone by
When my darling Lola Lee strolled along the shore with me
And we watched the golden river glide on by

    Golden river, golden river, you took my love from me
    On your waves of golden hue, you carried her away with you
    And broke my heart a million, million ways

Now I sit and wonder why I feel so blue and cry
As I watch the moonclimb slowly in the sky
It was on a night like this when she gave me her last kiss
Climbed in her birch canoe and sailed awayOh, I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
    And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
    Oh, I'll pawn you this heart in my bosom
    If you'll say that you love me again

Darling, how can I stay here without you
I'll have nothing to cheer my poor heart
This old world will seem sad, love, without you
Tell me now that we're never to part

  

Take back all the gifts you have given
A gold ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It's a face that is false but it's fairThey say there is gold on the rainbow
But it seems so hard for me to find
All my thoughts still are lingering back there
With that dear one I've left behind

    Oh my dream girl still love you
    But where, oh where can you be
    They say there is gold on the rainbow
    I'm afraid there's no gold there for me

Through this whole world I'll keep on wandering
Tho' my thoughts will always be of you
They have taken you from me ny darling
But they can't take my memories of youI'm going to the races
    To see my pony run
    And if I win any reenbacks
    We're sure gonna have some fun

They say we can't get married
They say I'm not worthy of you
they don't know what they're talking about
they don't know what we've gone through

  

Now when you see me coming
Better raise your window high
And when you see me leaving little girl
Hang down your head and cry

  

Now when you go a-courtin'
There's something you should do
That long tail blouse that you wear
Don't do a thing for youI'm going to see my baby because I'm nearly crazy
I'm going to see my darling baby now
She's gone from me maybe, my curly hearded baby
But she will always keep a solemn vow

    My curly hearded baby she's gone from me now
    She's gone from my home in Tennessee
    Her love was like the sunshine her fact was like the roses
    She's gone oh she's gone now from me

She left me in the springtime although she was pining
Pining for the love that we had know
She was sweet as the sunshine that shone down from heaven
But now she's gone and left me all alone

  

I had her as a baby young and sweet and lovely
But now she's living on a far off shore
She left me oh so lonely for her on earth I'm grieving
Some day we'll meet and never part no moreI'm going to Chatanooga baby mine
Going to Chatanooga baby nine
Going to Chatanooga from there on to Cuba
Going to Chatanooga baby mine

    Going round this world baby mine
    Going round this world baby mine
    Going round this world with a banjo pickin' girl
    Going round this world baby mine

Gonna write me a letter baby mine
Write me a letter baby mine
Write me a letter gonna tell that you're better
Gonna write me a letter baby mineYour charms are closing in on my just like a prairie fire
It looks like very soon your gonna be my one desire
You really sold me with your smile and personality
You're giong like wildrfire with me

    Wildfire you're going like wildfire
    No matter where or how I've done, there you are
    Sweeping on and getting closer darling can't you see
    You're going like wildfire with me

When I took one first look at you I knew enough was said
Was like a brick wall tumbled down and hit me on the head
You've got me walking on a cloud I don't know A from Z
You're going like wildfire with me

  

I've even gone along so far to think of rice and rings
To choose a honeymoon night the balls and all those things
They can't be very far ahead if only you'll agree
You're going wildfire with meGoing to my home in the mountains
The mountains is where I want to be
You know I've never been happy
Since I left those hills of Tennessee

    Went away from home to save my mind
    Rorty years and I feel like eighty-nine
    Going back home, going to stay
    Where me and my guitar will sing and play

Going up in holler
Head up a moonshine still
I'll be so happy when I get there
Gonna dance all over them hills

  

Don't know why I ever left there
Must have been out of my mind
Ror staying away from the mountains
When I wanted to go back all the timeI'm going down, down, down
    Going down, down, down
    Got nobody to love me now
    I'm sorrow bound, bound, bound
    Since you left this town
    Since you left I'm going down, down, down

I never thought my life would be s lonely
I never thought my head could hang so low
I love you my dearling and you only
Don't know where you are but now I've got to go

  

For oh so many were your reasons
Could it be you never gave us time
In your heart if you desier a new love
If so that your heart is not with mine

I'll be singing with the angels in those mansions there on high
Be at home with my dear Savior, never more to say goodbye
Then again I'lll see my monm and daddy who went on before
Walk through glory shouting, singing on God's highway ever more

  *RefrainI was a stranger, brother, right in sin
Didn't even have the love of God within
But now I've found Him and I'm glad to say
I love my saviour more everyday

    God loves His children, brother, yes I know
    He will protect you anywhere you go
    Just call the point, He will get you there
    God will protect you, brother, anywhere

Brother, take warning while yet you have time
Don't let old Satan lead you on down the line
Just tell old Satan to stay out of your way
God loves His children, brother, everyday

�@ 

I'm glad I've found and I'm on my way
I'm going to follow Jesus everyday
Nothing can change me and I'm glad to say
God loves His children, brother, everyday

�@Go tell Aunt Nancy, go tell Aunt Nancy
Go tell Aunt Nancy the old gray goose is dead

It's the one she's been saving, the one she's been saving
The one she's been saving to make a feather bed

She died last Friday, she died last Friday
She died last Friday with an achin' in her head

Old grander's weeping, old grander's weeping
Old grander's weeping because his wife is deat

The goslins are mourning, the goslins are mourning
The goslins are mourning because their mother's deadI've tried so hard to make you happy
There's just one thing left to do
But if I can't ever make you happy
Go out and find somebody new

I love you like the trees love sunshine
God knows how much I love you
But if I can't ever make you all mine
Go out and find somebody new

I've tried so hard to make you love me
Just like other sweethearts do
But if I can't ever make you love me
Go out and find somebody new

I know I'll miss you so much darling
I know my heart will break in two
I know I want you to be happy
Go out and find somebody newWhile drinking alone in a tavern one day
My eyes they hardly could see
I heard a kind voice ringing so loud and clear
And here is what the voice said to me

    Go home ( go home ) go home ( go home )
    And kneel by your bedside and pray
    Go home ( go home ) go home ( go home )
    God will answer your prayer today

I staggered across the room to the door
I almost fell on the floor
I'm sure there was laughter but I could not hear
For the words that still ring in my ear

 

God sobered my mind and He saved my soul
And he erased my thoughts from all fear
Then back to the tavern I preached of these words
The words that still ring in my ear

 

The crowd started leaving with heads bowed so low
As the bartender picked up the key
As he locked the door he murmured these words
Was the same words that God spoke to meThere's love
    There's love in his sweet word
    There's peace
    There's peace to feel within
    There's life
    There's life he gave this world
    So I'm giving my soul back to him

There's the image of him in everyone
He gave us his love with he gave us his son
So wash in the blood and cleanse your soul from sin
God gave you life that never will end

 

I wandered lost from my savior's arms
Caught in the sea and couldn't calm the storm
Then God gave me place that only he could aend
Now I'm back on the track and I'll never leave againAs an army we're marching toward heaven
So it's best that together we stand
We may not have the same rank or title
But we're soldiers so give me your hand

    Oh, I care not what church you belong to
    Just as long as for God you may stand
    If your heart today is as my heart
    You're my brother so give me your hand

You may not come to our great cathedral
But belong to some small praying band
But if you love my Chirist, the Redemer
You're a Chiristian, so give me your hand

  

We are bound for that beautiful city
Where before the white throne we shall stand
And we'll be as one there together
Hallelujah, so give me your handOne evening while out on a ramble
The hour was just about nine
I met a young maiden in Frisco
On the corner of Kearny and Pine

On her face there was beauty of nature
Her eyes just seemed to expand
Her hair was so rich and so brilliant
Entwined in a blue velvet band

We stolled down the street together
In my pocket she placed her small hand
She planted the evidence on me
The girl in the blue velvet band

I heard the scream of the siren
And the girl in the blue evlvet band
She left me to face all my trouble
With a diamond that was worth ten grand

They sent me to San Quentin for stealing
God knows I'm an innocent man
The guilty one now she is dying
The girl in the blue velvet band

Last night when bed-time was nearing
I was standing there close to the bars
I fancied I heard a voice calling
Far out in the ocean of stars

I'll be out in a week and I'm leaving
But I'll carry the name of a man
That has spent ten years in prison
For the girl in the blue velvet band

But when I get out I'll endeavor
To live in some other new land
I'll bid farewell to old Frisco
And the girl in the blue velvet bandI walked out tonight for a ramble round
I didn't mean to stay, just to view the town
When I saw her smilin' from a far
As she walked into that crossroads bar

Well I walked inside and sat me down
Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it down
She came and set beside me there
With a dark brown eyes and the red, red hair

I told her that I love her true
Anything you want I'll surely do
Said a man like you don't get too far
With a girl like me at the crossroads bar

I like smokey lights and a lonesome song
And I won't do right if I can do you wrong
You want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
And you won't find love at the crossroads bar

Come all my friends and take my advice
Keep your love at home with your lovely wife
You're better off than you think you are
And you won't find love at the crossroad barAbout three miles from the Bateau of York
From the river's curve or down
Not far south of the town des pauls
Sullivan's shack was found
Back on the higher ground
You could see him everyday
Walking down the line
With an old bound shack across his back
And his long hair down behind
Speaking his worried mind

    It's a long way to the delta
    From the Nnorth Georgia hills
    And a tug shack full of ginseng
    Won't pay no travelling bills
    And I'm too old to ride the rail
    Or thumb the road alone
    Well I guess I'll never make it back to home
    My muddy water Mississippi delta home

Now the winter's here and it gets so cold
Damping make me ill
That you can't dig no roots by the mountain side
Cause the ground froze hard and still
You gatta wait at the foot of the hill
But next summer things will pay high
I'll make enough money to pay my bills
And dig there mountain, good-bye
Then he said with a sighI've been around this world a lot, I've had a lot of fun
I'm sometimes in the money and I'm sometimes on the bum
I've had my share of loving with the women, I have a way
But last night in a country town things turned the other way

I walked up to a pretty girl, I thought I'd have my way
For she had lots of smiles for me but not a word to say
I took her boldly by the hand with a heart so light and gay
When I rose up off the ground these words I heard her say

    Get lost, drop dead, begone you wolf I say
    What makes you think that you're so cute, you're getting in my way
    I've been around a bit my lad and I ain't no one's fool
    Get lost, drop dead, begone you wolf, you're nothing but a fool

What makes you think you're cute my lad as if no one could see
Why, you've got hay seed in your hair, you're bending at the knees
I'm telling you you're just a fool, you'd better be on your way
I turned around, my head dropped down, once more I heard her sayI wouldn't marry in the wintertime
Or the spring when the birdies call
Court them girls in the summertime
Leave them in the fall

    Get along down town
    Get along down town
    Get along down to Newport town
    To lay my money down

Rich girl uses cold cream
Poor girl uses lard
My gal uses axle grease
But she rubs it twice as hard

 

Beefsteak when I'm hungry
Whiskey when I'm dry
Greenback when I'm hard up
Heaven when I die

 

I'd marry up with that girl of mine
Try to settle down
But everytime the wold goose calls
Get along down townLove those Georgia Pineywoods
    Wonder if they miss me
    Love those Georgia Pineywoods
    Ancient home of the Cree and the Cherokee and me

I was born in the Georgia Pineywoods
Fifteen miles to the grocery store
No T.V., no blue plated shiney goods
Krackled linoleum on the floor

We had cows in the back fields a grazin
Chickens, clucking in our back fence
Times were good and ain't in the making
I didn't live like that back then

  

I used to look for Indian arrowheads
I was happy as Porter's cow
I lost all my Indian arrowheads
They ain't no good to me here, no how

I work hard get paid by the hour
And live my typical Southern life
Shining cars and making power
And I own more money than Caesar's wifeGeorgia, georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia, georgia, a song of you
Come as sweet and clear as
Moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams
I see the road leads back to you
Georgia, Georgia, no place I find
Just an old sweet song
Keep Georgia on my mindAs I sit here alone with my memories
Thinking back to the years long ago
To the pine covered hills down in Georgia
And the sweet girl that I used toknow
She was young and in love with my only
I was footloose and foolish I guess
So I wondered right out of her sweet Georgia heart
And the fact that I'm lonely tells the rest

    How I miss my Georgia girl today
    How I miss the pine woods
    And the red hot Georgia clay
    I miss my simple life, so many miles away
    How I miss my Georgia girl today

There's a moon shining bright on my doorstep
Like I've seen shining bright in her eyes
But it's cold here in Feirbanks, Alaska
And I shilver thougt the long winter night
Fifteen years have slipped through my fingers
I'm forgetten I know by this time
But I'd walk through the snow
Down to Georgia in the cold
If I through she'd be waiting this timeWay down in the blue ridge mountain
    Way down where the tall pines grow
    Lives my sweetheart of the mountain
    She's my little Georgia rose

Now come and listen to my story
A story that I think is true
My little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With the hair of gold,and the heart so true

  

Her mother left her with another
A carefly life she had planned
The baby now is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand

  

We'd oftan sing old song togather
I like to do, I do recall
She'd smile at me when I was telling her
And she was my sweetheartI'm Georgia bound, gotta find my baby
    That gal of mine has left this town, town, town
    Just losin' her, gonna drive my crazy
    I'm on my way I'm Georgia bound

That gal of mine left me this morning
Said she was tired of hanging round, round, round
But I don't care can't live without her
gotta bring her back I'm Georgia bound

 

Two red, red lips as sweet as honey
And golden hair, her eyes so brown, brown, brown
She's on that train bound for Atlanta
I'll bring her back, I'm Georgiaa boundI've been gathering fower's from the hillside
To wreathe around your brow
But you kept me waiting so long, dear
The flowers have all withered now

I know that you have seen trouble
You are hanging down yuour head
Your love for me is like the flowers
Your love for me is deadDeath is an angel sent down from above
Sent for the buds and the flowers we love
Truly 'tis so, for in heaven's own way
Each soul is a flower in the Moster's bouquet

    Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet
    Beautiful flowers that will never decay
    Gathered by angels and carried away
    Forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet

Let us be faithful till life's work is done
Blooming with love till the reapers shall come
Then we'll be gathered together someday
Transplanted to bloom in the Master's bouquetI hurried through the darkness
The last time my darling to see
I heard those bloodhounds crying
The sheriff was coming after me

    She had the sun in her hair
    Lips like cherry wine
    She loved nobody slse
    Now I sit and pine

They said I killed a stranger
They tried to hang me high
I ran as fast as I could go
I wished that I could flyIt wass only yesterday that I heard you say
You wanted me more than silver or gold
Now another's love you have and our love has grown cold
It's a long way from your heart to mine

    It's a long long way from your heart to mine
    I didn't really mean to be unkind
    But I cheated and I lied and I ever made you cry
    It's a long way from your heart to mine

It was such a short time from the day we met
I held you closely in my arms
Then you went away and I went astray
It's a long way from your heart to mineThe story's in the Bible, it's a message sad but true
The life our Saviour lived on earth is told
Found upon the pages of the Master's book of truth
Every word so precious to my soul

    From the manger to the cross, rugged cross of Calvary
    The road that Jesus walked for you and me all alone
    By the world forsaken, still He shed His blood for me
    From the manger to the cross, the rugged cross of Calvary

Amidst the stranger'ss cattle where the birth of Jesus came
The lonely manger kept Him from the cold
And there was the beginning of the journey Jesus made
Today it is the greatest story told

  

Many wonders were revealed, while here on earth He dwelled
He healed the sick, and made the blind to see
Five thousand were the numbers of the hungry who did feast
He blessed and multiplied the bread and meat

  

No earthly treasures did He own, He sought no wealth or fame
Weary was the path He had to trod
Here He suffered many things for this world knew Him not
He died upon the cross, the Son of GodIts a long time I've waited my darling
Just hoping some day you'd settle down
But now its too late it's sll over
From now on I won't be hanging around

    From now on I won't be hanging around
    From now on I won't be hanging around
    I've taken all I can find another man
    From now on I won't be hanging around

I've tried and I've tried to make you love me
But bright lights and bright life I've found
Its the only love you've ever known my darling
From now on I won't be hanging aroundCasey Jones he was a mighty man
But now he's resting in the promised land
The kind of music he could understand
Was an eight wheel driver under his command

    He made the freight train boogie
    All the time
    He made the freight train boogie
    As he rolled down the line

When the fireman started ringing the bell
Everybody hung around to tell
Casey Jones was a coming to town, on a six
Eight wheeler that was flat on the groundI was born in Dixie in a boomer shack
Just a little ahanty by the railroad track
The humming of the driver was my lullaby
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry

    I got the freight train blues, Lawdy, Lawdy
    Got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
    And when the whistle blows I gotta, Oh Lawdy
    Guess I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues

My daddy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of the engineer
My sweetie is a brakeman and that ain't no joke
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

  

Aeroplanes and autos always leave me cold
The moaning of a steamboat never stirs my soul
The only thing that makes me want to navigate
Is a wildcat whistle on a south bound freight

  

I know I'm old enough to quit this running round
I've tried a hundred times to stop and settle down
But every time I find a place I'd like to stay
I hear a freight train holler and I'm on my wayFreight train, freight train, run so fast
Freight train, freight train, urn so fast
please don't tell what train I'm on
So they won't know what route I've gone

When I am dead and in my grave
No more good times here I'll crave
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all that I'm gone to sleep

When I die, lord, bury me deep
Way down on old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old Number Nine
As she comes rolling by

When I die, Lord, bury me deep
Way down on old Chestnut Street
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all that I'm gone to sleepI'm as free a little bird as I can be
I'm as free a little bird as I can be
I'm free at my age as a bridie in the cage
I'm as free a little bird as I can be

Carry me home, little birdie, carry me home
Carry me home, little birdie, carry me home
Carry me home, to my wife, she's the joy of my life
Carry me home, little birdie, carry me home

I'll never build my nest on the ground
Neither in the forks of a tree
I'll build my nest in the ruffle of her dress
Where the bad boys can never bother meI was born in the Southland Twenty some old years ago
I ran away for the first time when I was four years old

    I'm a free born man
    My home is on my back
    I know every inch of hiway
    Every foot of back road
    Every mile of railroad track

I got a gal in Chincinnati, got a woman in San Antone
I always love the girl next door but anyplace is home

  

I got me a worn out guitar, I carry an old tone sack
I hocked it about two hundred times but I always get it back

  

Well, you may not like my appearance, you may not like my song
You may not like the way I talk, but you like the way I'm goneFrankie and Johnnie were lovers
Lordy how they did love
They swore to be true to each other
Just as true as the stars above
He was her man but he's doing ger wrong

Frankie she was a good woman
Just as every one knows
She gave her man a hundred dollars
Just to buy him a new suit of clothes
He was her man but he done her wrong

Johnnie went down to the corner
He asked for a glass of beer
Frankie went down in an hour or so
Said has my loving Johnnie been here
He's my man but he's doing me wrong

I ain't gonna tell you no stories
I ain't gonna tell you no lies
I saw your lovin' Johnnie
Making love to Nellie Bligh
He's your man but he's doing you wrong

Frankie went home in a hurry
She didn't go for fun
She hurried home to get a hold of
A big forty four gun
He's her man but he's doing her wrong

Roll me over darling
Roll me over slow
Roll me on my right side
Cause my left one hurts me so
He's my man but he done me wrongShe walk through the corn leading down to the river
    Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
    She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
    And left me to die like the fox on the run
    Like the fox, like the fox, like the fox, like the fox on the run

Everybody knows the reason for the fall
When woman tempted man down in paradise's hall
This woman tempted me alright, then took me for a ride
But like the lonely fox I need a place to hide

  

Come take a glass of wine and fortify your soul
We'll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I'll illustrate, a girl put me on the floor
The game is nearly up, the hounds are at my poorI never had a pair of shoes that weren't old hand me downs
And daddy's morning coffee came from old left over grounds
Moma wore nojeweiry or any store buoght stuff
Our home was on the hillside forty miles from Popular Bluff

    Forty miles back in Missouri there's different way of life
    Where a man think of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
    Life is far from fancy sometimes kinda ruff
    But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Popular Bluff

Our only family treasure was a beat up radio
It took us to the places we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we aleays had enough
Cause money never mattered much forty miles Popular Buff

  

Near every whinter when the snow on the grund
The road would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
But if daddy had his tobacco and trandma had her snuff
The winters didn't seem so long forty miles from Popular BuffThey stood in the moonlight near by the gate
Goodbye my darling I know you'll wait
She ceased her weeping, and smiled through her tears
Saying I've been true love thruough these long years

For on tomorrow at the break of day
He was to journey for far away
He held her closer his promised bride
And to her questions these words repliced

    I've loved you always, Yes I've been true
    My heart shall never be loveless for you
    Oh Darling believe me, far over the sea
    Though live or death so faithful I'll be

One year passed by, He's coming home
His pilgrimage over, no longer to roam
And smiling he thinks of her shining eyes
Shining with welcome, a glad surprise

A dainty letter he takes from his breast
To which he extends his lips close pressed
And reading once more by the warming light
These words he had spoken to her that night

 

nce more he's reached the old garden gate
But he arrives alas, alas it's too late
The wedding is over, The knot is tied
He finds his darling another's bride

And later they found him there on the grass
A pistol near by him told what had passed
They saw the letter explaining the deed
And in the pale moonlight these words she did readForgotten man who lie asleep, across the ocean's waves
    Who fought and died, for the flag that waves
    Across their lonely graves

The flag still waves, so proud and free
Across our land today
Let's not forget the boys who died
Across the watery spray

  

Their pictures hang, upon the wall
But their names are not mentioned at home
As the years go my our memories dim
We forget our loved ones are goneOh my lady, sweet love of mine
Forget me not while I'm away
Across the blue slow rollin' ocean
I will return to you some day

Through the4 dark and dreary night
I dreamed I held you here beside me
When I awoke I heard behind me
The sound of guns and distant drums

Forget me not,I feel so 'lone lost and lonely, like a child
May be I just need to see somebody smile

Are you thinking of all the times
When we were runnin' on through the green fields
My eyes are closed, still I see the green fields
They seem to sing, they seem to sing

Forget me not, I feel so 'lone lost and lonely, like a child
May be I just need to see someday smileForgive me for all the pain I've cause you
Forgive me for unkind words I've said
I thought once that I could live without you
Please forgive me and I'll make it up somehow

I left you and left you broken hearted
I left you but now I can't forget
I thought cnce that I could live without you
But I'm paying with a broken heart instead

I wish I had never made you blue sweet heart
I wish I could live it over now
I thought once that I could live without you
Please forgive me and I'll make it up somehowWhen you're troubled and distressed
Pray to God please give you rest
He will I know for the Bible tells me so
Ask your father in the sky
To cleanse a sinful soul that crys
He will I know for the Bilbe tells me so

    For the Bible tells me so
    And I want the world to know
    He will I know
    For the Bible tells me so

If you're wanting peace of mind
Leave old Satan far behind
Take up they cross and follow him
Moses stood on holy ground 
He felt God's presence all around
I know, I know, for the Bible tells me soThat's what you get for loving me
    That's what you get for loving me
    Everything you had is gone
    As you can see thats what you get for loving me

I ain't the kind to hang around
With any new love that I've found
Moving is my stock and trade
I'm moving on, I'll think of you when I'm gone

  

So don't she'd a tear for me
I'm not the love you'd thought I'd be
Not a hungry boy like you
So don't be blue I'll have a thousand fore I'm through

  

There you go you're crying again
There you go you're crying again
Then someday when your poor heart is on the mend
I jist might pass this way againNow some folks like the summertime
When the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green
It's pleasant there, no doubt
But give me the wintertime
When the snow is on the ground
I found her when the snow on the ground

    I traced her little footprints in the snow
    I found her little footprints in the snow
    Bless that happy day when Nellie list her way
    I found her when the snow was on the ground

I went out to see her
There was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out
But would be trturning soon
I found her little footprints and
I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground

  

Now she's up in heaven
She's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her
In that promised land
Everytime the snow falls
It brings back memories
I found her when the snow was on the groundOnece I had a true love sweeter than the stars above
And I loved her with all my heart
It brought tears in her eyes when I told her goodbye
All because of my fool foolish pride

    Oh, foolish pride I can't live with you
    For you have driven away my darling
    You have broken her heart now you're keeping us apart
    Foolish pride i'll never forgive you

We would sat all alone she would talk of our home
And of days when she'd be my own wife
So softly she would say when is our wedding day
I'm so happy my darling I could cryIf I was on some foggy mountain top
    I'd sail away to the West
    I'd sail all around this whole wide would
    To the girl love the best

Now if you see that girl of mine
There's something I want you to tell her
Tell her not to be wasting her time
Running around with some other feller

  

Oh she's caused me to weep and ahe's caused me to moan
She caused me to leave my home
The lonesome pines and the good old times
I'm on my way back home

  

Oh if I'd only listrened to what my mama said
I would not have been here today
Lying around this old jail cell
Just a-weeping my poor life awayWhen I was a batchelor I lived all alone
I worked at the weaver's trade
And the only only thing I ever did that was wrong
Was to woo a fair young maid
I wooed her in the winter-time
And in the summer too
And the only only thing I ever did tha was wrong
Was to keep her from the foggy foggy dew

One night she appeared at my bedside
As I lay sleeping there
The moonlight gleamed on her pale pale face
And glistened on her coal black hair
She wept, she cried, she tore her hair
Ah me! what could I do ?
So all night long I held her in my arms
Just to keep her from the foggy foggy dew

Now I am a batchelor, I live with my son
We work at the weaver's trade
And every single time that I look into his eyes
He reminds me of the fair young mind
He reminds me of the winter-time
And of the summer too
And the many many times that I held her in my arms
Just to keep her from the foggy foggy dewPoor little bluebird, in a pink cherry tree
Why are you looking so sorrowful at me
Is it because you're as lonely as I
No one to love you and no place to fly

    Fly, little bluebird, fly away
    No need to linger, no need to stay
    Time you were leaving, time to take wings
    Up in the blue sky, your blue heart can sing

Flowers are blooming, on the green mountain side
Mybe I'll go there my sorrows to hide
Or should I stay here waiting so true
It wonders me greatly what I should do

  

Even a love nest in a pink cherry tree
Can't hold a wild heart that longs to be free
If I should leave here to see her today
Would she still love me or turn me awaySummer's gone and winter times a-coming
And where I am ain't where I want to be
I can hear my southern home a-calling
And it's calling out the old wild goose in me

    Flyin', flyin', south to Dixie
    Lord I feel so lonesome and alone
    Stayin' ain't no use cause my hearts an old wild goose
    Tomorrow I'll be flyin' south an home

I've got kissin' kin down in kentucky
I've got losts of Alabam'
Mama's a-waitin' down in Mississippi
And my sis is in south carolina's honeyland

Grandma and Grandpa's down in Georgia
My sweetheart's waitin' back in Tennessee
There's a little part of all the southland in my heart
And, honey, in the south is where I long to beFly around, my pretty little miss
    Fly around, my daisy
    Fly around, my pretty little miss
    You almost drive me crazy

The higher up the cherry tree
The riper grows the cherries
The more you hug and kiss the girls
The sooner they will marry

  

Coffee grows on white oak trees
The river flows with brandy
If I had my pretty little miss
I'd feed her sugar candy

  

Going to get some weevily wheat
I'm going to get some barley
Going to get some weevily wheat
And bake a cake for CharlieThose pretty wild flowers I love them so well
The flowers know secrets that I'll never tell
I go out to pick a bouquet of all
And bring them all in before the leaves start to fall

    When the leaves start to fall and the flowers have died
    If only little darling I could be by your side
    Tho' it breaks my heart to hear your name
    Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring

I wish I could see her and talk of our love
And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I'll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way

  

The memories of you deat I'll never erase
There'll never be another that can take your place
I'll still keep our secret with the flowers of love
And we'll pick them together in Heaven aboveI've been gathering flowers from the hillside
    To wreathe around your brow
    But you've kept me a-waiting so long, dear
    That the flowers have all withered now

I know that you have seen trouble
But never hang down your head
Your love for me is like the flowers
Your love for me is now dead

  

It was on one bright june morning
The roses were in bloom
I shot and killed my darling
OH, what will be my doom

  

Those eyes can't see these roses
Those hands can't hold them you know
Those lips so still can not kiss me
They are gone from me forever moreNow boys gather 'round, take a tip form me
I'm sure that you will all agree
If you let a gal foot you with fate
You'll soon be swinging on the golden gate

    You'll miss out on all the fun
    If you make love to only one
    You'd better take heed to my little song
    Find 'em, fool 'em and leave 'em alone

That little love bug is the cutest thing
At first its sweet but it makes its sting
You'll find the wound is hard to treat
Be sure you play this little game neat

  

Now if you find a gal you like
Just date her once but no more than twice
If you don't watch her little ways
She'll spoil your happy ramblin' dayI was happy, oh so happy
Living down old Mississippi way
I was living with my pappy
Fifteen years ago today

When I left him in the gloaming
I recall I heard him say
You'll be sorry that you're going
Fifteen years ago today

I met a slicker from the city
And he stole my heart away
How he fooled me what a pity
Fifteen years ago today

And he told me if I'd go with him
That a fortune we would me
But he left me for another
Fifteen years ago today

Now I'm sitting by my lonesome
For each wrong I now must pay
I remember I wasn't lonesome
Fifteen years ago todayTempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested tho' in the wrong

    Father along we'll know all about it
    Father along we'll understand why
    Cheer up, my brother live in the sunshine
    We'll understand it all by and by

When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

  

Faithful till death said our loving Master
A few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing
As we sweep thru the beautiful gate

  

When we see Jesus coming in glory
When He comes from His home in the sky
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion
We'll unserstand it all by and byThe most wanted fastest grass alive
    Livin' on somewhere on that mountain side
    Finger picking good kentucky side
    Wanted fastest grass alive

Up rocky top there live the brede brothers
Alvis, Rufus, Festus, Fred and little will
They can lay that a gluegrass down
Sicker than a blue tip hound
And sweeter than the moonshine from their still

  

The sheriff sent a posse up that mountain
He said place them bred'n boy under arrest
But the posse went stone blind on music and moonshine
They must be up there cause friend
They ain't come down the mountain yetThe family who prays will never be parted
    Their circle in geaven unbroken shall stand
    God will say Enter my good faithful servant
    The family who prays never shall part

Satan has parted fathers and mothers
Filling their hearts with his envy and hate
Aiding their pathway down to destruction
Leaving their children like orphans to stray

  

Wars and tornadoes are taking our loved ones
Leaving us tearful with sad aching hearts
But we shall join them over the river
For the family who prays never shall partAll alone in a wigwam
In eighteen sixty-three
There lived a fair Indian maiden
They calledher Fallen Leaves

Pretty as the stars up above you
Fair as the moon in the trees
Because she was born in October
They called her Fallen Leaves

There came a trooper one morning
Just at the break of day
He stopped to rest at the wigwam
Of the shy little Indian maid

Fallen Leaves the breezes whispered
Fallen Leaves the breezes sighed
When he rode on that evening
Fallen Leaves rode by his side

One night while she lay sleeping
The moon was shining bright
He stole away from the campfire
Then rode into the night

Fallen Leaves the breezes whispered
Fallen Leaves the breezes sighed
Our in that lonesome old forest
Fallen Leaves she lingered and diedSinging the fallen eagle
Fill the copter smile
Chasing round the mountain
Chasing till they born
They say that it's just sporting
Shooting them on the wing
The world around 'em clatters
You can hear the mountains ring
Hear their song, it won't be long

Singing the western ranges
The eagle takes his land
He's got a thousand mothers
Hit off near the dam
Get up with the sunrise
Everybody gather around
Get in with the first shot
Ther're to bring you down
Down, down, crash on the ground

Singing the noble eagle
Help is on the way
The government team of experts
Is rusing to your aid
I know you're noe excited
An eagle is no way
Fly up to Canada
This country isn't sane
Anymore, that's for sureCome all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they're gone

They'll tell to you some loving story
And they'll make you think that they love you well
And away they'll go and court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell

I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I'd write a letter to my false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink

I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I'd fly to the arms of my false true lover
And when he'd ask, I would deny

Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it's new
But love grows cold as love grows old
And fades away like morning dewAs I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love

    I miss you, Darling, more and more every day
    As heaven would miss the stars above
    With every heartbeat I still think of you
    And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said good-bye
I remember our faded loveMy brave boy sleeps in his faded coat of blue
In a lonely grave unknown lies a heart that was so true
They sat faint and hungry among the Spanish braves
they laid him sad and lonely within his nameless grave

    No more the bugle calls the weary one
    Rest noble spirit in their graves unknown
    For we'll find you and know you among the good and true
    Where a robe of white is given for a faded coat of blue

He cried give me water and just a little crumb
And my mother she will bless you through all the years to come
And tell my sweetest sister so gentle good and true
I'll meet her in heaven dressed in white instead of blue

 

No dear one was near him to close his small blue eyes
No gentle voice was by him to give him sweet reply
No stone marks the lonely spot on the lad so brave and true
In a lonely grave he's sleeping in his faded coat of blueI am a face lost in the crowd
A defeated man no one cares about
For the dreams I've had are gone somehow
I'm just a face lost in the crowd

All hopes of wealth and fame are gone
And darkness looms where the sun once shone
No light is there, the fire's burned out
And I'm just a face lost in the crowd

The tears I've shed now blur my eyes
The friends I've known would not recognize
This broken man with no way out
I'm just a face lost in the crowdTrue love it has been untill now, dear
They tell me that true love is blind
But right now I see
It's as plain as can be
You've come to the end of the line

You though you would leave me broaken hearted
You though you would leave me way behinde
Well I've paid my fare
You've had more than your share
You've come to the end of the line

You've rode fore half fare until now dear
But you boarded the wrong bus this time
So I have transfare for you
Well you made me blue
You've come to the end of the line

You though you would leave me broken hearted
You though you that would break this heart of mine
Well I've has enough 
You can pack up your stuff
You've come to the end of the line

Well I've had enough
You con pack up your stuff
You've come to the end of the lineDown at the end of memory lane
    There's many who have walked it in gladness
    I was the one who walked it last
    I walked it alone in sadness

I received a letter from my love
I opened it and this is what it said
I'm sorry if hurt you, but now it is too late
For another man my darliung I have wed

  

I remember her sweet little face
And her little freckied nose
With her golden hair hanging down her back
Tied with a big blue ribbon bow

  

We were pais and chums together there
I loved her with all my hwart and soul
But she married another without a thought or care
And she left me in this world alone and coldYou'll own the deed to my heart for a lifetime
It's yours to have and keep or throw away
The memories you have me I'll keep forever
They're all I have but in my heart they'll stay

    I've known a long long time, this day was coming
    And now I feel relieved that you are gone
    But if aomeday you feel, like you could love me
    There empty arms will welcome you back home

I'm sure you'll find the happiness you're seeking
The best in life, someday I hope you'll find
And when you do, if I can see you happy
Then maybe somehow I'll find peace of mineEmotions are making me care more for you
I've found a heart I know will always be so true
But still dearest darling I feel kinda blue
Keep wondering if, someday, somehow I might lose you

    Emotions, are making me long for your kiss
    For safe in your arms I know heavenly bliss
    Emotions, in my heart are calling for you
    If you confess I bet you have emotions too

Emotions can bring you much sorrow and pain
Emotions can be like the sunshine after rain
Emotions are charged with the power of fate
There same emotions make you love or make you hateIt's eight-thirty now, I'm still waiting for you
I  wonder where you can be
You promised to come home but now I'm all alone
And I've got those eight thirty blues

    You better stop your rambling and stay in your place
    Or else I won't be waiting for you
    But if you won't listen, just do as you please
    I won't have those eight thirty blues

It's eight thirty now but you don't seem to care
How long I've waited for you
Sweetheart when you get home you'll find you're all alone
Then you'll have those eight thirty bluesI've traveled o'er this country wide a seeking fortune fair
I've been down the two coast lines, I've traveled everywher
Form portland East and Portland West and back along the line
I'm going now to a place that's best, that old home town of mine

    Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
    Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
    I knew some day that I'd come back, I knew it from the start
    Eight more miles to Louisville, the home town of my heart

There's sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville, she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

  

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two, we'll never want to roam
The place that's right fot that love site is in those bluegrass hills
Where gentiy flows the Ohio by a place called LouisvilleEating out of your hand, you think you've hot me on a string
    You've fooled me more than once, but let me tell you just one thing
    Someday I'll leave you woman, then you'll understand
    A man can only take so much of eating out of your hand

I'm tired of eating out of your hand, I'm tired of getting told
These blues are leaving me as of now, I'll be the one son bold
You better walk the chalk line and let this poor man be
Or else you'll find yourself alone footloose and fancy free

  

When I come home you're waiting to question what I've done
You have my free time planned for me I work from sun to sun
If only you would realize that old stuff gets old
A man likes just a little time that he can call his own

  

You're oh so domineering, your wish is my command
Your jealous heart won't let me live you boss me and demand
New clothes, a diamond ring so fine, a Cadillac is grand
On payday I'm your victim and I'm eating out of your handI never wea so lonesome for my home town
Seems I never was so far away
Now I can here the freight train a blowing
I'll be gone before the break of day
I'll have to quit my daily rambling
Tonight I'm gonna start my journey back
Sitting on the top an old box car
Sailling down that silvery stream of track

    East bound freight train, east bound freight train
    Take me home again
    East bound freight train, east bound freight train
    Let me stay till the end

Now I'll never stray from my home town
Never leave again to roam
I know that I was born to wander
But I'm gonna stick around my home
Now I see the smoke a rolling
Out on that old smoke stack
I'm sitting on the top of an old box car
Sailing sown that silvery stream of trackI was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I met a fair, young maiden
And her name, I did not know

On her hair was dark and curly
Cheeks were roses red
Oh, her breast she wore my clear leaf
Where I longer tolay my head

I don't want your greenback dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is your heart, darling
Say you'll take ma back again

The oceans deep and I can't wade in
And I have no wings to fly
I'll escape, my blue-eyed, boat land
Float or roll me over time

I'll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain't my home
I'll go back to East Virginia
Leave them north Carolina aloneIt was springtime when I found you like a flower
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I soon could see your love was changing
Broke my heart to see what wintertime had done

    Like the weather your heart canges with each season
    Springtime, summer, fall, and winter too
    Though I know I'll never understand the reason
    I still wonder why each season changes you

Come spring, you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall again, I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old miseryA thousand miles dear, a thousand more
Across the waters, across the shore
I'll say a prayer dear for you and mine
please think of me dear, each night at nine

I'll hold your picture close to my heart
It takes your place dear while we're apart
Helps to remind me that you're still mine
To feel your nearness, each night at nine

The bugle's playing, out go the lights
Gee, but it's lonesome these army nights
Please tell the kiddies I'm doing fine
Give them my love dear, each night at nineHere I lay upon my dying pillow
Around my bed there's someone getting dark
They are watching the saddest thing that can happen
They are seeing a sinner as he dies

    As death's cold shadow hovers o'er me
    To all sinners I plead with my last breath
    Don't shun the work of God that's what I've done
    And tonight I'm dying a sinner's death

No one can know until he faces it
How bad dying a sinner can be
I'm facing it now as I plead with you
Don't let it be with you as it is with me

 

My eyes feel so heavy as death claims me
No one can truthfully say I'm going to rest
When you look upon my face please have pity
Yes pity and hope for the bestI went into a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all their books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked hem for the Bible, when they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a finger print was plain

    Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
    The words of all our prophets and the saying of our Lord
    Of all the other books you'll find there's none salvation holds
    Get that dust off the Bible, and redeem your poor soul

You can read your magazines, read of love and tragic things
But not one word of Bible berse, not a Scripture do you know
When it is the very truth, and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered o'er it, it is sure to doom your soul

 

If you have a friend you'd like to help along life's way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible, trade the wrong way for the rightMy sweetheart is gone and gone and I'm so lonely
She said that she and I were through
I started out a-drinking for a past time
Driving nails in my coffin over you

    I'm driving nails in my coffin
    Even time I drink a bottle of booze
    I'm just driving nail in my coffin
    Driving nails in my coffin over you

Now ever since the day that we parted
I've been so sad so blue
I can't help thinkin' about her
And I just can't quit drinkin' that old booze

 

Well you turned me down you don't want me
There's nothing more I can do
I'll be driving nails in my coffin
Wrryin' my darlin' over youYou sit there a-crying, crying in your beer
You say you've got troubles, my friend listen here
Don't tell me your troubles got enough of my own
Be thankful you're livin', drink up and go home

    I'm fresh out of prison, six years in the pen
    Lost my wife and family, no one to call freind
    Don't tell me your troubles, got enough of my own
    Be thankful you're livin', drinking up and go home

Back there sets a blind man, so blind he can't see
Yet he's not complaining, why should you or me
Don't tell me your troubles, got enough of my own
Be thankful you're livin', drink up and go homeAs my boat draws near the harbor
Knowing soon that you'll be mine
But if another has you darling
I'll go drifting with the tide

    I have crossed the great wide ocean
    I have waited for the time
    But if another has you darling
    I'll go drifting with tide

Along, long time has passed my darling
Since that night you made those vows
I know my heart would break with sorrow
If you should say it's over now

  

I'm in love with you my darling
And I'm praying you'll be mine
But if you change your mind my darling
I'll go drifting with tideI had a dreams of you the other night, dear
A dream I couldn't live in true lite I fear
You talked with a triend of mine so lovingly
Oh God, Oh God, a crazy dream, please left it be

    Dreams, dreams of you , dear
    Tears, Tears are so sincere
    Love, love, that I can't hide
    There dreams are breaking down all my pride

While musics played, he danced and held you, oh so tight
The some way wed when our loves was young and bright
Then he kissed you under light that were so dim
I couldn't stand to see you there alone with him

  

I realize the dream is only fantasy
Oh, tell me why there dreams seem so real to me
Every night I have this same old misery
I guess it's just because of all my JealousyA miner was leavin' his home for his work
When he heard his little child scream
He went to the side of the little one there
Oh, Daddy, I've had such a dream

    Oh, Daddy, don't go to the mines today
    For dreams have so often come true
    Oh, Daddy, dear Daddy, please don't go away
    I never could live without you

I dreamed that the mines were all blazing with fire
And the miners all fought for their lives
The families seemed changed, and the mouth of the mine
Was covered with sweetheart and wives

  

Go down to the village and tell all your friends
As sure as the bright sun does shine
There's something that's going to happen today
Oh , Daddy, don't go to that mineIn dreams of yesterday I wondered back to my little cabin door
I strolled beside an old rock garden and saw familar once more
I heard the organ softly playing its music came so sweet and low
And I hear my Mother sweetly singing so oft I did so long ago

I heard her sing the Rock Of Ages and Silver Threads Among The Gold
She told me once again of Jesus with in little cabin door
She opened up a faded Bible where the family records used to be
And I knew it was the same sweet Mother that years ago had cradled me

I was dreaming of a little cabin when I heard somebody call my name
I looked and saw a sweet old lady and it seemed I was child agan
She gentry put her arms around me and kissed her little boy once more
And I knew it was the same sweet mother that had kissed me many times beforeDark shadows always were with me
I walked in the night all alone
My loneliness was my companion
A true friend I never had known

    Somewhere the lights are bright, dear
    And happiness waits there, I know
    Come, love, let us wander
    Down where the still waters flow

Then passed the dark and the shadows
A bright ray of sunlight shown down
So happy the day that I met you
We win the love found today

  

We walk hand in hand together
All worries and cares pass away
And now all my life has a meaning
To win the love found todayIt's hard to keep the tear out of my eyes
For this might be our last goodbye
Your country calls you to defend this great land
So do your part just like a man

    Down where the river bends
    With God's help we'll meet again
    Under the same old sycamore tree
    Proud of each other in the land of the free

I'll go down to the ocean blue
And get just as close as I can to you
Though the ocean wide may keep us apart
It won't keep you dear from out of my heart

  

If the worst should happen, and the poppies should wave
Over your far distant lonely grave
All the rest of my life I'll spend in rayer
I'll meet you in heaven, there'll be no warws thereWandering down the road of life
Wandering what's over the hill
Don't know what I'm searching for
Don't guess I ever will

Must I go thru hours of care
I wish I knew what lies over there
Wandering down the road of life
Wandering what's over the hillDown the road, down the road
    got a little pretty girl, down the road

Now down the road just a mile or two
There's a little girl named "purty blue"
Bout so high and her hair is broun
Purtiest thing, boy, in this town

  

Now anytime you want to know
Where I'm heading it's down the road
See that girl on the line
You'll find her there most any ol' time

  

Now everyday at sunday school
I go to see my purty blue
Before you hear that rooster crow
You'll see me headed down the road

  

Clearin' your eggs drawn over the farm
From the hogwalk through the barn
From the barn to the rail
Man is living by curling mailWe were waltzing in the light of the old Virginia moon
As the fiddles played thier music so low
I was happy as a king with the girl of my dream
Until she whispered sweetheart I must go

Oh, I'll never forget the night when we met
You found me when my heart was low
Now my heart will always yearn
'Til the day when you return
And we'll dance to the Old Virginia WaltzDown in thr willow garden where me and my love did meet
There we sat a-courting my love feel off to sleep
I had a bottle of burgundy wine which my true love did not know
And there I poisoned that dear little gir down on the bank below

I drew my saber through her which was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river which was an awful sight
My father often told me that money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl whose name was Rose Connelly

Now he sits in his cabin door wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
Mourning for his only son out on the scaffold high
My race is run benearth the sun the devil is waiting for me
For I did murder that dear little girl whose nane was Rose ConnellyDown in the valley the valley so low
Hang your head over and hear the wind blow
Little Willie's my darling little Willie's my dear
If you think I don't love her got a feelish idear
She wrote me one letter she sent it by mail
She sent it in care of the Washington jail
Gonna build me one steeple on the mountain so high
So I can see Willie passin' on by
She said that she loved me just to give my heart ease
Just as soon as my back was turned she loved who she pleased
I repped on her window I knocked on her do
She gave me short answer don't knock there no mo
Sitting in the prison with my back to the wall
Old corn whiskey was the cause of it all
The judge said Stand up George and dry up your tears 
You're sentenced to Raleigh for twenty two years
If I had of listened to what mother said
I'd a been there today boys in her feather bedIn the ahadow of the pain
There's a girl and I know she's mine
Life's worth living any time
Down in Caroline

    And no matter where I go
    She'll be waiting there I know
    And I'll find, girl of mine
    Down in Caroline

Curly hair, and eyes of blue
A heart of gold, that's all for you
And I know she is true
Down in Caroline

  

She is waiting there for me
Soon her smile of love I'll see
She's all mine when I can be
Down in Caroline

  

Arms that hold me close and tight
Lips that kiss me goodnight
A pair of eyes blue and bright
Down in CarolineDown at the end of Memory lane
Many have walked it in gladness
I was the one to walk it last
I walked it alone in sadness

I received a letter from my love
Opened it and this is what it said
I am sorry if I hurt you but now it is too late
For another man my darling I have wed

I remember her sweet smiling face
And her little freckled nose
And her golden hair hanging down her back
Tied with a big blue ribbon bow

We were childhood chums together there
I loved her with all my heart and soul
But she married another without a thought or care
And she left me in this world alone and cold

You have heard of the weeping willow
Of that weeping willow tree
And when I die I want you to bury me
Beneath that weeping willow tree

When I'm dead and buried love
Never no more in this world to see
There is one request grant me darling
Won't you see that my frave is kept cleanLittle sweetheart we have parted
For each other we must go
Many miles may separate us
In this world of care and woe
But I can't forget the promise
That you made me in the lane
When you said we'd be together
When the roses bloom again

Down among the budded roses
I am nothing but a stem
I have parted from my darling
Never more to meet again
But I treasure dear, you promise
That you'll meet me in the lane
Where we'll always be together
When the roses bloom again

Now this parting gives me sorrow
And it almost breaks my heart
Tell me darling will you love me
When we meet, no more to part
Or will this parting be forever
Will there be no coming day
When our hearts will be united
And all sorrows pass away

Darling, meet me up in heaven
That's my true and earnest prayer
If you love me here on earth dear
Then I'm sure you'll over me there
There our hearts will be united
Free from ever pain and care
In the land of life eternal
In that city bright and fairDon't you know that I love you Charlie Brown
I just lose my senses when you come around
With that little lock of hair that won't turn down
Don't you know that I love you Charlie Brown

Don't you know that I love you Charlie Brown
I think you're the cutest little boy in town
You're so bashful every time I come around
Let me get a little closer Chrlie Brown

If you'd just love me I wouldn't give a hoot
If all the other girls think you're so cute
I'm so jealous of them always hanging around
Don't you know that I love you Charlie Brown

Never grow up Charlie always be a boy
For you bring so many people so much joy
You're so funny even though you're not a clown
Don't you know that I love you Charlie BrownYou say you'll never be my wife cause you've done wrong in life
And from it all your heart is bruised and torn
But God will forgive you and darlin' I will too
But let me love you, Don't throw your life away

He used your heart for his fun now the damage has been done
Don't wish that you had never been born
For the mistake has been made your love's too sweet to waste away
But let me love you, Don't throw your life away

He treated you mean and cheap and your heart I know was deep
A rose you found was full of deadly thorns
He dragged your name beneath his feet and now he shuns you on the street
But let me love you, don't throw your life away

Come into my waiting arms, we'll fight life's bitter storms
My loving you I'm not sorry for
And if your love's not meant for me then wrong I'll always be
But let me love you, don't throw your life awayDarling, I have come to tell you
Though it almost breaks my heart
That before the morning, darling
We'll be many mils apart

    Don't this road look rough and rocky
    Don't that sea look wide and deep
    Don't my baby look the sweeter
    When she's in my arms asleep

Don't you hear the nightbirds calling
Far across the deep blue sea ?
While of others you are thinking
Won't you sometimes thinking of me ?

  

One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have cause me lost of trouble
Darling, you have broke my heart

  
�@�@There ain't no use in sitting and wondering why (Babe)
If you don't know by now
There ain't no use in sitting and wondering why (Babe)
It will never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice it's all right

There ain't no use in truning on your light (Babe)
The light I've never known
There ain't no use in turning on your light ( Babe)
I'm on the dark side of the road
Well, I wished there was something you would do or say
To try to make me change my mind and stay
We never did to much talking in the rain
Don't think twice it's all right

There ain't no use in calling up my name (Gal)
Like you've never done before
There ain't no use in calling up my name (Gal)
Cause I can't here you anymore
Well, I'm a thinking and a wondering walking down the road
How I just loved the woman her child I am told
I had given her my heart, but she wanted my soul
Don't htink twice it's all right

So long honey baby
Where I'm bound I can't tell
Goodbye to good word babe
So I'll just say fair the well
Now I ain't saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better, but I don't mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
Don't think twice it's all rightAll the things that we have done together
All the joys and sorrows that we've shared
Made me feel our love would last forever
Now I know you never really cared

    Don't step over an old love
    To get somebody new
    Don't step over an old love
    Who always has been true to you

When my back was turned he caught your fancy
And he turned an innocent affair
Into something more than just a friendship
While my dreams all crumbled in despair

 

Now you think you're happy with your new love
You don't think he's been untrue to you
Wait until you hear the whole town talking
Than you'll feel these heartaches like I doDon't sell the land, mama
    Please don't sell the land
    My heart's in these hills, mama
    please don't sell the land

My daddy he was born here, here in these hills
My daddy's lying quiet now but he's with us still
Mama, on your wedding day daddy brought you here
Held you safely in his arms and promised his last share

 

I'll help you pay the taxes, we still have some time
I'll farm that little furrow, I'll work down in the mine
I know how hard it is, mama, with eleven kids to feed
But we can still make it, mama, if you will hear my plea

 

Don't worry about my schooling don't need it anyhow
I've got to fill my daddy's shoes and I plan to start right now
I know you carried it all alone so, mama, lean on me
We've lost the most important thing but we built a familyYou tell me today that you're going
Far away just to make you a name
You tell me that you're descontented
And that you are searching for fame
Somehow I can't realize we're parting
I have grown used to having you near
The strings in my heart love are breaking
I just can't say goodbye to you dear

    Don't say goodbye if you love me
    For 'twould make my heart overflow
    Kiss my lips once 'ere you leave me
    Just don't say goodbye when you go

Each night I will kneel by my bedside
I will pray one sweet prayer just for you
I will ask of the kind one in heaven
Just to make all your dreams dear come true
If this love should be our last meeting
I will always love you just the same
I will keep a sweet memory of you
You will live in my heart like a flameYou pull the string, she's your plaything
You can make her or break her, it's true
You abuse her, accuse her, turn around and use her
Then forsake her any time it suits you

Well, there's more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided, bleached out hair
Well, if she acts that way, it's cause you had your day
Don't upt her down, you helped put her there

She hangs around playing the clown
While her soul is aching inside
She's heartbreak's child cause she just lives for your smile
To build her up in a world made by men
At the house sown the way, you sneak and you pay
For the love, her body, her shame
Then you call yourself a man, you say you just don't understand
How a woman could turn out that way

Well, there's more to her that power and paint
Than the men she picks up at the bar
Well, if she acts that way, it's cause you had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her thereNew York City years ago tourist in the rain
Singing on a swing shift for pennies
Thinking about the bayou, cajun river song
Almost got my broke in Texas

    It's been a long, long, long way
    I've go some more to go
    Don't look at my shadow, it's behind me
    It's been a long, long, long way
    Thirty-two years or so
    I'm thinking about my past quite amusing

Purple peacock, honky tonk, Eunice, Louisiana
Bourbon whisky free son just tune up the piano
Well I played in clubs in New Orleans
Bringing home a dollar
College boys drink beer throw the bottle

 

L.A.Forum, Sports Arena, 20,000 fans
I'm glad you've come to listen
I've got to give you everything I can
Well, I've always tried to play my music
I played it best I could
I hope you out there in the crowd can hear me good

 

You know California dreamin' Lord
It put me down for good
Colorado, Rocky mountains, saved my sensesDon't let your sweet love die like flowers in the fall
Don't take away the smiles and leave the tears
My heart believes in you, please say you love me true
Don't leave me now to face the lonely years

I drifted all alone, no one to call my own
And then you love me whin the rose buds open wide
You said we'd never part, don't leave and break my heart
Be mine alone, don't let your sweet love die

When flowers fade we say, they'll bloom again someday
Will you love me when the rose buds open wide
Or is your kiss to be only a memory
I need you, so don't let your sweet love die

Don't let your sweet love die like flowers in the fall
Without you, life would be like death to me
I've grown so used to you, I can't believe we're through
Don't say goodbye, don't your sweet love dieWell, I've been all around this whole wide world
Been down to sunny Alabam
My mama always told me, Son
Never let your deal go down

    Don't let your deal go down
    Don't let your deal go down
    Don't let your deal go down
    Till your last gold dollar is gone

Well, the last time I seen that gal of mine
She was standing in the door
She said Honey I'll be a long time gone
You'll never see your gal no more

  

Well, I'm going sown the railroad track
Gonna take my rocking chair
If there doggone blues don't leave my mind
I'm gonna run away from hereDon't let Smokey mountain smoke get in your eyes
    If you do I'm tellin' you
    You'll wan't to live there the rest of your life
    If Smokey mountain smoke gets in your eyes

If you're looking for a place you will love

Gattlinburg precious jewel the mountain treasure
Smokey mountain paradise

    I'm so lonesome while you're gone

I here a knockin' at my door
And a footstep on the floor
Now they're bringin' home my darling
Here he lies drunk upon the floor

  

Now he's dying, yes he's dying
Soon I'll be left all alone
I pray that God's won tender mercy
Will save him from a drunkard's doomDon't fall in love with me darling I'm rambler
    Although you the sweetest sweetheart in this world
    It's all for your sake dear that I'm leaving
    Don't give your heart to a rambler, little girl

I handed you a line and I'm sorry
You're just a little sweeter that the rest
Believe me when I say I don't want to hurt you
Or do anything to mar tour happiness

  

If I'd never had the blues, little darling
Or the lure of the road on my mind
But I'm bound to hear the whistle of a fraight train
And the boxcars as they rattle down the lineNow I got a gal thats sweet to me
She just ain't what she used to be
Just a little high hearded
Thats plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me

I ain't forgot what you used to be
When you didn't have nothing
That was plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay sown on earth with me

Now you need not hold your head so high
Every time you pass me by
For it don't mean nothing
To me you see
Don't get above your raising
Stay sown on earth with me

Now looky here gal you better be yourself
And leave that other stuff on the shelf
You're country baby

Some may tell you I'm not true
Don't believe them little darling
No one loves you as I doDon't do it won't be on your mind
    Just because you are the reckless kind
    It'll leave you with the blues the kind that you can't lose
    Don't do it and it won't be on your mind

If you're thinkin' about steppin' out tonight
Even tho' your baby treats you right
It's not the thing to do cause cheatin' leaves blue
Don't do it and it won't be on your mind

 

That little girl who lives across the way
She's bound to make you want to cheatr some day
You'll want to hold her tight, kiss her ruby lips goodnight
Don't do it and it won't be on your mindJust cry now lonesome heart, don't cry to me

You let her go I told you no
And my words you didn't heed

The pain you caused her you'll regret
Each day you're gonna miss
Her smile, her touch, her kissDon't bother to cry cause I ain't lookin'

    You told me a lie and I believed you
    Tho' you're cryin' you are still lying dear

Weep no more my lady
Oh, weep no more and moan
Save your teardrops baby
Cause your Daddy's lovin' heart has truned to stone

Don't tell me your lies if I should leave you
Don't pull at your hair it won't help at all
You did it before and fooled my heart dear
Now you might as well talk to the wall

Don't bother to cry cause I ain't lookin'
Don't bother to sigh cause I won't hear
I p;ayed the game fair but you've been cheatin'
As you sew, so you'll reap, so sorry dear

Weep no more my lady
Oh, weep no more and more
Save your teardrops baby
Cause your Daddy's lovin' heart has turned to stone

 * RefranIf our love should fade like a cold winter day
Don't blame it all on me
Their true love has flown, I have known friends will say
Don't blame it all on me
There was a time dear when we were so gay
I heard you say love only you
But some day with the dawn all our love may be gone
Don't blame it all on me

Now you left and know all our love is so wrong
Don't blame it all on me
For there was a time when our love was a song
Don't blame it all on me
For after all dear, I too have a heart
You have it now, don't break it apart
Someday our romance may break up just by chance
But don't blame it all on me

You just can't go on with no smile in your heart
Don't blame it all on me
Our freinds they all say that we too soon must part
Don't blame it all on me
Now if you'll cange dear, I will change too
And maybe then we'll find love anew
Someday with the dawn all our love may be gone
But don't blame it all on meOn this old pile with a ball and chain
They call be by a number not a name, lord, lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and worried mind

When that old judge looked down and smile
He said I'll put you on that good road for a while, lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind

You can hear my hammer you can hear my song
I'll swing it like john henly all day long, lord, lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind

It won't be long just few more days
I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways, lord, lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She'll be waiting for me when I've done my timeYou've been stepping out on me
I'm gonna leave 'em at your feet
You're no good but I don't care
Ain't that a shame a Dog gone shame

Every time I leave town
People say you're stepping round
You're no good but I don't care
Ain't that a shame a Dog gone shame

I'll set you in the shade
Give you everything I made
You're no good but I don't care
Ain't that a shame a Dog gone shame

I've done all that I can do
To try and get along with you
You're no good but I don't care
Ain't that a shame a Dog gone shame

Ain't that a shame a Dog gone shameI went downtown throught I had a dime
Got home this morning didn't have a dime
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy got the dog house blues
No use talking I got the dog house blues

Come home this morning about half past eight
She said honey you're out too late
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy got the dog house blues
No use tlking I got the dog house blues

I went in the house to start the fire
She kicked me out in the middle of the night
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy got the dog house blues
No use tlking I got the dog house blues

I feel in the yard mad as I can be
Said to my dog make room for me
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy got the dog house blues
No use tlking I got the dog house bluesNow, hnoney, you know you ain't living right
You sleep all day and you're gone all night
Dog bite your hide, little hide, dog bite your hide
Like a black cats back you're full of fire
You're always jumping here and there
Dog bite your hide, little hide, I hope you're satisfied

Now all the things that you have done
Has killed my soul, made my spirits run
Dog bite your hide, little hide, dog bite your hide
And if you don't stop your playing around
I'm gonna tear your ash hopper down
Dog bite your hide, little hide, then I'll be satisfied

Now, honey, you think that you're just it
Cause you made me have a running fit
Dog bite your hide, little hide, dog bite your hide
But my craw is full, I'm leavin' you
My gizzard's cracked, I'm feelin' blue
Dog bite your hide, little hide, then I'll be satisfied

I'm gonna tear your reputation down
Gonna cut a wide swath for miles around
Dog bite your hide, little hide, dog bite your hide
Then I'm gonna stand around and laugh
When you roll your eyes like a dying calf
Dog bite your hide, little hide, then I'll be satisfiedLast night I heard those nightbirds calling
Brings back memories of days gone by
It makes me think of you my darling
And do you wonder why

    Do you wonder why I love you
    After what you did to me
    Why oh why do I think of you
    But I do, It's plain to see

In all my dreams of our life together
I think of you and then I sigh
I just don't know what makes me love you
And do you wonder why

  

And now that we have parted strangers
We have said our last goodbye
I can't forget I love you truly
And do you wonder whyI'm dreaming tonight of Dixie
That's where I like to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day
In my Dixie home sweet home

    Oh the people here they just don't care
    I never saw the beat
    That road ashead is mighty long
    But it's Dixie Land for me

I was going back to my old home
In the mountains far away
The wild red roses smell so sweet
And the ripling waters play

  

Yes, city life is not for me
Or knowing where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mightly long
But it's Dixie Land for me

  
That road ahead is mighty long
But it's Dixie Land for meThere's a place in Dixie where I want to be
Friend's a-waiting there to welcome me
I'm a gonna see 'em when the sun goes down
In dear old dixie where I'll settle down

There'll be banjers a-playing on that old platform
A few kind faces with smiles so warm
We'll all shake hands and gather round
When I get back to Dixie and that old home town

There'll be Nunior Cha Yaw and Diddley too
Daddy, little Ralph and big Jack too
We'll all join hands and dance around
When I get back to Dixie and my old home town

There's a girl a-waiting at the old home place
A great big smile upon her face
I'm gonna marry her and build a home
And from dear old Dixie I'll never roamI come in this morning a quarter past eight
Expecting her nagging for gettin home late
But she didn't scold me ro tell me it's wrong
For I didn't see her, my sweetheart was gone

    Dirty sishes, dirty dishes, I'm losing my mind
    My baby done left me and traveled behind
    And now I'm so lonely, and lonely I'll be
    With no one to wash all my dishes for me

A note on the table and here's how it read
Now, you've been cheatin' that's all that she said
I just stood there bawling, the tears were in vain
For now I know she'll never believe me again

  

Now I never cheated, believe me it's true
Or broken a promise that I made to you
You'll never know just how happy I'll be
If you will come back and wash dishes for meDim light,thick smoke and loud loud music
    In the only kind of life you'll ever understand
    Dim light, thick smoke and loud loud music
    You'll never make a wife to a home body man

A home and little children means nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband that's true
You'd rather take a drink with the first guy you meet
And the only home you know in the club down the street

  

A drink and a listen to a honky tonk band
In the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Go on and have your fun you'll think you played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heartDig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
    Dig a hole in the cold, cold ground
    Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
    Just to lay little Lulie down

The first time I saw little Lulie
She was standing in the still house door
Brogan shose all in her hand
An her stockin' feet on the floor

  * Rerfrain

Wake up, wake up, little Lulie
And go get me my gun
I ain't no man for trouble
But I'll die before I'll run

  

Last time I saw little Lulie
She was standing on the banks of the sea
Two pistols strapped round her body
And a banjo on her knee

  

Wake up, wake up, little Lulie
What makes you sleep so sound
The highway robbers are comin
Gonna tear your playhouse downI just pulled on to the highway in my little foreign car
Well it's raining and the road is really bad
I never saw that big old diesel but I heard him hit the air
I've got a feeling that I might have made him mad

He closed the gap between us, pushed the pedal on the floor
He's makin' ninety in that big old diesel truck
I can hear the names he's calling me above the engine's roar
And the words won't be found in Webster's books

    There's a diesel on my tail a-making ninety miles an hour
    My reflection in my mirror is mightly pale
    I can hear St.Peter calling, I can almost smell the flowers
    Can this compact take the impact, there's a diesel on my tail

Well I'm huffin' and puffin' and I'm trying to make the grade
And I wish I had some pedals on this cart
And I'm slippin' and a-slidin' and afraid to touch the brake
For the two of us could never stand the jar

 

Well I'm slippin' and a-slidin' trying to hold it on the road
And I tell you I just got to win this race
While I'm tremblin' and a-shakin' he is pouring on the coal
So close that I can steal his licence plateIt's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the hometown a million miles away
Is the ice still in the river are the old folks still teh same
And by the way, did she mention my name

Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the hometeam still on fire do they still win all the games
And by the way, did she mention my name

Is the landlord still the looser do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girl still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way, did she mention my name

Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high did the look in her eye seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the snow turns to rain
And by the way, did she mention my nameWhile walking out one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we gave the show
I met a little salvation band
Singing with all its might
I gave my heart to Jesus
And left the show that night

    The day will soon be over
    And degging will be done
    And no more gems be gathered
    So let us all press on
    Till Jesus comes to claim us
    And says it is enough
    The diamonds will be shining
    No longer in the rough

While reading through the Bible
Some wondrous sights I see
I read of Peter, James and John
By the Sea of Galilee
And Jesus when he found them
He found them very tough
And they were precious diamonds
He gathered in the rough

�@I once dressed up and went to town
To court a fair young lady
I inquired about her name
Her name was Devilish Mary

    Come a-fa-la-ling
    Come a-ling, come l-ling
    Come a-fa-la-ling
    Come a dairy, come a dairy

Me and Mary began to spark
She got all in hurry
She made it up all in her mind
She'd marry the very next Thursday

  

We had not been married for about two weeks
Before we ought to been parted
I hadn't said but a single word
She kicked up her heels and startedDevil's little Angel please leave me alone
Don't make me love you know that it's wrong
Devil's little Angel please go away
For I'd only love you more each day

    I'll love you my darling as long as I live
    If I could but hold you oh what would I give
    Devil's little Angel you must be unkind
    For God don't make Angels true love can't find

You can't understand my feeling for you
I know you'd be honest if you really knew
The torture I'm suffering God only knew
So if you don't love me please let me goLast night I went to sleep in the Detroit city
I dreamed about those cotton fields back home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for so long

    I want to go home I want to go home
    Lord, how I want to go home

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit city
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars and by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines

  * Rerain

Cause you know I rode a frieght train north to Detroit city
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I think I'll just take my foolish pride and put it
On the southbound freight and raid
And go on back to the loved ones the ones I left waiting so far behindDesperade, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out riding fences so long now
Oh you're ahard one
And I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you
Can hurt you some how

Don't you drive, the Queen of Diamond boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Another Queen of Hearts is always your best pet
Now seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can get

Desperade, you ain't getting up young
You're painting you're hunger
They're driving you on
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talking
Your present is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't show and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
And funny how the feeling goes the way

Desperade, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences open the gate
It may be raining but these's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
you better let somebody love you
Before it's too lateOld freind, you've been gone too long
Yesterday I sang one of your songs
Well and it made me remember
LIke a boit out of the blue
First there's life and then there's you
I love you

Deeper and deeper as time hurries by
Steeper and steeper the paths of our lives
Where we are going and where we have been
All of us waiting ot come back again

And when I see you again
We'll speak the words that are spoken by freinds
How are you, well missed you
But not until you're gone away
Will find the words to say
I love youLet it rain, let it pour
Let it rain a whole lot more
Cause I got them deep river blues

Let it rain, drive right on
Let the waves sweep along
Cause I got them deep river blues

My old gal's a good old pal
And she looks like a water flow
When I get them deep river blues

There ain't no one to cry for me
And the fish all go out on a spree
When I get them deep river blues

Give me back my lok boat
I'm gonna sail if she'll float
Cause I got them deep river blues

I'm going back to Muscle Shoals
Times are better there I'm told
Cause I got them deep river blues

If my boat sinks with me
I'll go down donl't you see
Cause I got them deep river blues

Now I'm gonna say goodbye
And if I sink just let me die
Cause I got them deep river bluesSoon one morning, death came creeping in my room
Soon one morning, death came creeping in my room
Soon one morning, death came creeping in my room
Oh, my Lord, what shall I do ( I do )

Death's done come and took my Mother away
Death's done come and took my Mother away
Death's done come and took my Mother away
Oh, my Lord, what shall I do ( I do )

Death's done come and took my Father away
Death's done come and took my Father away
Death's done come and took my Father away
Oh, my Lord, what shall I do ( I do )

Ride on, Death, 'cause you can't do me no harm
Ride on, Death, 'cause you can't do me no harm
Ride on, Death, 'cause you can't do me no harm
Oh, my Lord. what shall I do ( I do )At the end of day when works all over
And the shadows of night settle down
My thoughts turn back to the one that loved me
My sweetheart and my home town

    There's a dear one, dear one waiting
    Waiting back in my home town
    It's a sweet one called my missess
    Waiting back in my home town

We once walked to church on Sunday morning
All of our friends gathered round
I will meet her again to be wed at the altar
When I get back to my home townThere's a low green valley by the old Kentucky shore
Where we've whiled many happy hours away
A-sitting and a-singing by the little cottage door
Where lived my darling Nelly Gray

    Oh my poor Nelly Gray, they have taken you away
    And I'll never see my darling any more
    I'm a-sitting by the river and I'm weeping all the day
    For you're gone from the old Kentucky shore

One night I went to see her but "she's gone" the neighbors say
The white man bound her with his chain
They have taken her to Georgia to wear her life away
As she toils in the cotton and the caneWake up, wake up, darling Corey
    What makes you sleep so sound
    The revenue officers are coming
    They're fonna tear your still-house down

Well the first time I seen darling Corey
She was sitting by the banks of the sea
Had a forty-four around her body
And a five-string on her knee

  

Go away, go away darling Corey
Quit hanging around my bed
Your liquor has urined my body
Pretty women gone to my head

  

Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
Dig a hole in the cold damp ground
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
We're gonna lay darling Corey down

  

Can't you hear them bluebirds a-singing
Don't you hear that mournful sound
They're preaching darling Corey's funeral
In some lonesome graveyard groundThe moon was shining last night
You're many miles from my side
As the train rolls on I'm thinkin' of home
And my little darlin' brown eyes

    My little darlin' don't cry
    You're little darlin' brown eyes
    You're mine you're mine to love all the time
    You're my little darlin' brown eyes

The train was on the fly
I watched the stars in the sky
The break of dawn and the hills of home
You're my little darlin' brown eyes

I've come back darlin' brown eyes
I've come back darlin' don't cry
Back to stay, never to stray
You're my little darlin' brown eyesThe sun is slowly sinkin'
The day's almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on

The sun is slowly sinkin'
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet
The darkest hour is just before dawn

Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A'watchin' the sheep down below
He's coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go

The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul
Let Jesus in
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The darkest hour is just before dawnA dark road's a hard road to travel
A light road is always the best
A dark road will lead you to trouble
A light road will lead you to rest

I'm going to see my new jail tomorrow
It's a place I have never been before
And when my woman comes tomorrow
I'll meet her with a smile at the door

Don't ever be downhearted
Where there's a will there's a way
Tomorrow the sun may be shining
Although it is cloudy today

Don't this road look dark and lonesome
Don't the sea look blue and deep
Will you ever think of me darling
When you can not hear me speakI'd rathere be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't never shine
That to be all alone and far away from home
It would cause me to lose my mind

    So blow your whistle fright train
    Carry me father on down the track
    For I'm going away I'm leaving today
    I'm going but I ain't coming back

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't never shine
That to be lord in some big city
In a small room with you on my mindDark as the night and blue as the day
I'm lonesome my darling since you went away
Sometimes I wander what Made you stray
Dark as the night and blue as the day

Blue as the sky there's blues in my heart
Yes it's dark outside since we've been apart
Oh, tell me please tell me why you betray
Dark as the night I'm blue as the dayCome listen you fellows so young and fime
Oh seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal

    It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
    Where the danger is double and the pleasures are few
    Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
    It's dark as a dungeon waydown in the mines

It's a-many a man I've known in my day
Who lived just to labor his life away
Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

  

The midnight, the morning, or the middle of the day
It's the same to the miner who labors away
Where the demons of the death often come by surprise
One fall of the slate and youa7re buried alive

  

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner a-digtgin' my bonesWasn't he a big one boys
    Wasn't he a big one boys
    Wasn't he a big one boys
    Before they cut him down

This old ram he had a horn
It reached up to the moon
A man went up in January
And he never got back 'til June

Well the wool that growed on that ram's back
Reached up to the sky
Eagles built their nest in it
For I heard the young ones cry

 

My daddy had a ol' buck sheep
And then you heard him say
One of the finest ram's sir
And every foot he had sir
That ever fed on hay

He had four feet ot walk sir
And he had four feet to stand
And every foot he had sir
Would cover and acre of land

 

Now the butcher man that cut him down
Was washed away in the blood
And the little boy that filled the bowl
Was drowned away in the floodMy pocket book was empty
My heart was full of pain
Ten thousand miles away from home
Bumming the railroad train

It was standing on the platform
Smoking a cheep cigar
listening for that nwxt freight train
To carry an empty car

Well I got off at Danville
Got stuck on the Danville girl
You bet your life she's out of sight
She wore those Danville curls

She took me in her Kitchen
She treated me nice and kind
She got me in the notion
Of bumming all the time

She wore her hair on the back of her head
Like high-tone people do
But the vetry next train come down the line
I bid that girl adieu

I pulled my cap down over my eyes
Walked down to the track
Then I caught a westbound greight
Never did look backThere's a pathway of darkness there's a pathway of bright
And they meet at the old crossroads
The Angels are calling if your spirit will hearken
All is forgiven,lay down your weary load

    You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing with the Angels
    Just like old Danyel in the Lions den
    The door will be open and the feastspead out before you
    Dancing with the Angels while the Lions lord

Old Saian's dark powers are hungry for confusion
Unsatisfyed ever greedy for more
If you look to your heart at the spirit there a blooming
If it's bright and shining sun can harm you no more

  

King Angels of mercy are waiting there to greet you
Standing on the shoes of ever lasting light
They saying come and join us across the shining water
Our lanterns of love will guide us though the nightOh Daisy Mae my darling, oh Daisy Mae
When I'm with you my darling all my cares away
And don't you know sweet heart that I love you so
Cause you're my darling precious Daisy Mae

So nice and neat your kisses, so very sweet
In my opinion darling you just can't be beat
And now that I've found yu no one else will ever do
I've tried to make you happy Daisy Mae

You're everthing you're evry song that I sing
Your lovely little hadn looks lovely with that ring
It won't be long till we hear that wedding song
And you'll be mine all mine Miss Daisy Mae

How can I wait till we have this final date
And we'll be married darling that will seal our fate
But laying jokes aside you'll make a wonderful bride
And I'll be proud of you my Daisy MaeThe curtains of sorrow have descended
O'er my world like the shades of the night
Alone with my memories I wander
I am lost Dear with no guiding light

Oh where is the moon that shown so brightly
And where are the stars that spell love
Where are the blue skies that linger
That smile from the heavens above

You've broken my heart Dear forver
I don't seem to care now or try
My future seems dark and so dreary
I can't keep the tears from my eyes

There's a curtain of sorrow O'er the moonbeams
There's a shade of gray sky up above
The starlignt has lost all its splendor
And I've lost the sweetherart I loveMe and my wife and my wife's pap
We all live down in Cumberland Gap

    Cumberland Gap, Cumberland Gap
    Mmm  ,way down yonder in Cumberland Gap

Cumberland Gap is a noted place
Three kinds of water to wash your face

  

The first white man in Cumberland Gap
Was Doctor Walker, an English chap

  

Daniel Boone on Pinnacle Rock
He killed Injuns with his old flintlock

  

Lay down, boys, and take a little nap
Fo'teen miles to the Cumberland GapOut somewhere the music is playing soft and low
And a stranger hold the one that I love so
I was blind I could not see that you mean the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go

    Now I'm crying my heart out over you
    Those blue eyes now they smile at someone new
    Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
    For I'm crying my heart out over you

Each night I climb the stair up to my room
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom
I miss your picture on the wall and your footsteps in the hall
While I'm crying my heart out over youCrying holy unto the Lord
    Crying holy unto the Lord
    Lord, if I could I surely would
    Stand on the rock where Moses stood

Lord, I ain't no stranger now
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
I've been introduced to the Father and the Son
Lord, I ain't no stranger now

  

Sinners run hide your face
Sinners run hide your face
Sinners run to the Lord and hide your face
Lord cried out " No hiding place "Crying the blues
I'm crying because I have lost you
Blues I can't lose
I guess it's too late now to try
I've tried to chose another to love but it's no use
Crying heart blues, there's nothing that's left but to cry

I'll always remember I love you
My teardrops won't let me forget
Each tear is a wish to be near you
They started the day that we met
A trail of tears will lead you to me if you want me
And from my hopeless my crying heart fleesCry cry darling,that what I'll do
If you should leave me with the blues
Cry cry darling,that all I do
Cause you're the one that's in my heart
For me there'll be no moonlight
If ever we should part
Cry cry darling,that's all I do
Cause you're the one that's in my heart

Cry cry darling,my eyes will cry
And never dry if you should go
Cry cry darling,when shadows creep
I'm just weep all night I now
You know how much I'd miss you
If ever we should part
Cry cry darling,that's all  I do
Cause you're the one that's in my heart
�@I got a girl and she loves me

I heard the duck say to the drake
There ain't no crawdads in this lake
Honey, sugar baby, mineYou can tell I'm from the country
See I'm from out of town
But I'm begining to catch on
I'm letting muy hair down 
I've been a rocking, I've been a rolling
I guess to some folks I look foolish
Just let it make a fool out of me

I have worked in fields of cotton
I have worked in fields of corn
But I've seen nothing like it
Since the day that I was born
I've been a rocking, I've been a rolling
I guess to some folkes I look foolish
Just let it make a fool out of me

I walked in a crowded dance hall
And I didn't know a soul
Some hillbillies, started picking
Everybody rocked and rolled
I've been rocking, I've been a rolling
I guess to some folks I look foolish
Just let it make a fool out of me

I have spent all the egg money
Corn and cotton I have sold
I'll mortgage my old homestead
Stay in town to rock and roll
I've been a rocking, I've been a rolling
I guess to some folks, I look foolish
Just let it make a fool out of meCome all you good time people
While I have money to spend
Tomorrow might be a monday
And I neither have a dollar of friend

When I have plenty of money
My freinds were all standing around
Just as soon as my pocket book was empty
Not a friend on earth to be found

I wrote my woman a letter
I told her I's in jail
She wrote me back an answer
Saying honey I must come to go your bail

All around this old jailhouse is haunted
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my bady
Pretty womans a-troublin' my mind

For if you don't quit your drinkin'
Sometime you'll be just like me
A workin' out your livin'
In the penitentiary

When I'm dead and buried
And my pale face turned to the sun
You can come around and mourn little woman
And think of what you've doneCould you love me one more time
With love that really is mine
We've waiting so long
They say you've gone wrong
Have I lost you forever this time

Do you think that I belive
There's talk that's going around
I've heard lost of things
That some have seen strange
But darling I wouldn't throw you down

We'll go down by the river
I'll ask you one last time
As the night breezes blow
I'll whisper so low
Could you love me one more time

I know that you're my weakness
I know you'll be my downfall
I'm not sorry we met
And I'll never forget
Though I gave you my heart soul & all
Could you love me one more timeDoyou rememner a long time ago
There was a man called Cotton eyed Joe
There was a man called Cotton eyed Joe

I could have been married a long time ago
If it hadn't a-been for Cotton eyed joe
If it hadn't a-been for Cotton eyed joe

Old bull fiddle and a shoes-string bow
Wouldn't play nothing, but Cotton eyed Joe
Wouldn't play nothing, but Cotton eyed Joe

Play it fast or play it slow
Didn't play nothing but Cotton eyed Joe
Didn't play nothing but Cotton eyed Joe

Don't you remember and long time ago
Daddy worked and a man called Cotton eyed Joe
Daddy worked and a man called Cotton eyed Joe

Where do you come from ? Where do you go ?
Where do you come from Cotton eyed Joe
Where do you come from Cotton eyed Joe

Come for to see you , come for to sing
Come for to show you my diamond ring
Come for to show you my diamond ringCorinna, Corinna, Where you been so long?
Corinna, Corinna, Where you been so long?

Corinna, Corinna, why'd you leave me alone?
Corinna, Corinna, got no place to call my own

Corinna, Corinna, bye-bye, so long
Corinna, Corinna, bye-bye, so long

Corinna, Corinna, bye-bye, so long
I'll have the blues, Corinna, long as you goneThe winds through the night is blowing so lonesome
Singing to me a song
A whippoowill call is just a reminder
Pretty girls have hearts made of stone

    I'll wake with the blues at dawn
    My darling Cora is gone
    I don't know why she told me goodbye
    But my darling Cora is gone

The ring that she wears I bought for her finger
Purchased her raiments so fine
Gave her my last green back dollar
And now she's left me behind

  

Drifting alone like brush on a river
Caring not where I roam
Going to live in the deep forest
Dark hollow will be my new homeCome walk with me down lover's lane
Where we once walked together
For old time sake I'm asking of you dear
Then I'll go away forever

    I think of the life we could have together
    And relive the past they wouldn't make last
    So come walk with me down lovers lane
    Then I'll go away forever

This little band of gold I'll keep it forever
As a token of a love that never could be
It's the story of my life the past with no future
And all that is left is a sad memorySow in the garden, sow in the sand
Sow making love to a walleyed man
Fire in the mountain come here son
Sal let me chew your rosin son

Two little Indians one old squaw
Sitting on a rock in Arkansas
Fire in the mountain come here son
Fire in the mountain run boy run

Hold my fiddle and hold my bow and
I'll slap heck out fo cotton eye Joe
Fire in the mountain come here son
Sal let me chew your rosin son

I've got candy, I've got gum
Sal let me chew your rosin son
Come here son, come here son
Sal let me chew your rosin sonCome go with me to yonder valley
Where we once stood beneath the tree
Where we once planned our life together
I can't forget, come go with me

Come let us live some moments over
Then maybe you won't want to leave
I love you then and will forever
I can't forget, come go with me

    I can't forget the flowers blooming
    The roese that I pick for you
    Time changed you but I'm not changing
    I loved you then and I still do

Come go with me to yonder valley
Where all the
I'll carve your mane to prove I love you
I can't forget, come go with me

  

I love yo then and I still doOh, I'm sending a prayer up to Heaven
On a beautiful cloud you see
So you will know that I want you
In my beautiful memories and dreams

    Come back to me in my dreams love
    Come back to me in sweet dreams
    I'm heartbroke I'm sad and I'm weary
    Come back to me in my dreams

When the bright moon shines up in Heaven
And the beautiful stars are a'gleam
It seems that you are so near me
But yet it is only a dream

  

It seems I'll never more see you
Till we meet in Heaven it seems
But I hold you close to my heart love
In my beautiful memories and dreamsTonight as you sit by my wondow
I'm reading your letter so true
I'm hoping to find it in your letter
Where you say I'll come back to you

    Oh come back to me little darling
    I miss you each day and each night
    Oh come back to me little darling
    Don't leave me alone all my life

I know I can never be happy
No matter whatever I do
I know its harsh and lonely without you
Oh won't you come back and be true

  

Oh, what will I do without you
My life is so lonely and blue
No matter what happens my darling
I just can't forget loving youI could see that you're ready to go home
There's some TV shows that you're missing
But you know how an old love loves to talk
And he needs someone who will listen

    Come and sit by the river with me for a while
    And I'll tell you a story that's true
    Of when I was a boy playing here on the shore
    And the grass was so green and the water so blue

Well our house stood right over there
Of course they took it down for the highway
I can see my moma's tears, we've been there for twenty years
And you know we would still if I had my way

In those days you could often find me here
With the rest of the nieghborhood children
There was so much we could do, there was fishin' swimmin' too
There was always some raft that we were building

 

Many years I have watched this river flow
Rolling down from the hills to the ocean
I have seen the waters high, almost fierce and rushing by
I have seen in nearly dry and without motion

Now at last you can see what it has come to
Oh we prospered but poisoned the waters
Now the turnes have all been played and the piper must be paid
Not by us but our sons and daughtersCome all you tender hearted
Your attention I will call
I'll tell you how it started
Come listen one and all

Last Wednesday night, there was a light
Seen shining on a hill
A mother and with all her might
While every thing was still

She went into a neighbors house
Some hundred yards away
She set down to tolk to them
But she did not mean to stay

Don't stay too long dear mother there
For we'll be lonesome here
I'll get some liniment she said
Then I'll return again

But when she started home again
Her house was in a flames
She cried Oh Lord my babies are gone
And I'm the one to blame

She cried alas how sad they sleep
Wrapped up in a red hot flame
She bursted all asunder then
And the flames rolled over her head

Her little ones lay on the ground
They both lay face to face
Each other did entwine
Each other did enbraceWay down in Columbus, Georgia
What to be back in Tennessee
Way down in Columbus Stockade
Friends have turned their backs on me

    Go and leave me if you wish to
    Never let me cross your mind
    In your heart you love another
    Leave me darling, I don't mind

Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreaming that you were in my arms
Then I found I was mistaken
I was peeping through the barsThere is blood upon the mountain
And the wind is rising higher
Plunging through the darkness
Colly Davis makes his way
There's a dead girl left behind him
And he swears they'll never find him
Though he's lost his knife and lighter
In the brush along the way

Now a light rain start a falling
Like the sound of voices calling
They found her car back off the road
With Sally Jean inside
And the word goes to her cousins
That it's time to go out hunting
But the sheriff wants to stop us
So you'd best just take a knife

    They work back from the police
    Cause they know he wants to reach there
    But this ain't police business
    Up on White Oak Hill tonight
    It's their own he left behind him
    It's their own know how to find him
    And he'll never hear a footstep
    And he'll never see a light

Colly Davis runs the mountain
And he twisits his foot and cries out
And curses in the darkness
And turns at every sound
There's a blue police light flashing
On the higher ground above him
But it might as well be Heaven
With her kinfolk all around

Now the sheriff wants some coffee
And he tells the men to call him
But they nod to each other
That the killer got away
And the sheriff he just glances
He knows they'll never answer
Oh where  is Colly Davis
And his shallow mountain graveSome blues are just blues, mine are the miner's blues
Some blues are just blues, mine are the miner's blues
My troubles keep coming by threes and by twos

Blues and more blues, it's that coal black blues
Blues and more blues, it's that coal black blues
Got coal in my hair, got coal in my shoes

There blues are so blue, they  are the coal black blues
There blues are so blue, they  are the coal black blues
For my place will cave in, and my life I will lose

You say they are blues, there old miner's blues
You say they are blues, there old miner's blues
Now I must have sharpened these picks that I use

I'm out with these blues, dirty coal black blues
I'm out with these blues, dirty coal black blues
We'll lay off tomorrow with the coal miner's bluesYou've gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bossom
Then I feel that you're close by

Years your passed, you've not returned, dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by

I saw you last while you were leavin'
the tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said, dear
Your memory I keep close by

They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
there I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close byLivin' up on top of the mountain
Livin' up where the hills are steep
Got no home, ain't got no place to sleep
Got no place to sleep

    Roll on, roll on, Clinch Mountains
    Roll on you old Clinch Mountain blues
    I can't lose these Clinch Mountain blues
    These Clinch Mountain blues

Goin' back to mother and daddy
Goin' back to see them both someday
When I'm there, it's there that I'll stay
There that I will stay

  

Travellin' down this old rocky road
Travellin' down this road to wend my way
Back to the old folks and my home so gay
My home so gay

  

Leavin' right now, yes, I'm leavin'
Packin' up clothes but I've none to pack
Leave these Clinch Mountains, and I ain't a-comin' back
I ain't a-coming backI am going to that city where the lights are hanging high
I am going to where no troubles can come
Will you meet me there my father in the city that lies four square
And we'll all live together over there

I can see the pearly gates open, I can see my Saviour's hand
I can hear his tender voice calling come
Come up here my little children to the city that lies four square
And we'll all live together over there

I am going to that city where the lights are hanging high
I am going where no troubles can come
Will you meet me there my mother in the city that lies four square
And we'll all live together over there

I am going to the city where the lights are hanging high
I am going where no troubles can come
Will you meet me there my children in the city that lies four square
And we'll all live together over there

I am going to that city where the lights are hanging high
I am going where no troubles can come
Will you meet me there my Saviour, in the city that lies four square
And we'll all live together over thereRiding on the City of New Orleans, Illinois Central Monday Morning Rail
Got fifteen cars, fifteen restless riders
Three conductors, twenty five sacks of mail
Well all out on southbound odyssey as the train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolling past the houses, farms and fields
Passing towns that have no name and freightyards full of old black men
And graveyards of rusted automobiles

(*)
Singing, Good Morning America, how are you ?
Yeah don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone 500 miles when day is done

Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
And it's a penny a point there ain't no-one's keeping score
Oh won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
You can hear the wheels a-rumblin through the flow
And the sons of Pullman porters and the song of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steam
And the mothers with their babes asleep, go rockin'to the gentle beat
The rhythm of the rails is all they dream
(*)
Midnight on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
We're halfway home We'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling to the sea
And then all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
Old steel rail it ain't heard the news
Conductor sings his song again, the passengers will please refrain
Well this train's got the disappearing railroad blues
(**)
Singing, goodnight America, how are you ?
Hey don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone a long long time when day is done
(**)I wish I was an apple a-hanging on a tree
And every time that Cindy passed she'd take a bite

    Get along home Cindy, Cindy
    Get along home
    Get along home Cindy, Cindy
    I'll marry you some day

She told me that she loved me, she called me sugar plum
She throwed her arms around me, I thought my time had come

 

She took me to the parlor, she cooled me with her fan
She swore that I was the prettiest little thing in the shape of mortal man

 

Oh where did you get your liquor, where did you get your dram?
From an old moon-shiner down in Rockingham

 

Cindy got religion she had it once before
And when she heard my old guitar, she danced all over the floor

 

I wish I had a needle as fine as I could sew
I'd sew my sweetheart to my back and down the road I'd goYou ought to see my cindy
She lives way down aouth
She's so sweet the honey bees
Swarm around her mouth

    Get aloneg home, Cindy, Cindy
    Get aloneg home, Cindy, Cindy
    Get aloneg home, Cindy, Cindy
    I'll marry you some day

The first I seen my Cindy
She was standing in the door
Her shoes and stocking in her hand
Her feet all over the floor

  

She took me to her parlor
She cooled me with her fan
She said I was the prettiest thing
In the shape of the floor

  

She kissed me and ahe hugged me
She called me suger plum
She throwed her arms around me
I thought my time had come

  

Oh, Cindy is a pretty girl
Cindy is a peach
She threw her arms around my neck
And hung on like a leech

  

And if I was a sugar tree
Standing in the town
Easy time my Cindy passed
I'd shake some sugar down

  

And if had a needle and thread
Fine as I could sew
I'd sew that gal to my coat tails
And down the road I'd go

  

I wish I was an apple
A-hanging on a tree
Every time that Cindy passed
She'd take a bite a of meChristmas time's a coming
    Christmas time's a coming
    Christmas time's a coming
    And I know I'm going home

Can't you hear them bells
A ringing, ringing
Joy to all oh hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going
Back to my country home

  

Snow flakes a falling
My old home's a calling
Tall pines a humming
Christmas time's a coming

  

Candle lights a burning
My old heart's a yearning
Not far from the homeland
Christmas time's a coming

  

Holly in the window
Home where the wind blows
Can't walk for running
Christmas time's a comingOur Christmas reunion, always in the past
Was something in our hearts so dear
A like in the chain will be missing this year
Our sorrow will be hard to bear

The family will gather at home as before
For that's what you'd want us to do
Our Christmas reunion, this year will be sad
Only God knows how much we'll miss you

Your place by the fireside will look so alone
With you not in your rocking chair
We'll miss the sweet smile and the touch of your hand
At our Christmas reunion this year

We'll pray for the courage to smile and pretend
That you're back with us again
Our Christmas reunion we'll have as before
Your memory will never grow dimThere's a quiet and peaceful county in the state of Tennessee
You will find it in the book they call Geography
Not famous for its farming, its mines, or its stills
But they know there's chittlin' cookin' in them cheatham county hills

    When it's chittlin' cookin' time in cheatham county
    I'll be courtin' in them cheatham county hills
    And I'll pick a cheatham county chittlin' cooker
    I've a longin' that the chittlin's will fill

There's an art in chittlin' cookin' and all good chittlin cookin' cooks
Can only be mastered by practice cause it ain't wrote down in books
In the hills of cheatham county in sunny Tennessee
When chittlin's are in season is where I long to be

Of all good things there could be for me
I think chittlin's are the best
And when I press that dying pillow
Let chittlin's by my last requestOUt on the mountain so happy and free
There lives a maid and she's waiting for me
Out on the lake we'll drift with the tide
And hear those chime bells ring

    Oh, chime bells are ringing
    Yodel--O--Hoo-Dee--
    Mocking Birds singing
    Dee--Oh--Oo--Oh--Oo--Oh--Oo--Hee
    Sleep my little lover
    Oh--Dee--Oloho--Dee
    Upon a summer's eve

Moonbeams were shining as I kissed her there
Night-birds were singing Perfume filled the air
Each little star just twinkled with glee
While Heaven smiled on meMama sent me to the spring, she told me not to stay
I fell in love with a pretty little girl, and could not get away

    Chewing chawin' gum, chawin' chewing gum
    Chawin' chewing gum, chweing chawin' gum

First she gave me peaches nice, next she gave me pears
And then she gave me fifty cents, and kissed me on the stairs

 

I won't have a lawyer man, I'll tell you the reason why
Each time he opens up his mouth, he tells a great big lie

 

I won't have a doctor man, I'll tell you the reason why
He rides the country over and he makes the people die

 

I took my gal to the preacher, and what do you reckon she done
She walked up to that minister a-chawin' chewing gumDon't go so far away love, try to settle down
    For losing you would be more than I could bear
    Tho' I'm tied to another, I hope someday she'll set me free
    For I don't want a cheap love affair

I knew we loved each other the night that we first met
It just happened there was nothing we could do
Let me stay with my children til they can understand
That I love them and they'll know I love you too

  

So darling please forgive me, don't give me all the blame
Tho' I know that it doesn't seem so fair
When I'm free I'll make you happy if you'll only wait for me
But I don't want a cheap love affairRich girl lives in a big brick house
Poor girl she does the same
My gal lives in the Nashville jail
It's a brick house just the same

    She'll be coming round the mountain Charmin Betsy
    She'll be coming round the mountain Cora Lee, poor thing
    And if I never see you again
    Good gal remember me

Rich girl rides in a Cadilac Eight
Poor girl she does the same
My gal rides in a T-Model Rord
But she gets there just the same

  

Rich girl wears the best perfume
Poor girl she does the same
My gal don't wear no perfume at all
But she gets there just the same

  

Rich girl wears a satin dress
Poor girl she does the same
My gal wears a burlap bag
But she gets there just the sameYou should get a medal dear for every broken heart
For every life you've ruined cause you think your so smart
I never even had a chance and now my life is lost
Once more you've had your fun and you don't care how much it cost

    Chalk up another one, another broken heart
    Chalk up another one, a heart you tore apart
    You picked me for a fool my dear how well played the part
    Chalk up another one, another broken heart

Broken vows and shattered dreams mean little dear to you
Cause once you said you love me and now vou say were thru
All is fair in love and war I guess you showed me so
Cause in this crazy game of love you hit a all time low

  

I have only pity for this evil life you choose
This fun filled game playing where everyone must lose
Well let me tell you something one day you won't forget
Add me to your collection and you'll wish we never metthere's a fairground down in Chattanooga
Where a kiddie train runs up and down the track
There's an old black hound with his tongue hanging down
And he chases the train down the track

    I've been chasing you like a Chattanooga Dog
    Even tho' I know you don't care
    I've been chasing you like a Chattanooga Dog
    And it ain't a-gonna get me nowhere

I've been thinking that you're just like that old train
If anybody gets a ticket they can ride
I'm like that hound pup, I won't never give up
I'll do anythihg to sleep by your side

 

Everyday when the kiddies come for playing
To ride that old kiddie train once more
There's an old faithful hound that always hangs around
And he runs 'til his feet get soreLet me dream of another morning
And the time so long ago
Where the sweet magnolias blossom
Cotton's fields as white as snow
Catfish john was a river hobo
Lived and dieon the river bend
Looking back I still remember
I was glad to be his friend

    Mama said don't go near that river
    Don't be hangin'around old catfish john
    Come the morning I'll always be there
    Walking in his footsteps in the sweet delta down

Born a slave in the town of pittsburg
Traded for a chestunt mare
Still he never spoke in angel
Though his love is hard to bareGot in a trouble at the country seat
Lawd, they put me in the jail house for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict I was a guilty man
He said forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can

that'll be cash on the barrelhead son
You can take your choice you're tewnty-one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you cause I'm a busy man

Found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good hearted jailer with a six gun hip
He let me call long distance , she said number please
And no sooner than I told her, she shouted out at me

That'll be cash on the barrelhead son
Not part not half but the entire sum
No money down, no credit plan
Cause a little bird told me , you're a travelin' man

Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming stuck up my thumb
Just as I was being seated, the driving caught my arm

Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead son
This old gray dog gets paid to run
When the evening starts, lawd, the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead I'll take you down the roadCome all you rounders for I want you to hear
The story of a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder's name
On an eight six-wheeler, boys, he won his fame
Now the caller called Casey 'bout half-past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He mounted to the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said; "I'm gonna take my trip to the promised land"

    Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
    Casey Jones with his orders in his hand
    Casey Jones mounted to the cabin
    Said;"I'm gonna take tke my trip to the promised land

Pour on the water boys, shobel on the coal
Stick your head out the window, see the drivers roll
Gonna run her 'til she leaves the rail
'Cause I'm nine hours late with the western mail
Now Casey passed out of South Menphis on the fly
Heard the firemane say " Boy, you got a white-eye "
The switchman knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones

 

Now Casey got to that certain place
Old number nine stared him straight in the face
He said to fireman " Boy, you better jump
Cause there's two locomotives and they're bound to bump"
Well, Mrs.Casay Jones, she sat there on the bed
She got the telegram that her poor husband was dead
She said; "Go to bed children, and hush your crying
'Cause you got another paper on the Salt Lake line"Carry me back to the mountains
    Back neath the southern sky
    Lay me to rest in the mountains
    There's where my sweetheart lies

I get so lonesome and weary
No matter where I roam
So carry me back to the mountains
Back to my home sweet home

  

Iwas a wild careless yongster
Longing to roam from the start
I left my home in the mountains
And broke my poor darling's heart

  

I caught a train at the crossing
And never told her goodbye
Then someone wrote me a letter
And told me my sweetheart had diedWell the week is gone good people
And friday's here at last
I'm going to take my old banjo
Play me a little bluegrass

I'm going were the mountains are higher
And the bluegrass is all around
Play me a song for my true true love
Listen to that mournful sound

    Carry me back to the bluegrass
    That's where I long to be
    I'm going to take my weary soul
    And head down to Torny creek

I long long to see the old folks
I long to see my home
I long to hear from my true true love
And have her all alone

I've got a girl she lives down yonder
In a little place called buffalo
As soon as I get back to her
That's where I want to goWell a big cardboard suitcase and a four-year old buick
Well aint's this a hell of a life
A hot Texas farm road and some quality foot wear
And me with three kids and a wife

Well, Rose, it ain't easy, cause I do get lonesome
And I know it's a sad thing to say
It's easy forgetting your wife and your family
When you're five hundred miles away

    Well, Rose, if you hear me try to forgive me
    Cause i feel it coming on me again
    Come saturday night I'll be in El Paso
    With Carolyn at hte broken wheel Inn

The driveway needs paving and monday's your birthday
And the kids all need new shoes agian
But hot damn my soul I'll spend twenty dollars
With Carolyn at the broken wheel InnLove, oh, love, oh careless love
Love, oh, love, oh careless love
Love, oh, love, oh careless love
You see what love has bone to me

I'd love my mama and papa too

Oh, how I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke, the sun was shining

    You made me out to be a fool now there's nothing left ot do
    You know that I can't stay here anymore

There's rumore that you've been running 'round
It's now become the gossip of the town
I can't hold up my head no more so I'm walking out that door
You know that I can't stay here anymore

 

I've been working hard everyday
Trying to make a better way
It makes no difference what I do there ain't no way to pleasing you
You know I can't stay here amymoreDear girl, I know I broke your heart
The thought of it I can't outlive

My heart, dear girl, is sinking fast
I have not long to live
Let us both forget the past
And say we will forgiveI have left the land of bondage with its earthly treasures
I've journeyed to a place where there is love on every hand
I've exchanged a land of heartaches for a land of pleasures
I'm camping, I'm camping in Canaan's happy land

    Every day I'm camping, camping, in the land of Canaan's land
    And with rapture I survey  its wondrous beauties grand, on glory
    Glory, hallelujah, I have found the land of promise, and
    I'm camping, I'm camping in Canaan's happy land

Out of Egypt I have travelled, thru the darkness dreary
Far over hills and valley's and across the desert sands
But I've landed safe at home where I shall not graw weary
I'm camping, I'm camping in Canaan's happy land

 

Yes, I've reached the land of promise with its scenes of glory
My journey ended in a place so lovely and so grand
I've been led by Jesus to this blessed land of story
I'm camping, I'm camping in Canaan's happy landCome and calm ( Calm this raging storm )
    The storm for me ( Calm the storm for me )
    Roll the clouds ( roll those heavy storm clouds )
    Out of the way ( All the clouds away )
    Make me see ( See the light that's shining )
    The blessed light ( See the blessed lighthouse )

When you calm ( When you calm )
The storm for me

All my life I've jeard the story
About a man from Galilee
How he calmed the reging river
And he walked the stormy sea
I can feel the winds a-blowing
Here upon my bended knees
So I'm callin' out to you, Lord
Come and calm the sea for me

 

Shining through the angry waves
( The angry waves )

Just as long ( Long as you're the captain )
As you're the captain ( captain of this vessel )
When my ship ( When my battered ship )
Is lost at sea ( Ship is lost at sea )
Then I know ( then I'll surely know )
I'll reeach the harbor ( Soon I'll reach the harbor )
When you calm ( When you calm )
The storm for meSince you went away, dear, I 've been so alone
You've let me the children, but you've broken up their home
But you couldn't stop your cheating and running around
Now everybody's talking about how you let them down

    My heart it is aching, you should be ashamed
    The children are crying and calling your name

Oh, Mommy, oh, Daddy, I think that it's a shame
I know you both love me, but I don't know who's to blame
But you couldn't stop your cheating and running around
Now everyvody's talking about how you let them downMy drifting memory goes back to the Spring of '43
When I was just a child in Mama's arms
My daddy ploughed the ground
And prayed that someday he might leave
This run down mortgaged Oklahoma farm

Then one day I heard my Daddy saying to my Mamma
That he had finally saved enough to go
Well California was his dream of Paradise for he had seen
Pictures in a magazine that told him so
(*)
California cotton fields
When labor camps were filled with worried men with broken dreams
California cotton fields
As close to wealth as Daddy ever came

Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From my Daddy's plough to the fruit that Mamma canned
Yes some folks came to say farewell
And to see what all we had to sell
Some just came shake my Daddy's hand
(**)
Yeah the Model A was loaded down and California bound
But the change it looked just four days away
But the only change that I remember seeing in my Daddy
Was when his dark hair turned to silver gray
(*)
(**)
(*)I'm going to California where they sleep out every night
I'm going to California where they sleep out every night
I'm leaving you, mama, for you know you don't treat me right

Listen to me, mama, while I sing you this song
Listen to me, mama, while I sing you this lonsome song
You got me worried now but I won't be worried long

Let me tell you something, mama, that you don't know
Let me tell you something, mama. that you don't know
I'm a do right papa got a home everywhere I go

Got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here
Got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here
I may ride the blinde I ain't got no railroad fareThere's a happy childhood home in my memory I can see
Standing out upon the hill neath the shadow of the free
If only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill

    Oh, I want to wonder back to the cabin on the hill
    Neath the shadow of the tree I would like to linger still
    Just to be with those I love, joy my heart would over fill
    Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill

But the saddest of it all can never more return
To that happy childhood home matters not how much I yearn
If only had my way it would give my heart a thrill
Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hillI'm slways a dreamer of romance
My love dream can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile thru tears dear at you

    I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
    Where all of our dreams would come true
    But another has taken my babin
    And left me so lonely and blue

Nestled around my babin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear to me

 

Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dream come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Of my cabin sweet heart dear and youThere's a cabin in the pine
In the hill of Caroline
And a blue-eyes girl is waiting there for me
I'll going back to stay
And from there I'll never stray
In a cabin in the hills of Caroline

    Oh, the cabin in the shadow of the pines
    And the blue-eyes girl down in Caroline
    Someday she'll be my wife
    And we'll live a happy life
    In a cabin in the hills of Caroline

I'm packing my grip
For that long trip
Back to the hills of Caroline
I wanna see the blue-eyes girl
She's the sweetest in the world
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline

  

And when it's late in night
And the moon is shining bright
And whepporwhill is callin' from the hill
Then I'll tell her of my love
When we've in the stars above
And I love her now and I know I always willTonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems I long for each day
All I have to do is sit alone and cry
In a little cabin home on the hill

    Oh, someone has taken you from me
    And left me here all alone
    Listen to the rain put on our window pane
    In a little cabin home on the hill

I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In a little cabin home on the hill

  

Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let your thoughts turn back
One more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hillThere goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy and I sure am blue
She was my baby till he came in
Goodbye to romance it might have been

    Bye bye love
    Bye bye happiness
    Hello loneliness
    I think I'm gonna cry
    Bye bye love
    Bye bye sweet caress
    Hello emptiness
    I think I'm gonna die
    Bye bye my love goodbye

I'm through with romance I'm though with love
I'm thtough with countin the starts above
Now here's a reason I'm so free
My loving baby walked out of meNow people who would rather live in splendor
Brag about their silver and their gold
People who would trade God's promise
For its treasure to hold
Now people who would rather live in mansions
People who would rather live abroad
But I'd rather have alittle log cabin
By the side of the road

    I'd rather live by the side of the road
    And try to point sould to the heavenly cross
    Than to be a king or millionaire
    And live in mansions and bright array
    I'd rather do my neighborly deed
    Or help some traveler or a friend in need
    I'd rather live by the side of the road
    And help some pilgrim along life's way

I'd rather have a cabin by the roadside
Where the pilgrim along life's way
Help to point souls to Jesus to that city on high
Every day I want to help scatter roses
Every night I want my light to shine abroad
With a welcome from my little bay wind
By the side of the road

�@So bury me under the lonesome pine tree
    There they'll forever sway over me
    There I can hear the sound of the lonesome dove
    In that beautiful land of peace and love

These lonesome pines are calling me home
Never again will I ever roam
They'll carry me home and put me to rest
In that mighty fine land that I love best

 

For years I've been away but the time has come today
I'll return to my homeland never to stray
For the rest of my days I'll rest in peace
And never again no one to pleaseI'll tell you a story 'bout a burgolar man who went to rob a house
He creeped in at the window just as quietly as a mouse
Thinkin' of the money that he would get, as under the bed he lay
He certainly saw a sight that night that made hes hair turn gray

About nice o'clock an old maid came in, "I'm so tired" she said
Thinkin' everything would be alright, she forgot to look under the bed
She pulled out her teeth, and her big glass eye, and her hair came from off'n her head
That burglar man had nineteen fits as he crawled from under the bed

She drew a pistol from out of the drawer, and to this burglar man said
"Young man if you don't marry me, I'll blow off the top of your head"
We'll he looked at her teeth and her big glass eye, and he had no place to scot
So he turned to the old maid standin' by, and said "Woman, for the Lord's sake shoot"

Now the burglar man is dead I know, but I don't know where he's gone
Up above, or down below, I'm now thru singin' this songBummin' an old freight train, oh Lord
    Bummin' an old freight train
    A thousand miles away from home
    Just a Bummin' an old freight train

I was a wild and reckless hobo, left my happy home
Started out on a western trip all by myself alone
My pocketbook was empty and my heart was filled with pain
A thousand miles away from homejust a Bummin' an old freight train

 

I was standing on a platform smokin' a cheap cigar
Waitin' for an old freight train to catch an empty car
My pocketbook was empty, my heart was filled with pain
A thousand miles away from home just a Bummin' an old freight train

 

I pulled my cap down over my eyes, I walked up to the train
Caught the stirrup of a sleepin' car and never did look back
A thousand miles away from home just a Bummin' an old freight trainBury me beneath the willow
Under the weeping willow tree
When she hears that I am sleeping
Maybe then she'll think of me

My heart is sad and I'm in sorrow
Weeping for the one I love
When shall see her, oh, no never
'Til we meet in heaven above

Tomorrow was to be our wedding
But Lord, oh Lord, where can she be
She's gone, she's gone to find another
She no longer cares for me

She told me that she did not love me
I couldn't believe it was true
Until an angel softly whispered
She no longer cares for you

Place on my grave a snow white lily
To prove my love for her was true
To show the world I died of grieving
For her love I could not winLooking for that bully
Bully of that town
Looking for that bully
That bully can't be found
I'm looking for that bully of the town

When I walk this levee round and round
Everyday I may be found
When I walk this levee round
I'm looking for that bully of the townSome gold morning when this life is o're
I'll fly away ( in the morning )
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away ( I'll fly away )

Years ago, when I was just a boy in the Oklahoma hills
They didn't have a church in which to pray
So the people got together and they built one of their own
Just a shelter made of poles with a roof of hay

Well, it wasn't just a Baptist or a Church of the Nazarene
But people of all faiths came there to pray
And it didn't make no difference the color or the time
And lots of folks would sing till break of day

    And they called ti a Brush Arbor meeting
    You could hear the people singing far away
    Just praising the Lord, and shouting victory
    I can still hear them singing today
    There is power, power, wonder working power
    In the precious blood of the Lamb

Now a day the churches are so pretty and so nice
And they all have different names upon their door
I wish we all would sshout and sing like we used to long ago
And come together like they did before

  

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for meHard luck poppa counting his toes
You can smell his feet wherever he goes
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Hard luck poppa don't do his stiff
Trouble with him he's been too rough
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Two old maids a-sitting in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Two old maids done lost their style
If you want to be lucky, you got to smile
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Early to bed and early to rise
And your girl goes out with other guys
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
If you don't bvelieve me, try it yourself
Well, I tried it and I got left
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues

Hard luck poppa standing in the rain
If the world was corn, he couldn't buy grain
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
His knees knock together but he's raing to go
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry BluesToday I feel so sad and weary
I want a love that cannot be
All I need to make me happy
Let those brown eyes smile at me

    Let those brown eyes smile at me, dear
    That's what I wish with all my soul
    Let those brown eyes smile at me, dear
    Turn my blue moon back to gold

Now we've been sweetheart so long darling
Now you're growin' tired of me
The last time that we were together
Those brown eyes didn't smile at meI traveled to Kentucky to court a fair young girl
Whose eyes were of the darkest brown and her hair had a charming curl
She had the sweetest lips to kiss that I had ever found
And she made ne feel as if I was the only man around

    Some people think of horses when you talk of the Bluegrss State
    Others think their bourbon is what makes it so great
    But the reason that the Bluegrass State stands in my memory
    Is that brown eyed Kentucky girl
    She means so much to me

I remember very clearly,it was on a warm spring night
We declared wa loved each other and to marry would be right
It was a short time later in the month of July
Our lives were joined together, we were one, she and I

  

Many years have come and gone since the day that we met
Our love has grown much storonger and it is growing yet
We have a happy home and children, we have three
We still enjoy each other, this Kentucky girl and meThe lordy's saved me, I want the world to know
I'm on my way to glory land
There I'll see Jesus and take Him by the hand
Brother I'm getting ready to go

    I'm getting ready to go I know
    I'm leaving this world here below
    Ain't nothing in this world can turn me back I know
    Brother I'm getting ready to go

Say there wake up while yet you have time
And in the glory land wave
Jesus will hear you and answer your call
Get ready to meet him today

  

Brother don't wait till it is too late
Jesus might call for you today
It's swful to know when you leave this old world below
If you are not ready to goThey were standing by the window
On the night he kissed her cheek
He had waited long in silence
Waited long for her to speak

When at last he whispered softly
As the cool breeze kissed her head
She had waited long to tell him
What they told her he had said

Oh they say you love another
That you never did love me
If these words be true my darling
I'll forever set you free

They are true he hardly answered
As the sun and stars above
When they told you my intentions
Then they told you of my love

He turned deathly pale and angry
Left her standing by the gate
Sent a message by her sister
But the message came too late

God in Heaven sent an Angel
To relieve her ache and pain
She went drifting off to Heaven
On an Angel's snow white wing

He was standing by her casket
As he looked upon her face
Then he realized he loved her
And no one could take her placeSee the engine puffing, boy she's making time
That old train's blowing off the rail, rail, rail
Heading for the mountain that she's got to climb
Bringing in the Georgia mail

Ninety miles an hour and she's gaining speed
Listen to the whistle moan and wail, wail, wail
Has she got the power I'll say yes indeed
Bringing in the Georgia mail

See the driver's puffing watch her spin the track
Ought to put that engineer in jail, jail, jail
Has he got her rolling watch her ball the jack
Bringing in the Georgia mail

Rocking and a reeling spouting off the steam
Stoke the fire and hope the brakes don't fail, fail, fail
Serving all the people listen to her scream
Bringing in the Georgia mailI was driving down a lonely road, on a dark and stormy night
A littele girl by the roadside showed up in my head lights
I stopped and she got inside and in a shaky tone
She said my name is Mary, please won't you take me home

She must have been so frightened, all alone there in the night
There was something about her, her face was deathly white
She set so pale and white in the back seat all alone
I never will forget the night, I took Mary home

I pulled into the driveway, where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car, opened up the door
I just could not believe my eyes, the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car, but Mary wasn't there

A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl was looking for
Then the lady gently smiled, brushed the tears away
She said it sure was nice of you to go out of your way

But thirteen years ago today, in a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life, how we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shown
You're the 13th one that's been here bringing Mary homeOut in the cold world and far away home
Some mother's boy is wandering all alone
With no one to guide him or keep his footsteps right
Some mother's boy is homeless tonight

    Bring back to me my wandering boy
    For there is no other who's so apt give me joy
    Tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
    Is at the old home place awaiting him there

Out in the hallway, there stand a vacant chair
And an old pair of shoes he used to wear
Empty is the cardle he used to love so well
Oh, how I miss him no tongue can tell

  

Well I remember those parting words he said
We'll meet up yonder where tears are never shed
In that land of sunshine away from toil and care
When life is over, I'll meet you up thereI'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
Don't look at me like you think I've got the blues
Because I'm walking round and round
And I'm seeing most of the town
I just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes

    Ah, ha, so I'm talking to myself
    Ah, ha, so I'm talking to myself
    Oh, no, she's not putting me on the shelf

I'm doggoned of I'm gonna cry the blues
My feet are sore but I got no time to lose
Because I'm wanting her here with me
And I'm needing her company
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoesLife to me is just a heartache
Since the day you said goodbye
Now I've nothing left to live for
All do is sit and cry

    I can't out live the memory of you
    Since the day we had to part
    All I have just a memory
    And a brand new broken heart

All I have is just a memory
A picture painted in my heart
It hurts to know you're gone forever
And forever more we'll be apartWhen it's decoration day up in heaven
    There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
    There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
    And mean's all the world to me

Tonight the old home place's lonely
Since mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her
Till we meet on that decoration day

  

I remember the night the angels called her
To live on that beautiful shore
It left us so lonely without her
It can never be home anymoreComing down from Tennessee, riding on the line
Studying about that gal of mine, couldn't keep from crying

    Honey baby I'm bound to ride
    Don't you want to go

Going to Atlanta, just to look around
Things don't sult me, I'll hunt another town

  

Riding on a streetcar, looking o'er the town
Eating salty crackers, ten cents a pownd

  

Working on a railroad, saving all I can
Looking for that woman that ain't got no man

  

If die a railroad man, bury me under the ties
So I can see old number nine as she goes rolling by

  

See that train a-coming, coming round the bend
Goodbye, my little darling, I'm on my way againBorn to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life, I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you're not there
You're grown tired, and now you say we're through
Born to lose, and now I'm losing you

Born to lose, my ever hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose, and now I'm losing youDo I find peace of mind ?
Yes I do, 'cos I was born to be with you

Wonderful love come be
So I knew that I was born to be with you

By your side satisfied
Through and through
'Cos I was born to be with youEvery word on my mind
Bonny is your good-bye
Black,black,black,black is the day
No sun is shining in my world
Bonny,since you went away

Sad,sad,sad,sad in my heart
All my loughter's turned to tears
Bonny,since you've been apart

Every pretty flower has
Turned to brown
They all look like me
With their head tied down
My heart only sing the sadness song
Bonny,since you've been gone

Cry,cry,cry,you know I cry
Every word on my mind
Bonny is your good-bye
Every word on my mind
Bonny is you good-byeSee that train comming round the bend
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth
But her soul has been called above

    Body and soul, body and soul
    Thats how she loved me with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold
Her eyes were blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose
And she promised she would always love me

  

Tommorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
Her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are fallin' rainThere's a Truck Driver down in old Kentucky
And he loves to listen to that Bluegrass music
Everywhere he goes you can hear that old banjo
And they call him the Bluegrass Truck Driver

    When the jukebox starts playing country music
    You can bet ti'll have that Bluegrass song
    When you hear the guitar and the banjo ringing
    You'll know the Bluegrass Truck Driver's back in town

Everytime he goes into a truck stop
He always starts the Bluegrass music spinning
He does that old Kentucky buck then climbs back on his truck
That's why they call him the Bluegrass Truck DriverRiding the bluegrass express
Riding the bluegrass express
This train will soon be gone
And I'm going home on the bluegrass express
She'll cress the river at Newport town
Louisville, Lexington, she's southbound
Richmond, Winchester, Bowling Green
Prettiest place I've ever seenThere was a girl I love so darly
She lived away  back in the hills
When the bluebird sings,I miss my darling
She loved me I know,she alway will

    There's a bluebird singing
    In the blue ridge mountain
    It's calling me back to my home
    Oh,I can here those bluebirds calling
    They'er calling me back to my home

Now tonight I'm far from the blue ridge mountain
Far from my home back in the hills
But I'm going back to the blue ridge mountain
There memories they haunt me still

  

When I reached home I was so lonely
The one I loved had gone away
That bad news came from her mother
She's sleeping beneath the crayShe's long she's tall
She's six feet from the ground
She's long she's tall
She's six feet from the ground
She's tailor made, you know she ain't no hand me down

She's got eyes like diamonds
Lord her teeth shine just the same
She's got eyes like diamonds
And her teeth shine just the same
She's got ruby lips and hair like a horse's mane

Every time I see you mama
You're always on the street
Every time I see you mama
You're always on the street
You hang out the corner like a police on his beat

Every time I need you mama
Lord I always find you gone
Every time I need you mama
Lord I always find you gone
Listen hear sweet mama, I'm gonna put your hair brace onIt's Sunday, blue Sunday, another lonely week will soon be gone
It's Sunday, blue Sunday, I'll spend another weekend all alone
I wonder where the blues will end my happiness will start
I wonder where it all begins this living with a broken heart

It's Sunday, blue Sunday, where can my darling be
Why is it every Sunday, we're apart
It's Sunday, blue Sunday, I've been right here alone the live long day
It's Sunday, blue Sunday, it seems that all my life it's been this way

Four walls to keep me company and a phone that just won't ring
The postman passes every day but he never leaves a thing
It's Sunday, blue Sunday, blue Monday's on its way
And I wonder what another week will bringWhen I was young in my prime
I left my home in Caroline
Now all I do is sit and pine
For all the folks I left behind
I've  got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right theere to say
My grip is packed to travel
And I'm scratching gravel
For that blue ridge far away

I'm gonna stay right by my ma
I'm gonna do right by my pa
Lay around the cabin door
No work on worry anymore
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
What to see my old day tray
What to hunt the possom
Where the corn top blossom
On that blue ridge far away

I see a window with the light
I see two heads of snowly white
It seems I can hear them both recite
Where is my wondering boy tonight
I'm got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right here to say
Every day I'm countaing
Still I crimb that mountain
Oh,that blue ridge far awayThere's a well beaten path in this old mountain side
Where I wonder when I was a lad
And I wondered alone to the place I call home
In those blue ridge hills far away

    Oh,I love those hills old virginia
    From those blue ridge hills I did roaw
    When I die won't you berry me in the mountain
    Far away in my blue ridge mountain home

Now my thoughts wander back to the raw shacle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
My mother and dad were laid back to rest
They are sleeping in peace togather there

  

I return to that home cabin home with the sigh
I've been longing for days gone by
When I die won't you burry me on that old mountain side
Make me resting place upon the hills so highBlue railroad train, goin' down the railroad track
Makes me feel so doggone blue to listen to that old smokestack
Traverse a-rollin' on, leavin' me here behind
Give me back them good old days and let me ramble down the line

Blue railroad train, leavin' me here alone
You treat me good, you treat me bad, you're makin' me think of home
I hear that lonesome train and love to hear the whistle blow
She's takin' the sun and leavin' the rain and makin' me wanna go
Blue railroad train, blue railroad train, blue railroad train

I got the blues, longin' for some company
It's many miles from where I am to the only one for me
I'm so lonesome here, waitin' for the mainfest
I hope that engineer is kind, enough to let me be his guest

Blue railroad train, a good old pal of me
Takes me everywhere I wanna go, get my transportation free
Blue railroad train, blue railroad train, blue railroad trainBlue night got you on my mind
Blue night can't keep on cryin'
You found someone that was new
You quit someone that you know was true
Blue night got you on my mind

Blue night blue as I can be
Cause I don't know what's become on me
Where we used to walk alone
With an achin'heart because my love is gone
Blue night blues as I can be

Blue night I'm all alone
I used to call you on the telephone
I used to call and it makes you glad
Now I call and it makes you mad
Blue night I'm all alone

Blue night all by myself
Since you put me on the shelf
There's just one thing you must know
You gonna reap just what you sow
Blue night all by myself
Blue night all by myselfRidin' with the wind
She's come and gone again

Some said she came from Georgia
Some said from Tennessee
But there never was another
Like my old blue mule
Lord know there'll never be
She could jump right over a mountain
She could outrun a diesel train
Her mother was that blue ox Babe
She was born in the eye of a hurricaine

Well I raced my blue mule
It was down in Tennessee
Against Molly and the Ten Brooks
All the people came to see
Ten Brooks was the favorite
People said I was a fool
Ridin' high wide the gates
And on my pretty blue mule

Hey blue mule, ridin' with the wind
She's come and gone again
Hey blue mule, ride on, ride on, blue mule

Around the track like a whirlpool
Old Molly had the lead
Then Ten Brooks nosed on out ahead
Boys, it was a wild stampede
Comin' in the final lap
Neck and neck, it was a duel
And my blue mule started flyin'
Which was agianst the rules

When we hit the finish line
The very last time around
I swear my blue mule she came out in front
Fifty feet from the ground
The crowd was cheerin' Ten Brooks
It was a sight to see
But overhead and out of sight
Was my old blue mule and me

Hey blue mule, ridin' with the wind
She's come and gone again
Oh look at her ride
Hey blur mule, ride on
Ride, ride, ride, blue mule

Well she never knew that race was run
She never came back down
She won that race in outer space
Not on solid ground
So when a storm is ragin'
And you hear a mournful wail
It's just me ridin' on my old blue mule
With the lightenin' stickin' her tail

Hey blue mule, she's ridin' with the wind
She's come and gone again
Oh hey blue mule, oh ride on
Ride on, oh ride on, blue mule
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride on, ride on, blue muleBlue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and prove untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on a moonlight night
The stars were shining bright
When they whisspered from on high
Your lover said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said good-bye
�@Well I'm on my way tonight        
And I hope the road is right      
For I've got to have you back     
Even if I have to steal           
Blue, is the way that I feel      
                                  
I've been on this road so long    
I guess your love for me is gone  
But I'm coming back somehow       
For my love for you is real       
Blue is the way that I feelIn the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted
I know we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has truned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rainThe days have passed by slowly
Since you've gone and left me blue
If ever you decide to roam dear
Remember I'm waiting just for you

    Won't you be by blue eyed darling
    Won't you come back home to me
    Don't tell me that you found another
    Darling please don't set me free

At night as I lay down to sleep dear
The tears flow down my cheeks
Because you left me such a memory
And now I'm all alone you see

  

Someday you'll come and I'll be gone dear
Gone out to start life anew
But if you never do return dear
Remember I'll be linely and blueIn my lonely heart there lingers
A dream that haunts me again
Of a girl with eyes like the flowers
Thta grew down in Blue Bonnet Lane

    On the sweet and happy hours
    In my heart they will always remain
    Like the sweet fragrance of the flowers
    That grew down in Blue Bonnet Lane

I can see a pale moon rising
Above a blue misty plane
As I walk with my blue eyed darling
In my memory once againIt's been a blue,blue day I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues
My love her been untrue she's found somebody new
It's been a blue,blue day for me

I feel like crying,dyin'what can I do
I feel like praiyin'sayin'I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue,blue day I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues

How can I make bilieve that I don't sit and grieve
It's been a blue,blue day for me
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway
It's been a blue,blue day for me

I feel like cryin'dyin'what can I do
I feel like prayin'sayin'I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue,blue day I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues
I feel like running away from the bluesThe lonesome sigh of train going by
Make me wanna stop and cry
I recall the day he took you are way
I'm blue,I'm lonesome,too

    When I'm here the whistle blow
    I wanna pack my trank and go
    The lonesome sigh of train going by
    Make me wanna stop and cry

In the still of night in the pale moonlight
The wind,it moans and sight
There awful blues I just can't lose
I'm blue,I'm lonesome,tooIn a quiet little village not so very far away
There lived a rich and aged man whose hair was turning gray
He had three sons his only ones, both Jack and Tom were sly
While Ted was honest and could  be, he would not tell a lie

They tried thier best to ruin Ted in the old man's eyes
Their poison soon began to work till Ted was much despised
One night the old man said, begone you're heartless to the core
There are the words the lad then said as he stood by the door

    Don't be angry with me Dad, don't turn me from your door
    I know that I've been wayward but I won't be any more
    Give me just another chance put me to the test
    You'll find a black sheep loves his dad far better than the rest

Year by year sped quickly by, the father had grown old
Called Jack and Tom to him and said I give you all my gold
I only need this little room a place at your fireside
One night on Jack's returning home he brought with him a bride

The wife began to hate the Dad, more and more each day
One night he heard the three declare, the old fool is in our way
They all agreed to send him to the poorhouse that was near
Then like a flash the black sheep's words came ringing in his ears

 

A wagon drove up to the door, it was the poorhouse van
The brothers pointed to their Dad and said there is your man
Just then a manly form appeared and pushing through the crowd
Don't take my Dad, the stranger said this will not be allowed

You took away his property and all that he could save
You even sold the little spot that marked your mother's grave
I'm still his son but not your kin from now till judgement day
The Father clasped the black sheep's hand, the crowd then heard him say

    Oh don't be angry with me son I turned you from my door
    I know that I was foolish I've repented o're and o're
    I wish I'd given you my gold for you have stood the test
    I found the black sheep loves his Dad far better than the restBlack Jack Davey come a running through the woods
Singing so loud and gailey
Made the hills a round him ring
Then charmed the heart of a lady, charmed the heart of a lady

How old are you my pretty little miss
How old are you my honey
Answered him with a philly and a smile
I'll be sixteen next Sunday, be sixteen next Sunday

Come go with me my pretty little miss
Come go with me my honey
I'll take you across the deep blue sea
Where you never shall want for money, never shall want for money

She pulled off her high heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
She put on her low heeled shoes
And they both went off together, both went off together

Last  night I lay on a warm feather bed
Side my husband and baby
Today I lay on the cold, cold ground
Side of Black Jack Davey, side of Black Jack DaveyI love my wife, I love my baby
I like my biscuits sopped in gravy

    Hey, black-eyed Susie
    Hey, pretty little black-eyed Susie, Hey

All want in this creation
Pretty little wife and a big plantation
Up red oak and down salt water
Some old man gonna lose his daughter

 

Susie and the boys went huckleberry pickin'
The boys got drunk and Susie got a lickin'
Some got drunk and some got boozy
But I made love to black-eyed Susie

 

All I need to make me happy
Is two little boys to call me pappy
One named Paul, the other one Davy
One likes ham and the other one gravyAll I want in this creation
Pretty little white and a big plantation

    Hey, little black eyed Susan
    Hey, little black eyed Susan
    Hey, little black eyed Susan, Hey!

All need to keep me happy
Two little boys to call me pappy

  

Up Red Oak and down salt water
Some old man gonna lose his daughter

  

Black eyed Susan went huckleberry pickin'
The boys got drunk and Susan took a lickin'

  

Some got drunk and some got boozy
I went home with black eyed Susan

  

Black eyed Susan about half grown
Jumps on the boys like a dog on a bone

  

I asked her to be my wife
She come at me with a barlow knife

  

Love my wife, love my baby
Love my biscults sopped in gravyI'll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid
I'll sing of the reckless deeds that the did
Way out in New Mexico a long time ago
When a man's only friend was his own forty-four

When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out in the west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his firstman

Fair Mexico maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Now here is young manhood htat reached its sad end
He'd notch on his pistol for twenty-one men

Now 'twas on the same nihgt that poor Billy died
He said to his freinds:"I'm not satisfied
It's twenty-one men that I've put bullets through
And sherriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two"

Now this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shining, and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The poor outlaw's life had reached its sad end

Now this is the true song of Billy the Kid
these were the reckless deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico, a long time ago
When a man's only friend was his own forty-four

There's many a fine boy with a face fine and fair
Who starts out in life with a chance to be square
But just like poor Billy, he wanders astray
Then he loses his life in the very same wayWent up on the mountain
Just to give my horn a blow
Thought I heard my true love say
Yonder comes my beau

    Bile them Cabbage down
    Turn them hoecakes round
    The only song that I can sing
    Is bile them cabbage down

Took my gal to the blacksmith shop
To have her mouth made small
She turned around a time or two
And swallowd shop and all

  

Possum in a Simmon tree
Raccoon on the ground
Raccoon says you son-of-a-gun
Shake some Simmon's down

  

Someone stole my old 'coon dog
Wish they'd bring him back
He chased the big hogs through the fence
And the little ones through the crack

  

Met a possum in the road
Blind as he could be
Jumped the fence and whipped my dog
And bristled up at me

  

Once I had an old gray mule
His name was Simon Slick
He'd roll his eyes and back his ears
And how that mule would kick

  

How that mule would kick
He kicked with his dying breath
He shoved his hind feet down his throat
And kicked himself to deathWoke up this morning, heard the whistle blow
The jailor said come boy, it's time to go
Big midnight special, shine your light on my
Big midnight special shine your everloving light on me

I've never had the blues so, in my life before
Till my baby left me at the station door
They put him in a pullman, guards around his door
Said, you off to Atlanta to serve ten years more

He looked all around him in the pullman car
Saw the men wearing clothe hats, smoking big cigars
Took him off in Atlanta, at the end of the line
Said, you start serving time, boy, for your awful crime

That whistle makes me lonesome on that midnight train
But he knows I'm a-waiting till it brings him home againBig ball in Boston, big ball in Boston
    Big ball in Boston, gonna dance around

Little glass of sherry, little glass of wine
Let's have a party, let's have a time

  

My love's in jail boys, my love's in jail
My love's in jail boys, who'll go her bail

  

Roll on the ground, boys, roll on the ground
Eating soda crackers, ten cents a pound

  

Look at all pretty girl walking down the street
Kicking up their heels, they're happy on their feetWell the cows went dry, the hens don't lay, there's no place I can borrow
Give the landlord all the news and the rent comes due tomorrow
Lots of money in the bank they say that's where they keep it
Not only wouldn't they loan me some they wouldn't let me see it

    So pick away on the old banjo
    Keep that guitar strumming
    Put more water in the soup
    There's better times a-coming

Well Mary Lou could pull a plow if only I would let her
Twice as strong as any ox and she don't smell much better
I didn't kiss that Mary Lou but once and then I had to leave her
Make's my collar get so tight, I start to burn with fever

  

Well a man came by the other day a-huntin manual labor
I told him I hadn't seen the guy why don't he ask the neighbor
So come on boys get your gals and kick your heels up higher
Don't let no one steal your gal just hold her a little tighter

  

My rooster used to chase a hen he just kept getting thinner
He nearly ran himselfs to death so I bought him in for dinner
Cotton crops are mighty poor the weeds are really a-growin
I need a woman pretty bad to help me with the hoeinSo your of love has finally reached its ending
The winner smiles as you are left behind
You will taste the better cup of love's illusion
Just chalk one up and better luck next time

    Better luck next time for now you're reaping
    All the bitterness that once was mine
    Live and love then learn the fate that's pending
    A broken heart but better luck next time

There's no way that we can look into the future
Sut a lesson we may learn from scenes behind
In the future there's a promise of tomorrow
If given you then better luck next timeBetter late than never
    Better let you see
    Better late than never
    Darlin' wait for me

The other night I seen my girl
We had a date
Supposed to been there at seven
Showed up at eight

 

Yonder comes a man into my house
For his revenue
He said I'll pay it up my friend
Give me a day or two

 

Now if you love your women
Like I do mine
Give 'em a little lovin'
Just any timeRedheaded peckerwood, setting on a limb
Mama said chicken, but Nellie shot him
Rung his neck and picked him clean
The funniest chicken I've ever seen

    Hey! Barefoot Nellie, Ho! Barefoot Nellie
    Hey! Barefoot Nellie, you're the one for me

Nellie put on her Sunday dress
Thought that it would look the best
Made out of an old feed sack
Cow feed wrote on the back

  

Nellie went to town one day
Riding on a load of hay
Sold a man a trip to Mars
Now she sits behind the bars

  

Three leg hog walking cross the lot
Making three tracks and just one dot
Nellie said who do you think I am
That hog's missing about one ham

  

Nellie's got a pair of shoes
She can wear them if she'll choose
So why the heck's she got the blues?
Who wants to wear size 22Be honest with me dear whatever you do
Remember you're mine dear so always be true
Wherever you wander on land or on sea
If you really love me, be honest with me

My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear I'll dream about you
Oh, you are my darlin' you're all that I see
If you really love me, be honest with me

Some day I'll return dear and make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I'm all alone
I'll never forget dear your sweet memory
If you really love me, be honest with meWell, pack up your car, go on and leave, and tell your folks that we are through
Honey that ain't going to make me grieve cause I know just what you'll do
You'll pout and cry and sweat that I am the meanset man in town
But I'll bet money that you'll be back before the sun goes down

    Before the sun goes down you'll be all ready for some lovin'
    You'll run to your daddy for some kissin' and huggin'
    And I'll be waitin' around
    For I know you'll be home before the sun goes down

Honey there ain't nothing else in the book that you ain't said
All kinds of names and low down things, I've heard them all from A to Z
And when you've had your say you'll up and run away and swear you're leavin' town
But you'll cool off, come a draggin' it back before the sun goes downI thought I had seen pretty girl in my time
That was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
That was before I met you

    I thought I was swinging the would by the tail
    I thought I could never be blue
    I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
    But that was before I met you

I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold to me
That was before I met you

  

They tell me I must reap just what I have sown
Darling I hope that's not true once I made plans
About living alone
That was before I met youmake me a bed right down on your floor

And I seldom sleep in a bed
When my feet get tired of walking
I simply stand on my

    Kissed and caressed by the dew
    Beautiful morning glory
    Good morning glory to you

I stopped at a house for a hand-out
I'd rather do htat than to beg
When up jumped a big yellow hound-dog
And bit a hunk out of my

 

A little boy gave me his football
I said "Watch me kick it a block"
Now my foot's wrapped up in a bandage
'Cause inside the ball was a

I knoked off her wig at a dance
And when I stooped over to get it
She kicked me right in the

 

One day I went out to the ball game
And peeped thru a knot-hole up high
A guard took a big water pistol
And squirted me right in theThere's a beautiful moon shining down on Kentucky
Where the fields of bluegrass are growin'
Neath the beautiful moon shining down on Kentucky
Tomorrow that's where I'll be going

    For the girl that I love she waits for me know
    To return from ole sunny Tennessee
    Neath the beautiful moon shining down on Kentucky
    Tomorrow that's where I will be

Well, I left my old home way down in Kentucky
And headed for old sunny Tennessee
But I'm on my way back to the hills of Kentucky
With my darling once more there I'll beAlong the green lanes in the springtime
I gathered the violets blue
Echoing yet with the bee-song
And wet with the morning dew

    Gathered them for sweet Mabel
    Beautiful Mabel Claire
    Clasped in her dainty fingers
    And braid in her shining hair

And then when the summer was fairer
For the love of those brown, brown eyes
I gathered the royal roses
Fairer than sunset skies

And then comes dreary November
Making me moan and weep
For closing her brown eyes softly
Dear Mable has gone to sleep

    Closing her brown eyes softly
    Beautiflu Mabel Claire
    No more will I gather the roses
    To braid in her shining hairEach day I do a golden deed
By helping those who are in need
My life on earth in but a span
And so I'll do the best I can

    Life's evening sun is sinking low
    A few more days and I must go
    To meet the deeds that I have done
    Where there will be no setting sun

To be a child of god each day
My light must shine along the way
I'll sing his praise while ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul

  

While going down life's weary road
I'll try to lift some traveler's load
I'll try to turn the night to day
Make flowers bloom along the way

  

The only life that will endure
Is one that't kind and good and pure
And so for god I'll take my stand
Aach day I'll lend a helping handI know a girl in Carolina, she's the sweetest girl in town
Big blue eyes that sparlke like dew drops on the ground
To meet her is to love her, she makes your heart grow fond
Heaven's not far above her, she's a beautiful blue eyed blonde

I met her in November, one cold and dreary day
She brought the sunshine with her, that's in my heart today
No need to say I love her, for she's like the day just dawned
She brightens the world with her laughter, she's a beautiful blue eyed blonde

If I had all the gold in the treasury, and all of the riches on earth
I would not trade my sweetheart, for I know just what she's worth
Her voice is like sweetmusic, she makes my heart grow fond
You'd love her if you'd see her, she's a beautiful blue eyed blonde

Every night I dream I'm near her, then I wake to sind she's away
But I hope someday we'll marry, and be together always
If all my dreams were realones, and after the day had dawned
I'd awake and find her near me, my beautiful blue eyed blondeBeautiful beautiful brown eyes
    Beautiful beautiful brown eyes
    Beautiful beautiful brown eyes
    I'll never love blue eyes again

Willie I love you my darling
Love you with all my heart
Tomorrow we might have been married
But rambling has kept us apart

  

Down through the barroom he staggered
And fell down at the door
The last words that I heard him utter
I'll never see brown eyes no more

  

Seven long years I've been married
Wish I was single again
A woman mever knows her troubles
Until she has married a manIn scarlet Town where I was born
There was a fair maid dwelling
Made many a youth cry well a day
Her name was Barbara Allen

It was in the memrry month of May
When green buds they were swelling
Sweet William came from the west country
And he courted Barbara Allen

He sent his servant unto her
To the place where she was dwelling
Said my master's sick, bids me call for you
If your name be Barbara Allen

Well, slowly, slowly got she up
And slowly went she nigh him
But all she said as she passed his bed
Young man I think you're dying

Then lightly tripped she down the stairs
She heard those church bells tolling
And each bell seemed to say as it tolled
Hard hearted Barbara Allen

O, mother, mother go make my bed
And make it long and narrow
Sweet William died for me today
I'll die for him tomorrow

They buried Barbara in theold church yard
They buried Sweet William beside her
Out of his grave grew a red, red rose
And out of hers a briar

They grew and grew up the old church wall
Till they could grow no higher
And at the top twined a lover's knot
The red rose and the briarI asked my love to take a walk
To take a walk, just a little walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

    And only say that you'll be mine
    In no other's arms entwine
    Down beside where the waters flow
    Down by the banks of the Ohio

I held a knife against her brest
As into my arms she pressed
She cried, "Oh, Willie, don't murder me,
I'm not prepared for eternity"

  

I started home 'tween twelve and one
I cried, "My God! what have I done ?
Killed the only woman I loved
Because she would not be my bride"Come and listen to my story 'bout a man named Jed
Poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed
Then one day he was shootin' at some food
And up through the ground came a bubbling crude
(Oil, that is, Texas tea, black gold)

First thing you know, old Jed's a millionaire
Friends said, Jed, move away from here
Said that California was the place he ought to be
So he loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(Hills, that is, swimming pools and movie stars)

Well, now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You're all invited back again to this locality
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
(Beverly Hillbillies, that's what they call 'em now
Nice folks, Y'all come back now, hear?)Read an ad in Chicago's Sunday paper
Help wanted, semi driver needed bad
I walked in I said I'd like to see the foreman
I told him all the experience that I had

Said son you're just the man I needed
Handed me the keys and shook my hand
He pointed to the truck and said I'll see you
Take that load of steel to Birmingham

Well I finally got inside and got it started
Put it into gear and started backing up
Tried every way to get it going forward
Oh, but I ain't never drove a big old truck

Well it wasn't easy backing through the traffic
And I'll bet I'm the first truck driving man
That ever left Chicago in a semi
And backed it all the way to Birgingham

Well the police pulled me over down in Nashville
What do you think you are doing, I just smiled
I said I just got tired of going forward
And I thought I'd drive it backwards for a while

I backed it in a truck stop and said fill it
And check the oil it probably needs a can
Oh, he said tell me which way are you backing
I said I'm backing south to Birmingham

Well, there must be a button on here somewhere
That I can push to turn this thing around
Well I can make it fine out in the country
But I sure have trouble getting through the town

But if I keep it up I'll finally make it
And I'll bet I'm the first truck driving man
That ever left Chicago in a semi
And back it all the way to BirginghamI'm out on the sea filled with sorrows
Tossed like a ship who ran ashore
I'm seeking the help of my saviour
By the way of the cross I must go

    Back to the cross and to Jesus
    Back to the cross I am called
    I've drifted too far and I've wandered
    From the saviour that once was my home

The sins of this world have overcome me
Have pushed and left me to roam
So I'm going to back to my saviour
Back to the cross and home

  

The joy of these life are too fleeting
And wrapped in troubles around
I've lost the church of the stranger
I've drifted too far from homeBaby I'm in love with you
Drowned in your eyes so blue
Tell me that you love me too
I just want to be with you

Come and let me hold your hand
Till I make you understand
I just want to be your man
Baby I'm in love with you

I'm forever building dreams
Around your pretty head it seems
Do you want to spoil my dreams
By saying that you'll never be mine

I'll take an ocean trip
Just to kiss your dear sweet lips
I would walk a million miles
To hear you say you love me too

I'm forever building dreams
Around your pretty head it seems
Do you want to spoil my dreams
By saying that you'll never be line

I'll take an ocean trip
Just to kiss your dear sweet lips
I would walk a million miles
To hear you say you love me too
I'll be your for ever more
Baby I'm in love with youLittle girl ( little girl ) baby girl
   She's my darling little precious baby girl
   Like an angel to me and I know that he
   Sent from Heaven my little baby girl

She's as sweet as the flowers of springtime
Her blue eyes they sparkle so bright
Just a touch of her little baby hand
Seems to guide my weary footsteps day and night

  

How those two little arms try to hold me
Her little heart's a blessing to our home
And at night when I'm far far away
As dream of her I'm never all aloneI wonder if I'll ever forget you
And if our love that's true ever dies
I can't forget the kisses you gave me
Or memories of your two baby blue eyes

    I'll always keep a memories of you
    Visions of eyes as blue as the sky
    And that's why each night there's tears on my pillow
    I'm dreaming of your two baby blue eyes

Now when day is done and shadows are fallin
My love will sleep 'til morning sunrise
I lay awake just tossing and turning
I'm longing for dreams of baby blue eyes

  

Now day after day try to keep snillin'
And a broken heart I try to disguise
Now right after night my lonely heart's callin'
It's callin' for you my baby blue eyesTonight I'm dreaming of Avery County
    Where the cool mountain breezes blow
    O'er the laurels and rhododendrons
    And my sweet Avery County Rose

I can hear the old folks singing
While the fiddles softly play
I can hear that banjo ringing
Thru the valley at close of day

 

The fragrance of the flowers
Fill the air with sweet perfume
As my sweetheart walked beside me
Neath that Avery County moonTwo years we've been fighting though it seems like a hundred
Away to the south there's a home I onece knew
Where mu loved ones are waiting for a word from the Captain
That the battle has ended for the gray and the blue

I left dear old Georgia on the first day of April
The grass in the valley was just turning green
I married my Sally just a week before leaving
We now have a baby that I've never seen

She wrote me a letter that told of our baby
He's just like his daddy is the words that it said
But thats been so long now that it seems like foever
And Lord I'm so homesick I wish I were dead

Atlanta is burning the horizon is flaming
The thunder of cannons in the distance I hear
I think of my Sally and the son that she gave me
If I could just see her and the baby so dear

A bullet has found me and the darkness is falling
The pain is unreal and my body so weak
The Captain is calling is but I cannot answer
My thoughts wonder soughts wonder southland as go to sleepI talked with a stranger so sad and forlorn
His garments were sack cloth all tattered and torn
He told me a story of sorrow and woe
His heart went to heaven at the first fall of snow

He spoke of his angel a dear baby girl
He loved every footstep he loved every curl
But she went to heaven just one year ago
The angels came for her at the first fall of snow

And there as I listened my eyes filled with tears
I know she was part of his happier years
His frail bady trembled he spoke soft and low
I'll be with my darling at the first fall of snow

I just couldn't tell him how felt inside
I patted his shoulder my feeling to hide
He sniled as we parted cause he didn't know
That we lost our darling at the first fall of snowAt the end of a long lonely day without you
When the world seems to fall in my face
I'm all right through the day, but the day fades away
And a long lonely night takes its place

    Another day to wish that you were here
    I dread each lonely night that's filled with tears
    Though I've tried and I've tried, these are tears that I can't hide
    At the end of a long lonely day

At the end of the day I go up to my room
And I watch while the sun fades away
And the lonliness there brings me grief and despair
At the end of a long lonely day

 

Another day to sit alone and cry
It makes no difference if I live or die
With the world locked outside, I just lay there and cry
At the end of a long lonely dayThe love light that shines in your eyes
Has gone out to my suprise
We said good-bye,my suprise
I can't revive,your love is dead

    Ashes of love,cold as ice
    You made the bed,I'll pay the price
    Our love is gone,there's no doubt
    Ashes of love,the flames burned out

I trusted dead,our love would stand
You ever wish was my command
My heart tells me I must forget
I love you then,I love you yetNo one can ever hold the wind
So don't waste your time a-holding on to me
Just let me love and I'll be gone again
For there's one thing little girl that you must see

    As long as the wind blows, as long as the river flows
    As long as train whistle screams
    As long as a wind goose flies, as the flood tides rise
    There's just no way of holding me

Me this chain gang can never hold
A man with such a wandering restless soul
Just turn your back and that's the last time that you will see
This old wandering boy from Tennessee

 

Mama it's so good to be back home
It's not right for you and Papa to be here alone
But listen to that late evening train
Well I could of swore I heard it call my nameAs long as I live ( As long as I live )
    If it be one hour ( If it be one hour )
    Or if it be ( or if it be ) one hundred years
    I'll keep remembering ( I'll keep remembering )
    For ever and ever ( For ever and ever )
    I love you dear ( I love you dear )
    As long as I live

It love you said that night you left me
That we'd forget that we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten, I wonder if you have
Or is your heart to full of regret

 

I never thought that night you left me
That life alone could be so sad
It may sound funny but I'll never forget you
You're the only joy that I ever hadOh, once upon a time in Arkansas
An old man sat in his little cabin door
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
A jolly old tune that he played by ear
It was raining hard, but the fiddler didn't care
He sawed aways at the popular air
Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
That didn't seem to bother the old man at all

A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn't seem to fret
So the stranger said Now, the way it seems to me
You'd better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn't mend it now, it's a rainy day

The rtaveler replied that's all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight
But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
Get along said he for you give me a pain
My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rainHave you been to Jesus fot the cleansing power
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you fully trusting in his grace this hour
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb

    Are you washed ( are you washed )
    In the blood ( in the blood )
    In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb
    Are you garments spotless ?
    Are they white as snow ?
    Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb

Are you walking daily by the Saviour's side
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb

  

When the Bridegroom cometh will you robes be white
Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb
Will you soul be ready for the mansion bright
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb

  

Lay saide the garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean
Oh, be washed in the blood of the LambWhile I'm writing you tonight my darlin'
There's such a burning deep within my breast
I know you promised that you would be faithful
Well tell me honey have you stood the test

    Are you waiting just for me my darling
    While I'm far across the deep blue sea
    Or have you found someone else my darling
    Please tell me are you waiting just for me

Of couse I know I should not ever doubt you
For you have always been so true and kind
But somehow I just can't sleep at night dear
For thinking of a new love you might find

  

Or maybe it is just the way I'm feeling
That makes me write this letter to you dear
But somehow I just can't sleep at night dea
For losing you love is my greatest fearWhen we're all alone dear and I'm in your arms
Are you teasing me
When you're telling me how I thrill to your charms
Are you teasing me

    Are you untrue when I'm not with you
    When we're apart are you free
    Tell me darling while our love is still young
    Are you teasing me

You say that my kiss sends your heart in a whirl
Are you teasing me
And that you'll be mine till the end of the world
Are you teasing me

  

You tell me my love makes your life complete
Are you teasing me
And never from my arms would you long to be
Are you teasing meThe day that I kissed you and told you goodbye
Your lips told me that you would wait
But your lips deceive me and told me a lie
While your heart was sealing my fate

    Are you all alone
    With a memory
    Now that I'm gone
    Darling, are you missing me

Out of a gray sky a letter then came
And just like a bolt from the blue
My castles came tumblin' as I read it oer
I still can't believe that it's true

  

It said that in spite of the vows you had made
The glitter of gold turned your head
And while I was trying employment to find
You married another insrteadMy days and nights are lonely darling since you left and went away
I still recall those unkind words were said that day
It hurts me so to know you're leading a life that I'm to blame
Believe me darling I'll do better just the same

    Then come on back and lets begin our love anew
    Deep down inside there's still a lonesome for you
    Those unkind words were spoken dear we will just let them be
    Please tell me darling are you coming back to me

Each night I go to bed the dreams I dream my dear are all of you
How I just love to gaze into your eyes of blue
There'll never be another sweetheart that can take the place of you
Tell me you still care for me, dear, please doAre you a stranger to God
Carried away with your pride ?
Tell me sinner did you ever step to think ?
Are you afraid to die ?

    Are you afraid ?
    Are you unseved ?
    Are you afraid to die ?

Call on him while he is near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek him while he may be found ?
Are you afraid to die ?

  

Are you too wicked to cry ?
Would you to God's bossom fly ?
Soon he's comming like a thier in the night
Are you afraid to dieAnother day, another dollar
    Daylight comes I'm on my way
    Another day, another dollar
    I'm workin' my whole life away

My boss told me I'd get paid weakly
That exactly how I'm paid
Another day, another dollar
I'm workin' my whole life away

  

My family's my thanbksgiving
And I love em more each day
They're the reason I keep livin'
And workin' my poor life awayAnna dear, they say tomorrow you'll be leavin'
If only you had been the one to tell me so
I could try, at last, to understand the reason
But the one who cares the most is always the last to know

Anna dear, the road from town is cold and lonely
If you leavebehind the one whose faith you know
Many years will pass before you find tomorrow
Why can't you believe the one who never let it show

As I stand and watch you leave I wonder
Anna didn't find enough to show you that I care
Could you feel the same again I ask forgiveness
But the one who cares the most is always the last to know
But the one who cares the most is always the last to knowMy latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My longest trials now are passed
My triumph has begun

    On come angel band
    Come and around me stand
    Bear me away on your snowy wings
    To my immortal home
    Bear me away on your snowy wings
    To my immortal home

Oh,bear my loving heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sins
And gives me victory

  

I've almost reached my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
The holy ones,behold they come
I hear the noise of wingsShe looks at him from across
All the other bedrooms she's been lost in
Suddenly scared because
She can't see his face at all
Until he speaks out loud
And he say I love you

She takes his arm and holds it tight
And wishes he'd turn out the hall light
And says for the second time that night
You sure say funny things
But she's not laughing then
And he says I love you

And he never say Because
And who does he think that he is ?
And she says You don't know all
and he says I know , I know

Later on she shuts the bathroom deer
Wondering what it is he likes her for
The water sure is nice and warm
She tries to think and can't
Of what he might have meant
When he said I love you

And he never says Because
And who does he think that he is ?
and she says You don't know all
And he says I know, I knowSetting alone in an old rocking chair
I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who still care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Her hands were all calloused wrinkled and old
A life of hardwork was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw here there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

Bless her old heart do you think she'd complain
Life has been bitter tho' she'd live it again
And carry the cress that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembverance on somebody's part
A letter would bringten her empty life there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

I know some youngster's in an old orphan's home
Who'd think they owned Heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chairWhile strolling alone in the country
Reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin
So beautiful there to behold

A stranger was standing in silence
His eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him
For these were the words that it bore

    In the sign read an old log cabin for sale
    An old oaken bucket and well
    Easy terms, just keep a log on the fire each day
    And a light burning bright in the dell

Many years an old couple so partiently looked
For a boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rockin' chairs will be rockin' no more
There's an old lgo cabin for sale

How long has it been since you've written
A letter to mother and dad
How long has it been since you've seen them
Oh why don't you make their heart glad

Too soon will the old home be bacant
A candle light gleaming no more
Don't wait 'til too late to remember
There may be a sign on the door

 

Many years an old couple so partiently looked
For a boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rockin' chairs will be rockin' no more
There's an old log cabin for saleFar away in some deep mountain
Where the merry sunbeams play
There I wanmdered thru the clover
Singing to a village maid

    She was dearer than the dearest
    Ever loving kind and true
    And she wore beneaht her bonnet
    Amber tressee tied in blue

Fact decreed that we parted
When the leaves of autumn fell
Then two hearts were seperated
That had loved each other well

  

She was all I had to cherish
Every loving king and true
Now I see in every vision
Amber tresses tied in blueAmazing grace,how sweet the sound
That saved a wreach like me
I once was last but now am found
Was blind but now I see

I was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believe

Though many dangers toils and sound
I have already come
Tis grace have brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me homeAlways be kind to your mother
It's the greatest gift you can give
Obey and do what she tells you
And pray that long here, she may live

    We all take mothers for granted
    And do things that cause her much pain
    I know for I lost my sweet mother
    Got took her from this world of sin

Please go to your mom while she's living
And tell her you love her today
To her, you're always her baby
She loves you till death makes its claimWhen we were young and we thought we loved each other
But you didn't love me I guess
For you've gone and you've found another
Everything to you is regret

    This morning along about daybreak
    You taunted me the whole night through
    I know it's not too late for your sake, dear
    But for me I will always be blue

Oh, I'm worried my darling, I'm worried
Just to know your love's grown cold
For without you life will be so dreary
We'll need each other when we grow old

  

Oh, sweetheart be good to our baby
And I want you to teach him to pray
Tell him to say a little prayer for dear daddy
Will you be the one to sayI wish to the load I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your liyn' tongue

    All the good time are past and gone
    All the good time are o'er
    All the good time are past and gone
    Little darling don't weep no more

Don't you see that turtle dove
That flies from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine

   

Don't you see that passenger train
Going around the bend?
It's talking away my own true love
To never return again

   

Come back,come back my own true love
And stay a while with me
For if ever I've had a friend in this world
You've been a friend to meIt was midnight on the ocean not a street car was in sight
I stepped into a drug store to get myself a light
The man behind the counter we a lady old and gray
Who used to peddle do-nuts on the road to Mandalay

Good evening sir she said, here eyes were bright with tears
She put her head benbeath her fat and stood that way for years
Her children six were orphans except the tiny tot
Who lived in a house across the street up in a vacant lot

    Ain't we crazy, ain't we crazy
    This is the way we pass the time away
    Ain't we crazy, ain't we crazy
    We're going to sing this song all night do-dayI ain't gonna work tomorrow
    Ain't gonna work today
    Ain't gonna work tomorrow,lord
    For that is my wedding day

I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
But I'd leave them both to go with you

 

I've been all around this country
I've been all around this world
I've been all around this country,lord
For the sake of one little girl

 

I'm leaving you this lonesome song
I'm leaving you this lonesome song
I'm leaving you this lonesome song
Cause I'm gonna be gone before longI remember when I made you cry
Ages and ages ago
I'll never blame you for our last goodbye
Ages and ages

Someone came along and took my place
How wrong I was to let you go
And though it happened only yesterday
It seems like ages nad ages ago

Someone told me when you walked away
That time would make me miss you so
And though it hapened only yesterday
It seems like ages and ages agoI've been up and down and around and around and back again
Been so many place I can't remember where or when
And my only boss was a clook on the wall and my only friend
Never really was a friend at all

    I've traded love for pennies sold my soul for less
    Lost my deals in that long tunnel of time
    And I've turned inside out and around about and back and then
    Found myself right back where I started again

Once I had myself a million now I've only gate dime
The difference don't seem quite as bad today
With a nickel or a million I was serchin' all the time
For something that I'd never lost or left behind

   

Now I'm in my second circle and I'm headin' for the tip
I've leaned a lot of things along the way
I'll be careful when I'm climbin' cause thurts a lot to drop
When you're down nobody give a damm anywayI'm going across the deep blue sea
    In this country, tell me
    I'm all alone so sad and blue
    My every thought is just fo you

In these long years that I spent here
I onely wish that you were here
To the dizzy fog and a mist of rain
I can see you strolling right down the lane

   

Someday darling I will return
Then our hearts will no longer yearn
things will be just like before
Just your and I forever more

 * refrainHow can I keep from crying ?
How can I keep from crying ?
How can I keep from crying ?
For I never expect to see you anymore

    My home's across the blue ridge mountains
    My home's across the blue ridge mountains
    Home's across the blue ridge mountains
    And I never expect to see you anymore

Oh, how I hate to leave you
Oh, how I hate to leave you
Oh, how I hate to leave you
For I never expect to see you anymore

   

So goodbye, my little darling
So goodbye, my little darling
So goodbye, my little darling
I never expect to see you anymoreAbilene, abilene prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there will treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene
I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carrying me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene

Crowded city, there ain't nothing free
Nothing in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene, sweet AbileneIt still grieves me when I wander
To the grave not far away
Where we laid my little darling
Just a year ago today

It broke my heart so when she left
But she did not go alone
The greatest part of me went with her
The day the savior called her home

As I looked back across my life time
As I journey on and on
I bless the days that I had with her
And I leave the rest to God

In a grave so dark and lonely
Neath the cold and silent clay
There we laid my little darling
Just a year ago todayMany thousand miles away in that land across the sea
There are soldier boys, their precious lives they give
So their loved ones here back home, many miles across the foam
Might have liverty each padding day to live

    May they sleep forevermore
    Where a white cross stands to mark the soldiers grave
    May their spirits be at rest
    They have done their part with hearts so true and brave

May the ones who have gone on be remembered here back home
In the hears of those whom they will see no more
They will wait until that day when they hear the trumpet play
Then they'll march again upon that golden shoreOft' my mothers drift back to childhood
To the time when I was free
As I played befodre the fireside
Round my darling mother's knee

    There's a blessed home up yonder
    Where my loved ones wait for me
    I saw mother in a vision
    Kneeling there to pray for me

Then one day our mother left us
Daddy said she'd gone to rest
I remember how she loved me
As she clutched me to her breast

 

Some sweet day I'll meet you mother
You little bay is coming home
To see you as in days of childhood
The one you loved and left aloneHe was just a little farm lad so busy at play
In his little play house down by the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate

Then he saw his Daddy watching too
As the man swiftly walked to the cottage door
He knew they were strangers that come from the town
Men he had never seen before

They soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no, he cried, dear God don't let it be
They can't take my sweetheart away

I know Dad that you don't understand
How a heart so young can conceive a plan
I'm only seven now but it's just like you said
Dad someday  I'll be a man

The man who wons the farm where your playmate now lives
He told me it'd have to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done
So now they are moving away

Let us buy the farm so they can stay
Give them all my toys that dear Santa gave
And give him the pennies in my little bank
Pennies tht my darling helped me saveAnother heart is broken, another home so sad
Another message has been sent to his Mom and Dad
Your son was killed in action was the way the message read
Your son will not be coming home, they told me he was dead

    They sent him to Viet Nam, his heart was young and gay
    It's hard for me to realize they'll bring him home this way
    His troubles are all over, his work on earth is done
    A mother has a purple heart in memory of her son

Just a few short months ago he was here with me
And then they called his number to go across the sea
I still can hear his smiling voice and see his curly head
Oh somehow I can't believe out body boy is deadIn my memory there's a picture of a face so dear to me
Loving arms that used to hold me as I sat on mother's knee
No one here on earth could pay her for the things in life she gave
Now she's gone but I'll remember
A pretty wreath for mother's grave

    She was fond of pretty flowers I recall she used to say
    When I'm gone son please remember
    A pretty wreath for mother's grave

She had a little row of flowers that she used to watch each day
She fixed them just before God called her so they would not fade away
Next year they'll bloom again in beauty red and blue so bright and gay
If it's God's will I'll take them to her, a pretty wreath for mother's graveA pathway of teardrops will show you the way
If you ever want to come back to me
You know dear,that I've cried both night and day
Since you told me you'd never be free

I love you so still I let's you go
Now I'm sending this message to you
A pathway of tearddrops will show you the way
If you ever want to come back to meI turned the key in the lock tonight
And I walked slowly into the room
You're presence hung like a heavy mist
And I knew death had come too soon

    The stars may be shining for somebody else
    The moon may be giving it's light
    But all that I have is a memory of you
    And I'm lost in a world black as night

Death came too soon to the one that I loved
And now I must travel alone
Just a wandering boy with a broken heart
Who's sweetheart and pal is now gone

 

I'll travel on thru this world of despair
I'll just force myself to go on
I find myself wishing every day
I could be with her in the beyondIn a war torn land of poverty somewhere across the sea
A little boy is waitin' he looks a lot like me
His hair is like the sunlight on the wings of a crow
I don't know whawt they named him, but I'm sure they called him Joe

    Just a little boy called Joe like so many more I know
    Left all alone somewhere across the sea
    I want him to have my name, little Joe mine to claim
    A little boy called Joe belongs to me

His mother died to give him life, the night my orders came
I wanted to be with him but war's an evil thing
Now he won't recongnize me but I've got to let him know
He means much more to some one than just a little boy called joeAfter travering through this world of sorrow
no one on earth to call my friend
I'm on my way back to ole' Kentucky
Where I met and loved but could not win

I've always loved you little darling
My heart will always feel the same
I could never do one thing to hurt you
I'd rather die than bring you shame

When thatcold dark shroud is wrapped around me
They lay myu weary head to rest 
Will you stand around and gaze upon me
For I'm the one that loved you best

When your golden hair is turned to silver
The master calls your soul to heaven
Where we can be free from all our troubles
I'm meet you there at journey's endI've wandered by the village, Tom
I've sat beneath the tree
Upon the school house playing ground
That sheltered you and me

    But none are left to greet me, Tom
    And few are left to know
    That played with us upon the green
    Just fifteen years ago

The river's running just as still
The willows on its side
Are larger that they were, dear Tom
The stream appears less wide

   

But in kneeling down beside the stream
Dear Tom, I startied so
To see how sadly I am changed
Since fifteen years ago

   

But when our time shall come, dear Tom
And we are called to go
I hope they'll us where we played
Just fifteen years agoWell a hundred years from now I won't be crying
    A hundred years from now I won't be blue
    And my heart would have forgotton she broke ever vow
    I won't care a hundred years from now

Oh,it seem like yesterday you told me
You couldn't live without my love somehow
Now that you're with another it breaks my heart somehow
I won't care a hundred years from now

  

Now do you recall the night sweetheart you promised
Another's kiss you never would allow
That's all in the past dear it didn't seem to last
I won't care a hundred years from nowOh love makes a home and you never feel alone
It's always there any way that you turn
But if love is faded out you will know without a doubt
That the home you're living in is just a house

Oh, the house will tumble down when there's no love around
Love is the key that fits all the doors
Oh you take the love away and it's just another day
To live in a home it's just a houseWhippoorwills and daffodils are pretty things
All the works of nature that we see each spring
All the pretty color at a rainbow's end
Could never match the beauty on your face I've seen

    You brought me laughter you gave me joy
    You brought me pleasure like a kid with a christmas toy
    You brought the sunshine from up above
    And that's not all you bought you gave me love

Honey suckles morning glories around my door
Honey bees that gather nectar and much more
Smiling faces children's laughter,skies above
All that I could ask for then you gave me lovePardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me darling should I cry
When you're gone I'll dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I


Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You thaught me how to love and now you say that we are thru
I'm a fool but I love you dear until the end of time
Now and then there's a fool such as IOn an evening long ago as the sun was sinking low
My true lover went to sail up in the sea
It was in the month of June when the roses were in bloom
When he tucked me in his arms and said to me

    You're a flower that is blooming in the wildwood
    A flower that is blooming there for me
    Sweeter than the morning dew and I'll soon return to you
    You're a flower that is blooming  there for me

Then a letter came to me from the captain on the sea
That told me my darling was dead
Oh hte shock and great surprise surprise made the teardrops dim my eye
When I thought about the last words that he said

 

Now he can't return to me he got drowned in the sea
And has done passed over life's weary way
When it's in the month of June and the roses are in bloom
It seems that I can hear my lover sayA lock of your hair and a faded red ribbon
Is all I have left to remind me of you
A lock of your hair and a faded red ribbon
Is all I have left of a love we onece knew
Is all I have left of a love we onece knew

I know I mistreated you and you went away
You found somebody new and now I must pay
Listen here boys if you have a sweetheart
Show her you love her and make her your wife
For the lock of her hair and a faded red ribbon
Will make you unhappy for the rest of your life
Will make you unhappy for the rest of your life

listen here boys is you have a sweetheart
Show her you love her and make her your wifeA face in the crowd on your wedding day
You tossed me a rose bud from your bridal bouquet
No one seemed to notice no one wondered why
When you pledged your love to me there was tears in my eyes

    A face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose
    Your gown of white satin, my falf worn out clothes
    I knew your love one time but your love now he holds
    I'm a face in the crowd with a pale yellow rose

As your friends they all kissed you, I heard someone say
That man with a rose bud from your bridal bouquet
Was he kinda special or was he just a friend
I heard you speak softly he's only a friend
